Company Overview 
 RTI Surgical Holdings, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, (RTI or the Company), is a global surgical implant company that designs, develops, manufactures and distributes biologic, metal and synthetic implants. Our implants are used in orthopedic, spine, sports medicine, plastic surgery, trauma and other surgical procedures to repair and promote the natural healing of human bone and other human tissues and improve surgical outcomes. We manufacture metal and synthetic implants and process donated human musculoskeletal and other tissue and bovine and porcine animal tissue in producing allograft and xenograft implants using our proprietary BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST® and CANCELLE® SP sterilization processes. We process tissue at our facilities in Alachua, Florida and Neunkirchen, Germany and manufacture metal and synthetic implants in Marquette, Michigan and Greenville, North Carolina, respectively, and we have a distribution and research center in Wurmlingen, Germany. We are accredited in the United States by the American Association of Tissue Banks and we are a member of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed). Our implants are distributed directly to hospitals and free-standing surgery centers throughout the United States and in over 50 countries worldwide with the support of both our and third-party representatives as well as through larger purchasing companies. 
Strategy 
 In 2019, we continued to implement a focused strategy to expand our spine and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) operations and create long-term, profitable growth for the company. The core components of our strategy were: 

 | Reduce Complexity. We worked to reduce complexity in our organization by divesting non-core assets and investing in core competencies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Drive Operational Excellence. We worked to optimize material cost and drive operational efficiency to reduce other direct costs by pursuing world class manufacturing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Accelerate Growth. We invested in innovative, niche high growth product categories leveraging core competency in the spine market; utilizing core technologies to expand OEM relationships and drive organic growth; and building relevant scale in our spinal portfolio to improve our importance to the consolidating healthcare market driven increasingly by integrated delivery networks and group purchasing organizations.

 The OEM Purchase Agreement contemplates that, prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the OEM Purchase Agreement (the OEM Closing), RTI will undergo an internal reorganization, pursuant to which, in addition to certain inter-company transfers and mergers, RTI and its subsidiaries will transfer to the OEM Group Companies the assets primarily used in the operation of the Business (Contribution Assets) and the OEM Group Companies will assume certain liabilities that are related to the OEM Business (collectively, the Reorganization). In addition to the Reorganization, RTI is required to use reasonable best efforts to separate the assets and liabilities, and the operating mechanisms, of the U.S. metals business and the U.S. biologics business into two separate companies prior to the OEM Closing. As part of such separation, another subsidiary of RTI, established to hold the assets and liabilities of the U.S. metals business, will constitute a Company and be sold as part of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and each of the agreements ancillary to the Purchase Agreement (the Contemplated Transactions) to an affiliate of the Buyer. The affiliate of the Buyer established for this purpose would be an additional Buyer under the Purchase Agreement. 
 The Contemplated Transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, the approval of the Contemplated Transactions by the Companys stockholders. The parties currently expect to close the Contemplated Transactions in the third quarter of 2020. Following the OEM Closing, RTI will focus exclusively on the design, development and distribution of spinal implants to the global market. 
 Segments 
 As noted below in Item 8, Note 5, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reorganized into two business lines, which are also our operating and reportable segments: Spine and OEM. We distribute human tissue, bovine and porcine animal tissue, metal and synthetic implants through various distribution channels: Spine (Direct Domestic and Direct International) and OEM (OEM Domestic, Direct Sports and OEM International).

 COVID-19 
 As discussed in more detail throughout this Form 10-K, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the corresponding governmental response and the Companys management of the crisis has had a significant impact on the Companys business. The consequences of the outbreak and impact on the economy continues to evolve and the full extent of the impact is uncertain as of the date of this filing. The outbreak has already brought a significant disruption to the operations of the Company. 
 Hospitals and other medical facilities have canceled elective surgeries, reduced and diverted staffing and diverted resources to patients suffering from the infectious disease and limited hospital access for non-patients, including our direct and indirect sales representatives. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons and their patients are required, or are choosing, to defer procedures in which our products otherwise would be used, and many facilities that specialize in the procedures in which our products otherwise would be used have closed or reduced operating hours. These circumstances have negatively impacted the ability of our employees and distributors to effectively market and sell our products. In addition, even after the pandemic has subsided and/or governmental orders no longer prohibit or recommend against performing such procedures, patients may continue to defer such procedures out of concern of being exposed to coronavirus or for other reasons. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused adverse effects on general commercial activity and the global economy, which has led to an economic slowdown or recession, and which has adversely affected our business, operating results or financial condition. The adverse effect of the pandemic on the broader economy has also negatively affected demand for procedures using our products, and could cause one or more of our distributors, customers, and suppliers to experience financial distress, cancel, postpone or delay orders, be unable to perform under a contract, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business. This could impact our ability to manufacture and provide products and otherwise operate our business, as well as increase our costs and expenses. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of future capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets in the future. 
 The above and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, prospects and the trading price of our common stock in the near-term and beyond 2020. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the possibility that new adverse information may emerge concerning COVID-19 and additional actions to contain it or treat its impact may be required. 
 Industry Overview 
 Defects in bone and other human tissue can be caused by a variety of sources including trauma, congenital defects, aging, revision of joint replacements, infectious disease, cancer and other similar conditions. The predominant method used to repair injured or defective bone and tissue is surgical intervention, primarily through the use of surgical implants. When considering a surgical procedure for bone or tissue repair, surgeons and patients have a number of treatment options including: 

 | metals and synthetics;
--+-----------------------


 | xenograft tissue from an animal source;
--+------------------------------------------


 | autograft tissue from the patient; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | allograft tissue from another human donor.
--+---------------------------------------------

 Depending on the specific surgery, surgeons may elect to use any number of these treatment options. We offer a broad line of metal, synthetic, xenograft and allograft solutions to meet their needs. 
 Metals and Synthetics 
 The medical community has used metal and synthetic materials for implant procedures for many years. Metal and synthetic technologies are used to create both surgical implants as well as instruments used in surgical procedures. These implants are used in a variety of procedures in spine, cardiothoracic, trauma and other areas. Typical metals used include surgical stainless steel and titanium. These materials are chosen for their strength and durability. Synthetic implants provide alternative implant options for surgeons and reliable availability due to the variable supply of xenograft, autograft and allograft. One common example of a synthetic material is polyetheretherketone (PEEK). A recent trend has emerged for advanced materials in spinal interbodies. RTI has a position in that space through its Fortilink family of products, which is produced by additive manufacturing (i.e. 3-D printing) using a proprietary polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) material called TETRAfuse® 3-D. The Companys exclusive supplier of TETRAfuse® 3-D is Oxford Performance Materials, Inc. 
 Xenograft Tissue 
 Xenograft tissue-based implants are common in many areas of medicine including cardiac and vascular procedures, soft tissue repair and wound care. Xenograft based implants are also used in the repair of bone defects in orthopedic surgery as carriers for demineralized bone matrix and bone morphogenic protein products. The production of xenograft implants involves recovering animal tissue, typically from cattle (bovine) or pigs (porcine), processing and sterilization, and then transplanting the xenograft implant into a human patient. 
Autograft and Allograft Tissue 
 Many surgeons use autograft and allograft tissue in their surgical procedures to take advantage of their natural characteristics. Autograft procedures involve a surgeon harvesting tissue from one part of a patients body for transplant to another part of the body. Allograft tissues are recovered from cadaveric donors, processed for certain intended uses and then transplanted by a surgeon into the patients body to make the needed repair. 
 Autograft and allograft bone implants are not only osteoconductive, meaning they provide a scaffold for new bone to attach itself to, but can be osteoinductive as well, meaning they stimulate the growth of new tissue. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 We market and distribute our implants through direct distribution channels and a combination of both exclusive and non-exclusive OEM distributors depending upon the product category. Our implants are used in the following markets: spine, sports medicine, orthobiologics, trauma, dental, plastic surgery and other surgical specialties. Our implants range from metals, synthetics, allografts and xenografts that are precision machined for specific surgical applications, to grafts conventionally processed for general surgical uses.

 Direct Channels 
 Spine 
 The human spine consists of four regions: cervical (neck region), thoracic (back region attached to the ribs), lumbar (lower back), and sacral (tail bone). We design, manufacture, and distribute surgical implants, instruments, and biologics used in the treatment of conditions affecting the spine caused by degenerative conditions, deformities or traumatic injury. Our principal implant offering includes a wide variety of systems composed of components such as spine screws and rods, spinal spacers, plates, and various biologics offerings all designed to support, enhance, or promote spinal fusion. Our principal implant offerings by market segment are as follows: 

 | Thoracolumbar: Streamline® TL Spinal Fixation System, Quantum® Spinal Fixation System, Streamline® MIS Spinal Fixation System, MIS FusionTM Instrumentation, Contact® Anterior Lumbar Plate System

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Synthetics: nanOss® advanced bone graft substitute
--+---------------------------------------------------

Sports 
 Many repetitive use and sports-related injuries can be addressed with allograft implants. The most prevalent surgeries in the knee include repairs to the anterior cruciate ligament, articular cartilage repair, and meniscus transplantation. The most prevalent surgeries in the shoulder include rotator cuff repair and articular cartilage repair. Our principal sports medicine allografts are tendons for ligament reconstruction, fresh osteochondral grafts for cartilage repair, and our meniscal allografts for advanced meniscus injuries. Many of our sports medicine tendon allografts utilize our patented pre-shaped technology, which greatly reduces preparation time in the operating room and are generally easier to implant than non pre-shaped allografts. We also distribute Matrix HD human dermis implants for wound repair and soft tissue augmentation. We also market and distribute implants for abdominal wall repair, and plastic and reconstructive surgery. These implants are processed through our validated Tutoplast tissue sterilization process, which has a proven track record of safety and performance. Principal products include Cortiva human dermis, Fortiva porcine dermis and Tutopatch and Tutomesh bovine pericardium. 
 OEM Channels 
 We also market and distribute our implants through relationships with OEM distributors. 
 Our spine interbody allograft implants are marketed and distributed domestically through our non-exclusive relationships with Aesculap Implant Systems, Inc., Integra Life Sciences Corporation (Integra), Medtronic, PLC (Medtronic), Orthofix International NV (Orthofix), Stryker Spine, a division of Stryker Corporation (Stryker), and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer).

 International 
 Internationally we market and distribute our implants through a direct distribution organization and a network of independent distributors. 
 The BIOCLEANSE® Tissue Sterilization Process 
 We have developed and utilized in the United States the patented BIOCLEANSE® tissue sterilization process, which is an automated, pharmaceutical grade chemical sterilization process for musculoskeletal bone and certain soft tissue. This process is fully validated to kill or inactivate all classes of conventional pathogens, viruses, microbes, bacteria and fungi. Our BIOCLEANSE® process is able to remove greater than 99% of the blood, fats, lipids and other unwanted materials from the tissue we process. An important element of the BIOCLEANSE® process is that while it removes unwanted materials embedded within the tissue, it maintains the tissues structural integrity and compression strength. Studies have shown that bone tissue sterilized with the BIOCLEANSE® process maintains the same compression strength as untreated tissue. 
 The BIOCLEANSE® process has been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which concluded that BIOCLEANSE® was a validated tissue sterilization process demonstrated to prevent contamination of tissue grafts. To our knowledge, no other tissue sterilization process related to human tissue in our industry has been reviewed or approved by the FDA. It should be noted that the FDA does not have a formal approval process in place for tissue related processing techniques. 
 Two types of preserved allografts are processed using the BIOCLEANSE® process: soft tissue, consisting of tendons and cartilage; and bone tissue, consisting of various configurations of cancellous and cortical bone material. Tendons and cartilage are used to repair/replace native tissue primarily in sports medicine reconstructive surgeries. Processed cortical and cancellous bone materials are used in a wide variety of applications in spine and orthopedic surgeries. 
 The TUTOPLAST® Tissue Sterilization Process 
 The TUTOPLAST® tissue sterilization process utilizes solvent dehydration and chemical inactivation to remove blood, lipids and extraneous materials, and inactivate viruses and break down RNA and DNA into fragments not capable of replication and disease transmission while preserving the biological and mechanical properties. 
 Two types of preserved allografts are processed using the TUTOPLAST® process: soft tissue, consisting of fascia lata, pericardium, dermis, sclera and cornea; and bone tissue, consisting of various configurations of cancellous and cortical bone material. Processed pericardium, fascia lata and dermis are collagenous tissue used to repair, replace or line native connective tissue primarily in dental, ophthalmology, urology, plastic and reconstructive surgeries. Dermis is also used in hernia repair and pelvic floor reconstruction. Sclera and cornea are used in ophthalmology procedures such as anterior and posterior segment patch grafting applications for glaucoma, retina and trauma surgery and oculoplastics, as well as contour wrapping of an orbital implant. Processed cortical and cancellous bone material is used in a wide variety of applications in spine, orthopedic and dental surgeries. 
  The CANCELLE® SP DBM Sterilization Process 
 DBM-based pastes and putties are sterilized through the CANCELLE® SP process, which is designed to preserve protein activity. In their final form, the DBM implants serve as bone void fillers in many applications, including spinal, general orthopedic, joint reconstruction and dental surgeries. 
 CANCELLE® SP is a proprietary process that sterilizes DBM pastes and putties while simultaneously allowing them to maintain their osteoinductive (OI) potential, which is verified by 100% lot testing after sterilization. The determination of OI potential is made by lot release animal studies or testing for certain protein markers. These tests are not necessarily predictive of human clinical results. Through a combination of oxidative treatments and acid or alcohol washes, debris is removed and pathogens are inactivated. Cleansing rinses remove residual chemicals, maintaining biocompatibility and preserving the utility of the graft. The CANCELLE® SP irradiation dose is delivered terminally for most pastes and putties to achieve device-level sterility (SAL 10-6). 
  Tissue Recovery 
 Tissue recovery is the actual removal of tissue from a donor after legal authorization has been obtained. Authorization is obtained by the tissue recovery group. We contract with independent FDA registered tissue recovery groups that specialize in this activity. Tissue recovery personnel aseptically recover tissue within 24 hours following a donors death, using surgical instruments and sterile techniques similar to those used in hospitals for routine surgery. Recovered tissue is placed on wet or dry ice, then transported by the donor recovery agency to the tissue processor or possibly a research institution. 
 Under U.S. law, human tissue cannot be bought and sold. However, the law permits the recovery of reasonable payments for the provision of certain services, such as those involved in recovering, processing and storing tissue and related to the advancement of tissue processing technologies; all types of activities in which we are involved. 
 
5 


 Donor recovery groups recover a variety of tissue types from donors including the fibula, femur, tibia, humerus, ilium, pericardium, fascia lata, dermis, costal cartilage, sclera, tendons and ligaments. We believe that our established relationships with recovery organizations are sufficient to meet our ongoing operation demands. These contracted tissue recovery organizations are responsible for obtaining appropriate authorization and conducting federally-mandated donor screening, such as a donor risk assessment interview with the next of kin. Each donor is evaluated against current acceptance criteria prior to donor tissue being sent to our processing facility. Upon receipt of the tissue, we conduct pre-processing donor screening to determine donor medical suitability for transplantation. Pre-processing screening performed by us includes laboratory testing and a donor medical eligibility assessment. With respect to laboratory testing, we perform an extensive panel of serological and microbiological tests using Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment (CLIA) approved laboratories and FDA test kits. These results are subject to stringent criteria in order to release the donor tissue to the processing stage. 
 We have relationships with tissue donor recovery agencies across the United States. We also have relationships outside the United States. We believe additional recovery group relationships would be available if needed and consequently that the loss of any one of our sources of donor tissue would not have a material impact on our operating results. 
 We continue to develop new xenograft tissue implants. Implants processed from xenograft tissue are regulated by the FDA as devices and require approval or licenses from the FDA prior to marketing in the United States. The sources of our bovine animal tissues are regulated closed herds. We believe that our established relationships with our sources of xenograft animal tissues are sufficient to meet our demands for our ongoing operations. We believe the continued development of our xenograft implants will help us meet unmet demand for certain allografts and also allow us to develop new biological implants that cannot currently be made due to structural limitations of human tissue. 
 Research and Development 
 Our strategy has been to develop new implants, technologies and surgical techniques within our current markets, and to develop additional technologies for other markets to address unmet clinical needs. We have done this by building on our core technology platforms: TETRAfuse® 3-D, BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST®, CANCELLE® SP, precision machining, assembled grafts, tissue-mediated osteoinduction and our metal and synthetics design and production expertise. We have worked and continue to work on developing differentiated technologies and investing in generating the necessary clinical data to drive demand and support appropriate reimbursement. We operate a dedicated research team working on advanced technologies, and have embedded development/technical teams who work with the business/marketing teams focused on expanding the scope and scale of existing competencies such as tissue machining and sterilization, and metal and synthetics manufacturing to meet specific surgical needs. 
 In 2019, we launched 6 new implants and product enhancements in spine, sports, and general orthopedics developed by our research and development teams. January 2018 marked the first clinical use of the Fortilink-TS and Fortilink-L product systems, which were followed by the full commercial launch of the Fortilink-TS system in May 2018. The Fortilink systems are the second and third in a family of devices to incorporate our TETRAfuse 3D Technology. Additionally, 2018 began the manufacture and initial commercial use of the Thorecon sternal closure system in association with our partner A&E. Enhancements were made to Streamline OCT system, continuing the history of continuously improved features and options; performance improvements were made to our synthetic biologic line with the release of nanOss 3D Plus. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our business depends upon the significant know-how and proprietary technology we have developed. To protect this know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, licenses, trademarks and confidentiality agreements. The effect of these intellectual property rights is to define zones of exclusive use of the covered intellectual property. The duration of patent rights generally is 20 years from the date of filing of priority application, while trademarks, once registered, are essentially perpetual. Our trademarks and service marks provide us and our implants with a certain amount of brand recognition in our markets. However, we do not consider any single patent, trademark or service mark material to our business strategy, financial condition or results of operations. We have also entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In addition, we rely on our substantial body of know-how, including proprietary tissue recovery techniques and processes, research and development, tissue processing and quality assurance. 
 Our proprietary BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST® and CANCELLE® SP sterilization processes are covered by one or more U.S. and/or foreign patents, patent applications or trade secrets. Other U.S. and foreign holdings include, without limitation, patents, patent applications or trade secrets relating to or covering certain precision machined allograft intervertebral spacers and other spinal implants; matrix compositions including various bone graft substitutes; membrane tissue implants; and ligament, tendon or meniscus reconstruction and repair with certain precision shaped and/or assembled bone and soft tissue implants, synthetic bone graft substitutes; interbody fusion and motion implants; spinal and orthopedic plates; spinal rods, cables and screws and spinal fixation systems and related instrumentation.

 The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the risk of an infringement claim against us, as well as the risk of a third party infringing on our patents, grows. While we attempt to ensure that our implants and methods do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights, our competitors may assert that our implants, and the methods we employ, are covered by patents held by them. In addition, our competitors may assert that future implants and methods we may employ infringe their patents. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected implant. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the medical implant industry is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. Companies within the industry compete on the basis of design of related instrumentation, efficacy of implants, relationships with the surgical community, depth of range of implants, scientific and clinical results and pricing. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, with much greater resources. In some cases, our customers compete with us in certain product categories. 
 Our principal competitors in the conventional allograft market include the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF), AlloSource Inc., Community Tissue Services (CTS), LifeLink Tissue Bank (LifeLink), JRF Ortho (JRF), LifeCell, Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan PLC and LifeNet Health, Inc. (LifeNet). Among our competitors in precision machined allograft are MTF, LifeNet and AlloSource. Other companies who process and distribute allograft pastes include Medtronic, AlloSource, Integra, Wright Medical Inc. and MTF. Companies who process and distribute xenograft tissue include Baxter, Inc., LifeCell, Cook Surgical, Becton Dickenson, Integra MTF, and Medtronic. 
 We consider our principal competitors in the metal and synthetic markets to include Medtronic, Stryker, Zimmer, Synthes, Globus Medical Group, Inc., NuVasive, Inc., Alphatec Holdings Inc., Spinal Elements Inc., Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc., SeaSpine Holdings Corporation, and Orthofix International NV. 
 Government Regulation and Corporate Compliance 
 Government Regulation 
 Government regulation plays a significant role in the processing/manufacturing and distribution of allograft tissue implants and medical devices. We procure, where applicable, process/manufacture, and market our allograft tissue implants and medical devices worldwide. Although some standardization exists, each country in which we do business has its own specific regulatory requirements. These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. While we believe that we are in material compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations, or their interpretation or application, will not adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, inability to market current products, criminal prosecution, and/or refusal of the government to authorize the marketing of new products. 
 In the United States, most of our allograft implants are regulated by the FDA solely under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1270 and 1271, Current Good Tissue Practice for Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (cGTPs). Xenograft tissues and some of our allograft-containing implants are regulated as medical devices and subject to FDA 21 CFR, Part 820 Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) for Medical Devices and related statutes from the FDA. In addition, our U.S. operation is subject to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance to the standards of the tissue bank industrys accrediting organization, the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). 
 In Germany, allografts are classified as drugs and the German government regulates such implants in accordance with German Drug Law. On April 7, 2004, the European Commission issued a human tissue directive to regulate allografts within the European Union (EU). Our Neunkirchen facility is presently licensed by the German Health Authorities and in compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, allowing us to market our human and animal tissue implants globally. 
 The FDA and international regulatory bodies conduct periodic compliance inspections of both our U.S. and our German processing facilities. All operations are registered with the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (the CDRH) for device manufacturing locations and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (the CBER) for human tissue recovery, processing and distribution locations and are certified to ISO 13485:2003 and transitioning to ISO 13485:2016. The Alachua facility is also accredited by the AATB and is licensed in the states of Florida, New York, California, Maryland, Delaware and Illinois. The Neunkirchen facility is registered with the German Health Authority as a pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturer and is subject to German Drug Law. We believe that worldwide regulation of allografts and xenografts is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implants and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients.

 We currently market and distribute allografts that are subject to the FDAs Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation and Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products regulations. Under these regulations, we are required to perform donor screening and infectious disease testing and to document this screening and testing for each donor from whom we process tissue, and to process tissues in compliance with cGTP. The FDA has authority under the rules to inspect human tissue processing facilities, and to detain, recall, or destroy tissues for which appropriate documentation and evidence of compliance is not available. We are not required to obtain pre-market approval or clearance from the FDA for allografts that meet the regulations definition of human tissue. 
 The FDA may regulate certain allografts as medical devices, drugs, or biologics, which would require that we obtain approval or product licensure from the FDA. This would occur in those cases where the allograft is deemed to have been more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non-homologous use. In general, homologous use occurs when tissue is used for the same basic function that it fulfilled in the donor. The definitional criteria for making these determinations appear in the FDAs rules. If the FDA decides that certain of our current or future allografts are more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non-homologous use, it would require licensure, approval or clearances of those allografts. Allografts requiring such pre-market review are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. We would be required to list these allografts as a drug, as a medical device, or as a biologic, and to manufacture them in specifically registered or licensed facilities in accordance with cGMPs. We would also be subject to post-marketing surveillance and reporting requirements. In addition, our manufacturing facilities and processes would be subject to periodic inspection to assess compliance with cGMPs. Our labeling and promotional activities would be subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of drugs, devices, and biologics is also subject to more intensive regulation than is the case for human tissue implants. 
 Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our implants distributed in the United States are subject to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our implants and facilities vary widely based on implant type and classification both in the United States, and from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will be covered by premarket notification (510(k)) clearance from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, with the Class II devices typically requiring the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval through the lengthy premarket approval application (PMA) process. Manufacturers of most Class II medical devices are required to obtain 510(k) clearance prior to marketing their devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to another legally marketed 510(k)-cleared predicate device. By regulation, the FDAs performance goals are to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 FDA review days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. 
 Class III medical devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDAs satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will typically conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulations (21 CFR Part 820) (QSR). FDA reviews of PMA applications generally can take between one and three years, or longer. 
 The medical devices that we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe that we have obtained, or will be able to obtain, all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our implants and that they are, or will be, in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. After an implant is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements may include, as applicable: product listing and establishment registration; QSRs, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations (including unique device identification (UDI) requirements), and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDAs recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals.

 We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDAs QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities outside the United States have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The EU has nationally transposed regulations based on the European Commission (EC) Medical Device Directives for the control of medical devices with which manufacturers must comply. New medical device regulation (MDR) replaced the medical device directives effective May 26, 2020. The MDR manufacturing plants must have received Conformitè Europèene (CE) certification from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the EU. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a CE mark. Products covered by the EC directives that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the EU. We have received certification for all currently existing manufacturing facilities and products that we distribute in the EU. 
 Effective May 26, 2020, the EUs new MDR (EU MDR) replaced the current medical device directives. All medical devices currently distributed in the EU under the medical device directives are likely impacted. The MDR may also include products, such as human tissue, not traditionally considered medical devices in the EU. Additionally, the MDR, among other things, increases regulatory requirements for several medical device groupings applicable to our implants distributed in the EU, including strengthening notified body oversight for Class I reusable surgical instruments, and up-classifying spinal devices in contact with the spinal column. As of April 23, 2020, implementation of the EU MDR has been delayed until May 26, 2021. 
 Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policy holders healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, third-party payers may challenge the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. 
 The False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, as well as state and international anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation, regulate the conduct of medical device companies interactions with the healthcare industry. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (3) prohibit inappropriate payment to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. RTI maintains a Compliance Program that incorporates the seven fundamental elements as set forth by the Office of the Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This facilitates RTIs compliance with requirements regarding the prohibition of inappropriate transfers of value in exchange for referrals or obtaining or retaining foreign business engagements, prohibition regarding the submission of inappropriate claims for reimbursement to federal healthcare programs, as well as generally ensuring ethical interactions with the healthcare industry both domestically and internationally. 
 Under Section 6002 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act) and similar state and international transparency reporting legislation, RTI is required to collect data regarding payments or other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and other persons in the healthcare industry. RTIs Compliance Program ensures all such payments and transfers of value are appropriate per the requirements of applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation and that all required data is reported to relevant governmental entities as called for by applicable transparency reporting legislation. 
 In addition, U.S. federal, state, and international laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. RTI complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) due to its status as a covered entity related to the provision of a health plan for its employees. RTI is not otherwise regulated by HIPAA, but voluntarily incorporates many HIPAA standards in its corporate policies regarding handling of health data it receives. At the international level, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (GDPR) applies to RTIs processing of personal data of residents of the EU. This law protects processing of all personal data by regulating collection, use, and disclosure as well as privacy and security requirements and imposes penalties for violations. RTI complies with this regulation for both general personal data as well as the higher sensitivity standards for health data and is implementing the standards of this regulation as part of corporate policy for processing of personal data from all jurisdictions.

Environmental 
 Our allografts and xenografts, as well as the chemicals used in processing natural tissues and also in the manufacturing of metal and synthetic implants, are handled and disposed of in accordance with country-specific, federal, provincial, regional, state and/or local regulations, as applicable. We contract with independent third parties to perform all gamma irradiation of our surgical implants. In view of the engagement of a third party to perform irradiation services, the requirements for compliance with radiation hazardous waste do not apply, and therefore we do not anticipate that having any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial condition. However, we are responsible for assuring that the service is being performed in accordance with applicable regulations. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 935 employees of which 190 were employed outside of the United States. Management believes its relations with its employees are good.
