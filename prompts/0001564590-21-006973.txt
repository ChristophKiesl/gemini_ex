BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 CIT Group Inc. is a bank holding company ("BHC") and a financial holding company ("FHC"). CIT Group Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively "we", "our", "CIT" or the "Company"), has $53.9 billion of earning assets and $43.1 billion of deposits at December 31, 2020. CIT was formed in 1908 and provides financing, leasing and advisory services, principally to middle-market companies in a wide variety of industries, primarily in North America. We also provide banking and related services to commercial and individual customers through our banking subsidiary, CIT Bank, N.A. ("CIT Bank" or the "Bank"), which includes a regional branch network of 80 branches and its online bank. 
 CIT is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("FRBNY") under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. CIT Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("OCC"). In addition, CIT Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
 On January 1, 2020, we acquired Mutual of Omaha Bank (“MOB”), the savings bank subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company and Omaha Financial Holdings, Inc. (“OFHI”). CIT paid approximately $1 billion as consideration, comprised of $850 million in cash and approximately 3.1 million shares of CIT Group Inc. common stock (valued at approximately $141 million at the time of closing). Total assets acquired were approximately $8.4 billion and deposits were approximately $7.0 billion. See Note 2 – Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Information (“Item 8”) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of or for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020 Form 10-K”) for additional information.
 On October 16, 2020, First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (“First Citizens”), the parent company of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company (“FCB”), and CIT Group Inc. jointly announced that they entered into a definitive agreement by and among First Citizens, FCB, FC Merger Subsidiary IX, Inc. and CIT, under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger (the “Merger Agreement”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, CIT stockholders will receive 0.062 shares of First Citizens Class A common stock for each share of CIT common stock they own. First Citizens stockholders will own approximately 61% and CIT stockholders will own approximately 39% of the combined company. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary covenants, such as non-solicitation obligations and other provisions, including a break-up fee of $64 million payable in certain circumstances. The Merger Agreement also provides certain termination rights for CIT and First Citizens, including, among others, if the merger has not been completed by October 15, 2021. The combined bank will be regulated by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.
 
The Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of 14 directors, the current 11 First Citizens Board members and 3 CIT Board members, including Ellen Alemany, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of CIT, Michael A. Carpenter, and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan, USN (Ret.).
The combined company will operate under the First Citizens name and will be headquartered in Raleigh, N.C., and will maintain significant operations in California, Nebraska, Arizona, Florida, and South Carolina, as well as in New York and New Jersey. The pro forma organization will include over $100 billion in assets and over $80 billion in deposits.
 On February 9, 2021, CIT and First Citizens received the approvals of the stockholders of CIT and First Citizens necessary to complete the merger of the companies.  The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.
