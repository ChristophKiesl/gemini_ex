Business Description
 
The global coronavirus outbreak has tested people, industries, governments and supply chains unlike any crisis since World War II. Manufacturers and suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been working overtime to increase production in response to unprecedented international demand. Like many companies Hawkeye Systems Inc. has been impacted by Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and has had to adapt and overcome several obstacles which previously did not exist. The Company’s initial focus was photography, videography, and AR focused, however in an environment that has evolved out of the pandemic, we determined that future technology or developing technology does not seem like a place to place the fortune of our shareholders. Consequently, we evolved to provide products that the market needs now while identifying opportunities which make sense operating in this environment. Once we shifted from developing technologies only to trying to service more urgent issues in the current environment, we began to locate, market and sell personal protection equipment (“PPE”) including sanitizer, masks and gloves. As we worked in this market, we have refined and further narrowed our strategy. Clearly several aspects of our “normal” business environment have become greatly disrupted. Government policy has become opaque and not supportive of small business, supply chains have become greatly disrupted and the US dependency on foreign countries has, to various degrees, become unreliable, expensive and unpredictable from the perspective of quality, availability and quantity. The management of Hawkeye made a difficult but defining moment in the last quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We decided that as a company we can only defend and support a strategy that can be executed in this environment with our available resources that supports the requirements and needs of our customers and of customers in the current environment. In prioritizing the list of important issues here is the short list of what will differentiate and ensure our success
 
1. Availability of product without significant price competition (dependable supply).
 
2. Quality and certification under all required standards.
 
3. Sales Strategy not dependent on government action or assistance.
 
4. Growth strategy that depends on sales volume and growth funding technological innovation and not innovation at the expense of volume that can sustain the company.
 
5. Technological innovation should be narrow in focus and support the mission of the company.

The company has made great strides and progress to this end. Here is a list of the big achievements over the last two quarters:
 
1. Developed and executed on a relationship with a dependable South Korean manufacturer to provide excellent sanitizer at a reasonable price in a sustainable way, which has subsequently been listed on Amazon.com; we continue to work with Amazon and other partners to increase traction in this channel.
 
2. Developed and executed a strategy with DemeTECH to provide US made, NIOSH approved, N95’s which are competitive with foreign imports but have the advantage of 100% US made, US sourced in a scalable, repeatable way, regardless of government decisions regarding PPE (excise tax, foreign raw materials, PPE import blocks , etc.)
 
3. Developed a project to build and control 5.4 M boxes of nitrile gloves per year at a price which is and will be competitive even post pandemic. We are currently trying to fund this project and make sure we have reliable nitrile rubber supply as this is the rate limiting step in providing gloves globally right now. 
 
Company Goals and Objectives
 
Hawkeye’s mission for the next fiscal year and beyond is to, through acquisition and organic growth, become one of the largest US providers of PPE in the categories we compete in. We intend to do this through organic sales, acquisition and partnership. We have not abandoned our technology origins and in fact with financial strength we will reveal and roll out innovations closely aligned with the categories we are competing in.
 
US and World Markets for PPE
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets. In response, many countries implemented business closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and social distancing ordinances and similar measures to combat the pandemic, which significantly impacted global business and dramatically reduced demand for certain medical products in the second quarter of 2020. Demand increased in the third quarter resulting in growth over the prior year driven by sales of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 related products.
 
Manufacturers are engaged in a historic effort to ramp up production of the vital equipment needed to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. While respirators like N95 masks have received the greatest attention from the public and media, PPE needs also include protective garments, eye and face protection, gloves, and other components of the specialized ensembles health care professionals use to protect themselves.
 
Initially, there was a significant shortage of PPE products. Broadly speaking, no one knew a pandemic on this scale was coming. It has literally been a century since the last truly global health crisis. In addition, over the past few decades, both for budgetary and efficiency reasons, healthcare organizations — just like most other sectors of the economy — adopted a “just in time” approach to ordering supplies. That philosophy worked until this crisis hit. There are policy solutions that can help to supply equipment during a crisis, some of which have been partially successful at this time, and others that were not in place. These range from stockpiling equipment to subsidizing inventory. 
 
Sanitizer is expected to have compound annual growth rate exceeding 23.1% through 2027.1 Mask growth is expected to have a 11.5% compound annual growth rate over the period of from 2020 to 2025.2 Finally, the global nitrile gloves market size is anticipated to reach USD 8.98 billion by 2027.3 That market is projected to register a compound annual growth rate of 14.1% over the forecast period.

We are focused on sourcing sustainable supply that will be cost effective and competitive assuming that the pandemic becomes less important and reduces in severity. There is a tremendous backlog of supplies which need to be re-stockpiled and we intend to compete in the long-term market not just work in the near term during the pandemic. 
 
The United States has issued significant pandemic relief bills which covers PPE and other essential materials during the pandemic.  This funding is greatly needed and will help increase sales and move forward sale cycles which were stopped due to lack of funding.  Many of the potential buyers of our products exhausted their budget for PPE mid-year or even earlier in 2020 so this relief greatly improves the ability for customers to stop rationing critical supplies and provide their medical and front line workers the appropriate amount and level of protection to these important essential workers.
 
Research and Development 
 
The products which we are looking at for potential R&D and future funding are further out than the next few quarters so our limited resources will be focused on succeeding in the strategy to address the market needs as we have defined them. 
Intellectual Property
 
The company currently does not have IP and this is not part of our current strategy. 
 
Regulation
 
Our current business involves the distribution, importation and sale of PPE and other medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and sale of medical devices. Additionally, government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there has been an emphasis on efforts to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for medical devices. Also, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impact our financial performance. For example, certain laws and regulations restricting medical PPE products in the United States have been temporarily modified or waived in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our business is generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance, including securities, antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-kickback, customer interaction transparency, data privacy, data security, price gouging and other laws and regulations, and some of the related rules have been temporarily modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.

It is our hypothesis that due to entanglements with the US government and federal procurement processes the typical providers including 3m and Honeywell will be somewhat hamstrung in their ability to grow to meet the demands of these growing marketplaces until they meet the demands of the federal government which we don’t expect to be in the near future. Other US providers such as Prestige Ameritech are impacted by their access to capital and their current inability to scale to the market demands.

Prior Investment in Radiant Images, Inc.
 
On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Radiant Images, Inc., a California corporation (“Radiant”), as well as Radiant’s shareholder Gianna Wolfe (“Wolfe”) and key employee, Michael Mansouri (“Mansouri”), pursuant to which the Company would acquire 100% of the shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Radiant from Wolfe, resulting in acquisition of Radiant.
 
In April 2020, the Company received notice from Radiant Images of their intent to terminate the acquisition agreement. Although the Company believes that the termination is not legally valid, the Company has ceased further discussions with respect to the acquisition and is pursuing litigation for repayment of amounts due by Radiant. The Company’s investment in Radiant was structured as a revolving note has been classified as a Note Receivable from Radiant due with accrued but unpaid interest. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving note, Radiant is required to repay the money already invested to Hawkeye with interest. The note receivable was issued on April 26, 2019, is due upon demand of the Company at any time commencing April 26, 2020. The interest rate on the note is 12% and accrues daily on the outstanding balance. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, total contributions of $385,000 were made to Radiant, bringing the balance of the note receivable to $1,305,800 at June 30, 2020 (not including interest). At June 30, 2020 interest income of $154,042 had been accrued on the note. Under accounting treatment, this note and interest are impaired on our balance sheet while we undertake litigation to resolve this dispute. Nevertheless the Company intends to vigorously pursue this matter and litigation and believes that this amount is fully collectible from Radiant and/or its principals.

Legal Proceedings
 
On November 13, 2019 5W Public Relations LLC filed a complaint against Hawkeye Systems, Inc. relating to payments allegedly due under a contract for public relations services. That complaint has not been served on Hawkeye. Hawkeye vigorously disputes the allegations in the complaint as 5W Public Relations provided virtually no services to Hawkeye during the term of this arrangement but was paid a substantial amount of funds. Hawkeye will not only defend the litigation when and if it is served, but will also provide counterclaims for failure of consideration, fraud in the inducement, general fraud and other causes of action. Hawkeye anticipates that this litigation if pursued will be resolved favorably for the Company.
