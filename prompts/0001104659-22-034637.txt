Item 1. Business
​
Overview
​
We are an infant and juvenile products company doing business under the name SUMR Brands. We are a recognized authority in the juvenile product industry, providing parents and caregivers a full range of innovative, high-quality, and high-value products to care for babies and toddlers. We seek to improve the quality of life of parents, caregivers, babies and toddlers through our product offerings, while at the same time maximizing shareholder value over the long term.
​
We operate in one principal industry segment across geographically diverse marketplaces, selling our products globally to large, national retailers as well as independent retailers, on our partner’s websites, and our own direct to consumer website. In North America, our customers include Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, Target, Buy Buy Baby, Home Depot, and Lowe’s. Our largest European-based customer is Smyths Toys. We also sell through international distributors and representatives in geographic locations where we do not have a direct sales presence and directly to select international retail customers. Our company was originally founded in 1985 and has publicly traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market since 2007 under the symbol “SUMR”.
​
We aim to become a globally recognized leader in the juvenile product industry by creating products that families everywhere need, want, love and depend on. To support future growth, we will continue to seek to develop and launch new juvenile products based on consumer demand, while also strengthening our core product offerings. In addition to organic growth, we will consider acquisitions of products or businesses. We have strong partnerships with our suppliers in the U.S., Mexico, and Asia. We believe that our ability to develop products that are preferred by consumers gives us a competitive advantage in meeting our customer demands. We have long-standing relationships with our brick and mortar and e-commerce retail customers in the U.S. and will continue to focus on strengthening them to increase our presence in stores and online. We intend to continue managing our operational costs through ongoing SKU reductions and rationalization, warehouse labor reductions, leasehold rationalization and the subletting of

excess space where applicable. Additionally, we plan on continuing to increase our direct import business and to shift manufacturing to areas where container and other transportation costs are more cost efficient.
Leveraging our strength in product development, global sourcing and sales to national retailers, independent retailers, international distributors and ecommerce (pureplay and omni-channel), we are launching a new brand into the pet space, Ozzy & Kazoo ™, in 2022. Our focus is on creating products that complement our juvenile development and sourcing strategy, as well as a well-rounded product offering to highlight our brand in this new category, such as gates, pet beds and other pet supplies. By providing high quality, innovative pet products, our goal is to establish SUMR Brands as an authority in pet products, similar to our position as a recognized authority in the juvenile products industry. Initial products are anticipated to launch during the second quarter of 2022. In 2021, we began selling certain of our current products, primarily gates, under the brand name “Summer” in pet channels, including Chewy, Inc., though sales in 2021 were not material. We believe our entry into the pet products is an opportunity for incremental growth.
​
Products
​
We currently market our juvenile products in several product categories, including gates, potty, bath, entertainers, specialty blankets, strollers, car seats and travel systems. We are a North American market leader in the bath and potty categories. We market our core products under our Summer™ and SwaddleMe® brand names.
​
Within gates, we offer a product range of more than 30 products. Our line of gates offers versatility that covers use in home, ease of installation, and aesthetically pleasing designs. We continue to receive positive feedback from retailers as we expand our portfolio with consumer preferred features and styling.
​
We first entered the infant bathing category in 2002, and we have continued to create useful and safe solutions for bathing. Our innovative bath product, My Bath Seat™, continues to be extremely popular with consumers. We have an established roadmap for developing products in the three subcategories of bathing (bathers, bathtubs, and bath seats) to address consumer needs as baby grows, and to create loyalty to our brands.
​
We are a North American market leader in potties, and 2021 was a strong year in potty. We launched four new products, the My Travel™ Potty, the 3-in-1 Sit ‘N Play, My Size ® Lights & Songs and My Size ® Lights & Songs Transitions, further growing our breadth and depth of assortment that supports different consumer needs and various price points.
​
We are a North American market leader in the convenience segment of strollers. Our 3Dlite® Convenience Stroller continues to be a favorite among parents. We have continued to expand our range of convenience stroller platforms to appeal to the experienced parent. In addition, in 2020, we launched the Myria modular travel system and the Affirm 335 infant car seat that attract first time expectant parents to our products.
​
Our specialty blankets include SwaddleMe® specialty blankets as well as our expanded line of Slumber Buddy soothers. Acquired in 2008, SwaddleMe® continues to be a trusted brand synonymous with infant safe sleep. In 2021, we added a new stage 3 Night Sack and introduced our Velboa soft touch fabrics which have been well received in the market. 
​
We currently also offer audio and video monitors under the Summer™ brand. Our monitors feature high quality components, intended to fulfill the desire for consumers to connect with baby at any time or place.
​
In 2021, we began selling certain of our current products primarily gates, under the brand name “Summer” in pet channels, including Chewy, Inc., and, as noted above, in 2022, we will launch a new brand into the pet space, Ozzy & Kazoo ™, with an initial assortment of pet care products, including gates, pet beds and other pet supplies.
​
Product Development and Design
​
A thorough understanding of our consumer, the competition, and our customer retail partners drives our product development. Developing and marketing innovative solutions are a critical element of our strategy. We strive to produce proprietary products that offer distinctive benefits, are visually appealing, and provide safe, thoughtful solutions.
​
We conduct market analyses in our geographic regions of priority, evaluate identified opportunities, and design products accordingly. The majority of our products are currently designed at our Rhode Island headquarters. When appropriate, we also partner 

4




with manufacturers in Asia on product development. In addition to new product development, we continuously look for ways to improve upon existing products based on consumer insights with a strong focus on the end-user experience.
​
Suppliers and Manufacturing
​
We source our products globally from a variety of suppliers and manufacturers, including from China, Vietnam, Mexico and the United States. We are not dependent on any one supplier as we use many different manufacturers and presently own the majority of tooling and molds used for our products. Our Hong Kong subsidiary provides us with an Asian sourcing presence and the ability to oversee quality, electronic engineering and other issues that may arise during production. Generally, we buy finished goods from manufacturers, and thus do not directly procure raw materials for product manufacturing. Historically, we have not experienced any significant disruption of supply as a result of raw material shortage, but there is the possibility that shortages could occur in the future based on a variety of factors beyond our control. We have seen increases in the cost of certain raw materials, including cotton, steel and resin and negotiate with our suppliers as to adjustments in pricing due to such increased costs.
​
Asian-made goods are shipped on the water to our warehouses, which currently takes approximately six to eight weeks due to ongoing global supply chain challenges as compared to three to four weeks a year ago. We also utilize a direct import program, to reduce costs and shipping time to certain customers. We maintain inventory in warehouses located in the United States and Canada as well as a third-party logistics warehouse in China. Most of our customers pick up their goods at our warehouses. We also deliver shipments direct to customers for sales from our own website and our consumer replacements program as well as for other smaller retail partners that request such arrangements.
​
Sales and Marketing
​
Our products are largely marketed and sold through our own direct sales force. We also have certain sales representatives in North America and distributors that service customers internationally. We seek to expand our direct-to-consumer sales, which we believe will also increase overall brand awareness. Sales are recognized upon transfer of title to our customers and are made utilizing standard credit terms of approximately 60 days. We generally accept returns only for defective merchandise. We maintain a U.S.-based internal customer service department that responds to customer inquiries, investigates and resolves issues, and is available to assist customers and consumers during business hours.
Marketing, promotion and consumer engagement are key elements in the juvenile industry. Historically, a significant percentage of our promotional spending has been structured in coordination with large retail partners. We continue to focus our marketing efforts on growing brand awareness among our target consumer demographic, optimizing marketing investments, and executing an integrated marketing strategy. We believe an important component of our future growth is based on speaking to the right customer, with the right content, in the right channel, at the right time. We have implemented online marketing, social media, and digital analytics tools, which allow us to better measure the performance of our marketing activities, learn from our consumers, and receive valuable insights into industry and competitor activities.
​
Competition
​
The juvenile product industry has many participants, none of which has dominant market share, though certain companies may have disproportionate strength in specific product categories. We compete with a number of different companies in a variety of categories, although there is no single company that competes with us across all of our product categories. Our largest direct competitors are Tomy Company, Ltd., Dorel Industries, Inc., Regalo Baby®, Munchkin®, GB® (Goodbaby International Holdings, Ltd.), Graco® (a subsidiary of Newell Rubbermaid), Chicco®, Fisher-Price® (a subsidiary of Mattel, Inc.), and Aden & Anais®.
​
The primary method of competition in the industry consists of brand positioning, product innovation, quality, price, and timely distribution. Our competitive strengths include our ability to develop innovative new products, breadth of assortment, high consumer star ratings, our relationships with national retailers, and the quality and pricing of our products.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We rely on a combination of trademarks, patents, and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. Our current U.S. patents include various design features related to safety gates, playards, bath seats, bathers, and monitors with several other patents under review by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The issued U.S. patents expire at various times depending on the date of issuance during the next 18 years. In certain circumstances, we will partner with third parties to develop proprietary 

5




products. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
​
Customers
​
Sales to the Company’s top seven customers together comprised approximately 88% of our sales in fiscal 2021 and 87% of our sales in fiscal 2020. Of these customers, three generated more than 10% of sales for fiscal 2021: Amazon.com (38%), Walmart (24%), and Target (18%). In fiscal 2020, three customers generated more than 10% of sales: Amazon.com (33%), Walmart (28%), and Target (17%).
 ​
We have no long-term contracts with these customers, and as a result, our success depends heavily on our customers’ willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products.
​
Seasonality
​
We do experience some variations in seasonal demand for our products in our second and third quarters of each year. However, we expect to generate higher than average volumes for the initial shipment of new products which typically includes enough inventory to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer’s distribution center. The timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year and whether there are any mid-year product introductions.
​
Regulatory Matters
​
Each of our products is designed to comply with all applicable mandatory and voluntary safety standards. In the United States, these safety standards are promulgated by federal, state and independent agencies such as the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, ASTM, the Federal Communications Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and various states Attorney Generals and state regulatory agencies. All of our products are independently tested by third party laboratories accepted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to verify compliance to applicable safety standards. A similar approach is used to design and test products sold internationally.
​
Insurance
​
We carry product liability insurance that provides us with $15,000 coverage with a minimal deductible. We consult with our insurers to ascertain appropriate liability coverage for our product mix. We believe our current coverage is adequate for our existing business and will continue to evaluate our coverage in the future in line with our expanding sales and product breadth.
​
Employees
​
We believe that the development, attraction and retention of employees is an important factor to our Company’s success. We offer our employees a wide range of benefits, and to support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. As of January 1, 2022, we had 112 employees, 107 of whom were full time employees and 55 of whom worked in our Rhode Island headquarters. We also utilize temporary labor at our main leased warehouse and distribution center located in California.
