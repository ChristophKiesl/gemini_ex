Item 1.    Business
Overview of Embark
Embark develops technologically advanced autonomous driving software for the truck freight industry and offers a carefully constructed business model that is designed to provide the industry with a path to adopting autonomous driving. Specifically, Embark has developed a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) platform designed to interoperate with a broad range 
of truck OEM platforms, forgoing complicated and logistically challenging truck building or hardware manufacturing operations in favor of focusing on a superior driving technology. Embark’s business plan contemplates that if Embark were to achieve scale, truck fleets will be able to access Embark technology via a subscription software license selected as an option at the time they specify the build of new semi-trucks.
On March 1, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) approved a process to explore, review and evaluate a range of potential strategic alternatives, including, without limitation, exploring alternative uses of the Company’s assets to commercialize its technology, additional sources of financing, as well as potential dissolution or winding up of the Company and liquidation of its assets. To the extent Embark is unable to execute or identify strategic alternatives, its liquidity will be negatively impacted and may not be sufficient to fund its operations. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
In response to these conditions, on March 3, 2023, the Company announced a restructuring plan after an extensive review of its organization and programs and in response to current ongoing market headwinds. In connection with this restructuring plan, the Company will reduce its workforce by approximately 230 employees, which represents 70% of its headcount. No assurance can be given that the Company’s exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any change in strategy. To the extent Embark is unable to execute or identify strategic alternatives, the Board may explore potential alternatives including, without limitation, the potential dissolution or winding up of the Company and liquidation of its assets. As a result, management’s plan cannot be considered probable and thus does not alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Embark’s history as the industry’s longest running autonomous truck driving program in the U.S. is replete with technological firsts that include, but are not limited to:
•First coast-to-coast autonomous truck drive;
•First to reach 100,000 autonomous miles driven on public roads;
•First operational transfer point network for self-driving trucks;
•First autonomous trucking company to adopt an OEM-agnostic approach;
•First autonomous vehicle trucking software to handle work zone lane closures; 
•First autonomous vehicle trucking software to self-park; 
•First to complete on-road autonomous testing in winter conditions;
•First to complete a public demonstration of an autonomous truck being pulled over by law enforcement and participating in a routine traffic stop on a public highway; and
•First autonomous developer to handover trucks to a carrier, through the Truck Transfer Program (“TTP”), for operation within the carrier’s fleet with the carrier’s drivers.
Embark currently targets and evaluates all sub-segments of the growing truck freight market, which is segmented by, criteria such as type of goods transported, geographies covered and trailer type. Embark will continue to evaluate a variety of different segments within and adjacent to the truck freight industry.
Embark’s founding team includes roboticists and its broader team includes numerous computer scientists, many with advanced degrees and experience at other leading robotics and autonomous vehicle companies and academic programs.
Challenges Faced by The Truck Freight Industry
The truck freight market is under significant cost and capacity pressures including:
•Driver Shortages. Carriers in the U.S. are facing driver shortages, particularly on long haul routes, as a result of an aging workforce and truck drivers’ preference for local routes that permit them to remain close to home. The American Trucking Association reported a shortage of 78,000 truck drivers in 2022, which is expected to reach a shortage of 160,000 drivers by 2030. As a result of this shortage, thousands of trucks have the potential to be left “against the fences” at large carriers.
•Economics. The U.S. truck freight industry is largely fragmented and highly price competitive. As a result, the market tends to be characterized by operating margins for incumbent carriers that are typically below 10%. Labor 
costs in the U.S. are the largest component of the per mile cost structure, representing 44% of total per mile semi-truck operating costs in 2022, according to the American Transportation Research Institute. 
•Operational Safety. Operational safety remains a significant obstacle for carriers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), there were approximately 5,601 deaths in 2021 and 141,965 crashes causing injuries in 2020 that involved heavy trucks. In addition to loss of life, automotive accidents involving large trucks account for significant financial loss as a result of damaged and destroyed cargo.
•Evolving Consumer Demands. According to the American Trucking Association, freight volumes are expected to grow 25% between 2021 and 2032. In addition, the continued growth of e-commerce is driving expected delivery times down, requiring faster and more efficient delivery. 
•Environmental Sustainability. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) estimates that truck freight accounted for 26% of automotive and over 7% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. in 2020. Carriers and shippers are increasingly focused on reducing carbon emissions associated with fleet operations.
Embark’s Solutions to the Industry’s Challenges
The Embark team has focused their development efforts to date to in order to address the following challenges;
•Software Solution for Long Haul Trucking. Embark seeks to address driver shortages with a software license that can assist in the navigation of a carrier-owned and haulage contractor-owned, Embark-equipped OEM truck from its origin to destination. In the U.S. truck freight market, implementation of Embark’s software would be expected to improve human driver quality of life by allowing drivers to service primarily local routes with Embark technology used to service long-haul portions of existing freight networks operated by carrier partners.
•Compelling Economics For Nearly Any Carrier. Embark believes that its autonomous driving solution could provide compelling economics for carrier partners. Embark’s technology is designed in such a manner that if it is fully developed it should be able to work on a wide range of semi-trucks through its proprietary Embark Universal Interface (“EUI”) technology. This would mean that carriers could use the Embark technology to operate trucks for longer hours, with estimated annual revenue and profitability per truck meaningfully increased no matter what brand of trucks the carriers prefer.
•Improved Safety. A majority of all motor vehicle accidents are caused by human error. Autonomous driving directly addresses accidents involving large trucks that are attributable to human error. To date, Embark trucks have driven over 1.5 million “real world” miles without a U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) reportable safety incident.
•Improved Speed of Delivery. USDOT regulations limit the time humans can drive trucks to 11 hours of operation per day. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to dramatically increase daily driving time and improve delivery speed.
•Improved Fleet Utilization. Autonomous vehicles that may be operated continuously would allow carriers to “unlock” usage from their existing truck fleets during periods of the day that human drivers may not be able to drive. Increased utilization may permit carriers to own fewer trucks to serve the same demand, reducing their costs.
•Improved Sustainability. Autonomous driving may improve fuel efficiency due to better speed management, supporting carrier and shipper sustainability objectives.

Embark’s People and Values
Embark’s employees and its culture have been key to its success and Embark views its culture and values as major differentiators for its business outcomes.
Embark’s path to a more safe, efficient, and rewarding trucking industry is rooted in its core values:
•Prioritize Safety;
•Be Reliable;
•Simplify The Problem;
•Inspire Collegiality; and
•Win Together.
Prior to joining Embark, many of its employees had prior experience working for a wide variety of reputed technology organizations. 
Embark’s employees are at the center of its operating model and Embark has invested in building a strong relationship with its team. Embark continually strives to maintain a culture that promotes productivity, learning, development and positivity. Throughout its interview processes and as employees onboard, Embark stresses the importance for each employee to be entrepreneurial in shaping a positive culture at Embark and to make a conscious effort to create an environment of inclusion and belonging. Embark’s expectation is that its employees bring a positive presence to the team every day, and Embark has been successful in finding and building a team that believes in this vision.
Embark’s Business Model and Go-To-Market Strategy
Embark’s business model offers meaningful operational savings to carriers and shippers. To date, while not generating any revenue, Embark has completed hundreds of hauls with many major companies and has leveraged that experience into designing its business model and commercialization plans. Embark’s technology was developed with the intent that it would be available as a SaaS subscription on an OEM platform-agnostic basis, meaning that carriers and haulage contractors would be able to subscribe to the Embark software for any new vehicles from any truck brand in their fleets. Embark believes this model would deliver compelling benefits across the entire trucking ecosystem by:
•Improving economics and alleviating driver shortages for carriers and haulage contractors;
•Increasing fuel economy, reducing emissions, and improving reliability, sustainability and safety;
•Providing an attractive cost of entry to autonomous vehicle technology without disrupting shippers’, carriers’, or haulage contractors’ truck preferences or supply chains; and
•Permitting Embark to focus on its area of expertise—autonomous driving development—while the rest of the ecosystem can specialize on the areas they excel in, including logistics and manufacturing.
SaaS Focus
Upon commercialization of Embark’s technology, it was expected that carriers and private fleets, would pay a license fee for Embark’s software. The license fee was expected to be structured as a per-mile fee. In return, the Embark Driver was expected to offer the opportunity for carriers and private fleets to realize significant per-mile savings and for haulage contractors to realize significant savings per haul. As an example, U.S. carrier investment significantly outpaces the resources of any single AV trucking player and Embark estimates that the top 100 carriers spend over $17 billion on new trucks annually based on an assumed 25% annual fleet turnover and an average truck price of $150,000.
In addition, by partnering with carriers as a software provider rather than competing with them by running its own freight network, Embark was expected to be able to leverage the expertise of its carrier and haulage contractor partners while focusing on developing and maintaining state-of-the-art software.
Platform Agnostic Technology
Through EUI, Embark has designed a solution to address the reality, that most major carriers run mixed fleets. Embark estimates that nearly 90% of the top 25 U.S. carriers run fleets with trucks provided by at least two OEMs and 50% run fleets with trucks provided by at least three OEMs. Ultimately, OEMs source components from multiple suppliers and carriers make final selections with regard to truck specifications.
Embark has engaged with all four major U.S. OEMs for many years, monitoring each manufacturer’s progress toward the development of proprietary “drive-by-wire” platforms that permit trucks to be controlled using electronic—rather than mechanical—control components. Drive-by-wire is an important advancement that facilitates the adoption of software-controlled semi-trucks. In connection with these OEM efforts, Embark has developed the EUI with flexible interfaces that are easily configured to integrate with each OEMs drive-by-wire platform.
Phased Rollout of Multiple Onboarding Methods
Embark’s business model contemplated a phased rollout with deployment of its technology in two phases: (1) Phase 1 targeting the Sunbelt states, which see approximately 90 billion semi-truck miles annually, which is estimated based on the Freight Analysis Framework produced through a partnership between the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the Federal Highway Administration; and (2) Phase 2 targeting all of the lower 48 states, which see approximately 300 billion semi-truck miles annually. Embark’s coverage map includes the full set of locations to which Embark Driver equipped trucks are able to travel. Embark was expecting to add two types of locations to its U.S. coverage map, enabling two route models:
1.Truck stops, which act as ideal transfer points that can be used by all carriers; and
2.Highway-adjacent shipper locations, which would allow Embark Driver-enabled trucks to travel direct-to-customer.
With the transfer point model, Embark would be able to focus on highway operations—the middle-mile—while Embark’s carrier partners conduct the first and last-mile portions with human drivers. These points would be located at existing facilities (e.g., truck stops) to provide a Day 1 drop-in solution for customers. Embark pioneered the transfer point model in 2017, partnering with Frigidaire and Ryder to deliver shipments. Since 2017, Embark has refined operations, conducted regular shipments between Los Angeles and Phoenix on its research and development (“R&D”) truck fleet, and delivered Embark technology-equipped trucks to a carrier demonstrating proof of concept.
In conjunction with transfer points, Embark’s expected to offer direct-to-customer freight lanes for customers who already move a significant amount of freight on Embark’s network. Embark has conducted network assessments for twelve major carriers and Fortune 500 shippers spanning the retail, consumer packaged goods, and automotive verticals who are committed to making self-driving freight operations a reality. 
Offering the transfer point network and direct-to-customer freight lanes addresses the economic reality of truck freight. Last mile transfers are projected to be economical for carriers shipping on lanes over 300 miles, whereas direct-to-customer transfers are expected to be economical for lanes in excess of 100 miles.
Embark’s Technology
Embark’s technology solutions are designed to support the seamless integration of driverless trucks into existing carrier and haulage contractor fleets with the goal of alleviating the driver shortage and improving unit economics for ecosystem participants. Its technology stack consists of three critical components, including the Embark Driver, the EUI, and the Embark Guardian. Together, these products make for a comprehensive, performant, and reliable freight solution, from sourcing to driving and support. 
Products
Embark’s technology ecosystem is grounded in three key components: Embark Driver, EUI, and Guardian.
•Embark Driver — Automated driving system (ADS) software, intended to be licensed as a subscription, safely and reliably pilots a carrier-owned or haulage contractor-owned, Embark-equipped OEM truck between designated highway adjacent transfer points. The Embark Driver is a SaaS product that is continually improved from real world data using Embark’s active learning system, which automatically learns from the most relevant data that Embark-driven trucks encounter in the real world. The software was developed by Embark’s leading team of roboticists and machine learning engineers to have advanced prediction and planning capabilities, including an up to 60 second prediction horizon and the ability to simulate up to 1,200 scenarios involving the actions and interactions of the truck with road traffic. The Embark Driver software also utilizes proprietary Vision Map Fusion and scene understanding techniques that make it more capable of responding to real world driving conditions than systems that are reliant on mapping technology alone. These capabilities, amongst many others in Embark’s technology stack, facilitate a safe and efficient driving experience.
•Embark Universal Interface — A standardized package of self-driving hardware components and the flexible interfaces designed to enable easy integration of the Embark Driver software onto class-8 trucks from all major OEMs including PACCAR, Traton, Volvo, and Daimler Trucks. Embark understands that its carrier customers value the opportunity to source trucks from different vendors and Embark’s strategy is to provide a path for AV adoption across a diversified fleet. EUI achieves compatibility, reliability and safety through a two part design—the component package and the interface package:
▪The EUI component package includes a standardized set of sensors and computer systems so that the Embark Driver software can process road data from truck platforms with different characteristics in the same way. The component package consists of cameras, LiDARs, radars, GNSS, and IMUs, as well as the associated compute systems, which were selected following thorough testing procedures and analysis with the goal of achieving optimal performance and redundancy for a highly capable, safe, and reliable automated driving solution.
▪The EUI interface package consists of APIs that permit the Embark Driver software to interface with the EUI component package and the drive-by-wire system of any major OEM platform. By providing a standardized set of APIs, the Embark Driver software is truly “platform agnostic,” meaning it can control a diverse set of platforms, provided the platform can interoperate with the EUI interface package. This allows for direct communication to and control of any EUI-compatible truck’s steering, braking, and throttle actuators, as well as to the trucks’ telematics, power chassis, and HVAC.
•Embark Guardian — Embark Guardian is a fleet management solution designed to be used by fleet support personnel of Embark and Embark’s customers to ensure the safety and productivity of an Embark Driver-equipped fleet. Embark Guardian enables users to
◦Track historical fleet performance data 
◦Monitor fleet and individual truck health in real-time 
◦Orchestrate fleet activity via mission creation and dispatch functionality 
◦Provide remote vehicle assistance when required 
Embark Guardian enables the operational oversight required to effectively deploy and manage Embark Driver-equipped trucks into carrier fleets.
Features
In addition to its core technology components, Embark has developed proprietary technical features that support the Embark Driver. These include:
•Vision Map Fusion — Using proprietary techniques, Vision Map Fusion uses a non-linear optimization approach to fuse local data at the truck with global map geometry, enabling real-time map corrections. For example, Vision Map Fusion permits the truck to detect and react to road condition changes, such as work zones, in real time, even if the truck’s map data doesn’t show these conditions. Real-time map corrections to account for local conditions allow for improved accuracy and robustness of near field lane geometry estimation, while also unifying the corrected near field topology with the far field map to create a static scene used in downstream operations. This means that Embark’s self-driving system is less map reliant and more capable of handling the constantly changing road environment. The ability of Vision Map Fusion to update and correct map errors in real time can facilitate safer, more scalable and more efficient operations compared to alternative map-centric approaches.
•Active Learning — Embark’s Active Learning system uses real world situations to rapidly improve performance. The Active Learning system applies a proprietary cloud-based selection engine to uploaded fleet data. The selection engine identifies “edge cases” from the truck’s real world driving data involving driving, road, weather, and/or other conditions that provide rich learning opportunities for Embark Driver’s artificial intelligence so that these edge cases can be studied to improve the Driver capabilities. The Active Learning system operates by uniformly sampling and analyzing the driver data for road and driving characteristics identified by Embark’s learning model as most beneficial to improving the Driver software’s performance. With the most valuable data automatically identified, Embark focuses the labeling and training efforts in a way to provide the quickest, most effective feedback loop for the Embark Driver to improve performance.
•Interactive Planning with Data Driven Predictions — The Embark Driver employs intelligent, adaptive prediction techniques to generate the best plan for each moment after simulating numerous potential scenarios and applying a prediction engine that looks into many potential future outcomes. At present, the Embark planning engine is capable of simulating up to 1,200 scenarios per second, using this information to build an up to 60 second planning horizon in which it looks ahead to see many possible outcomes from each potential driving decision. Using these data driven analytical models, the Embark Driver is able to accurately predict the actions of other road users and predict the optimal behavior in challenging driving situations. This allows the system to understand and account for real world driving conditions, such as cut-ins or sudden stops by other vehicles, and otherwise drive safely in busy traffic conditions.
Embark’s Partners and Ecosystem
Embark operates in an ecosystem consisting of shippers, carriers, haulage contractors, OEMs, component part suppliers, and truck stop operators. Embark believes that its solutions provide meaningful benefits to all existing ecosystem players. Embark’s PDP prepares carriers to own and operate Embark autonomous trucks. In October 2021, Embark announced that carriers participating in Embark’s PDP have placed a combined 14,200 reservations for Embark-equipped autonomous trucks.
Carriers
Through its PDP, Embark has partnered with carriers to develop its offering and demonstrate proof of concept. To date, Embark has entered into non-binding agreements with ten carriers and shippers to demonstrate its ability to move freight on their existing networks. Through these relationships, Embark is able to leverage the decades-long truck freight expertise of its carrier partners in optimizing its autonomous vehicle technology and business model. Embark’s existing relationships with carriers also demonstrate to the rest of the market that a number of large carriers with significant fleets and operations have already recognized the potential value of adopting Embark Driver.
Embark estimates that these existing carrier partners operate approximately 46,000 trucks and purchase approximately 11,500 trucks annually. Embark believes that its current carriers reflect a tiny fraction of the overall demand for its technology and Embark is in discussions with other carriers representing 50% of the top 100 carriers measured by truck count, which represent a meaningfully larger addressable market.
Shippers
In addition to partnering with carriers, Embark has fostered relationships with shippers across industry verticals such as retail, e-commerce, CPG and automotive. These shippers form the transportation demand that carriers fulfill. Embark’s autonomous vehicle technology provides meaningful benefits to shippers such as a reduction in CO2 emissions, an increase in speed and an improvement in safety. Embark has already worked with over half a dozen carriers and Fortune 500 shippers to analyze their transportation networks at a lane level and develop tactical plans for transitioning existing freight volume from manually driven trucks to Embark autonomous trucks operated by partner carriers.
OEMs
Embark’s relationships with OEMs have allowed it to develop the EUI. Each of the four major truck OEMs for the U.S. market are in the process of developing drive-by-wire platforms.
Embark’s Competitive Strengths
Asset-Light SaaS Model is Durable and Scalable Across Large Addressable Market
Embark has designed an asset-light SaaS business model and intends to commercialize by licensing its software for a fee on a subscription basis to carriers, haulage contractors, and shippers. Outside of an R&D fleet, Embark does not intend to own or operate trucks, removing a significant potential capital expenditure. This allows Embark to focus on software development and allows its partners to focus on what they do best-maintaining and operating trucks and freight networks. Once a carrier, haulage contractor or shipper partner specifies the EUI on a truck purchased from a preferred OEM, Embark would directly license the Embark Driver and provide ongoing support through Embark Guardian.
Through the PDP, Embark has developed its offering alongside carriers and shippers, establishing itself as a trusted technology partner. Embark has entered into non-binding agreements with a number of key carriers and estimates that its existing carrier partners operate approximately 46,000 trucks and purchase approximately 11,500 trucks annually.
The market for truck freight is large and growing. Embark estimates that the total addressable market for autonomous trucking is approximately 300 billion miles annually in the U.S.
Collaborative Business Model Was Expected to Promote Regulatory and Industry Acceptance
By working with Tier 1s, OEMs, carriers and shippers, Embark has developed a deep understanding of the existing freight ecosystem. It is this knowledge that drove Embark’s decision to work with, instead of compete against, existing freight players. In this collaborative model, Embark defers to OEMs for the manufacture and sale of the trucks themselves, with carriers purchasing and operating the trucks and shippers buying capacity in a manner similar to today. This configuration leverages the logistical expertise of the carrier, allows the technology to scale more quickly through existing OEM-carrier-shipper relationships and enables Embark to focus on delivering a safe and reliable autonomous truck. By working within the current value chain structure, Embark leverages the public and regulator trust that OEMs, carriers and shippers have earned over decades of freight operations. Additionally, by creating value for existing players and eliminating concerns of disintermediation, Embark is able to create powerful industry allies who advocate for its success with other ecosystem participants.
Embark has a strong track record of regulatory collaboration. In 2018, Embark presented a novel approach to USDOT and FMCSA, suggesting a legal interpretation that allows for autonomous truck operation under existing rules. Embark believes that this approach provides a clear path for testing and deployment of ADS-equipped commercial vehicles, while preserving FMCSA’s authority to ensure public safety by regulating autonomous truck operation. Embark’s approach was broadly adopted in “Automated Vehicles 3.0” (“AV 3.0”), a USDOT guidance document issued in October 2018, and has since been reiterated in AV 4.0 (2019) and the USDOT AV Comprehensive Plan (2021). AV 3.0 represented the first time USDOT acknowledged that autonomous truck operation without a human driver is allowable, and that human-specific regulations would not apply.
In 2021, Embark signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Arizona Department of Transportation to share information and best practices related to autonomous truck navigation of highway work zones. In addition, Embark has engaged in discussions with state regulators and law enforcement agencies around the country on truck inspection procedures and has actively contributed to the passage of state legislation.
Embark also holds leadership roles in key industry associations, including service as Co-Chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce AV Working Group, Co-Chair of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group AV Working Group, and on the Board of Directors of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, the primary trade association representing Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicle developers. Embark is also the longest-serving autonomous trucking member of the American Trucking Associations and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance.
Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership
At Embark, Embark believes that leadership in environment, social and governance (“ESG”) issues are central to its mission. Embark has taken steps to address the environmental and social risks and opportunities of its operations and products.
Embark’s ESG initiatives are organized into three pillars, which contain focus areas for its attention and action:
•Environmental Pillar is focused on increasing fuel efficiency, reducing environmental impacts from Embark’s testing fleet (e.g. policies against idling, repurposing materials, waterless truck washing), and ensuring its data storage needs are powered sustainably.
•Social Pillar is focused on upholding its commitment to driver safety and improved driver working conditions, supporting an engaged, talented and diverse workforce, collaborating on research projects with universities and supporting charitable foundations.
•Governance Pillar is focused on integrating enterprise risk management oversight across Embark’s data security and driver safety initiatives and sustaining a commitment to ethical business conduct, integrity, and responsibility.
All of Embark’s actions and each of its ESG pillars are underpinned by its vision to build a world where consumers pay less for the things they need, drivers stay closer to the homes they cherish, and roads are safer for the people Embark love.

Competition
Embark is the longest-running self-driving truck program in the U.S., which provides a competitive advantage. There are several competitors that have an AV trucking solution, including TuSimple, Aurora Innovation, Kodiak Robotics, and Waymo. Of the aforementioned, TuSimple and Kodiak Robotics focus solely on the trucking market, whereas Aurora Innovation and Waymo are also developing a robotaxi solution. Embark differentiates itself having developed a technology stack that is not over-reliant on HD Maps, and instead focuses on its VMF technology. Also, Embark has developed EUI, which is a modular approach to hardware that allows the Embark Driver to work across multiple OEM Platforms. Lastly, Embark has an asset-light approach, and partners with a variety of constituents within the logistics and trucking ecosystem.
Some of Embark’s current and potential competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than Embark does. These competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development of their current and future technologies or the promotion and sale of their offerings, or to offer lower prices. Embark’s current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative or strategic relationships amongst themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and offerings.
Government Regulation
Embark’s public policy strategy is oriented around three goals:
•Ensure current Embark testing operations remain allowable under federal/state laws;
•Ensure future deployment of Embark driverless trucks is allowable under federal/state laws; and
•Mitigate any emergent political/policy risks that could affect Embark’s plans or business model.
Embark has crafted federal and state policy strategies that support these goals by leveraging key industry groups and other allies while solidifying Embark’s position as an industry leader. Embark is the longest- running self-driving truck program, and has been proactively engaged with government stakeholders nearly from its beginning, affording us long-standing relationships with both political leadership and career staff at key regulatory agencies. Embark has a track record of success in advocating on behalf of the industry, serving as a leading voice on state and federal policy and legislative issues. Embark intends to continue to invest in these efforts to maintain its leadership in the public policy arena.
Intellectual Property
Embark relies on a combination of intellectual property, primarily trade secrets and copyrights, to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. In addition, Embark relies on significant technical measures, including the fact that its software is maintained securely in a proprietary cloud environment and is not accessible by customers, component suppliers or competitors in its current development and scale-up phase. Employee devices are encrypted and closely protected, with administrative controls to remotely lock or wipe compromised devices, while at the same time revoking credentials for individual employees with access to its internal systems. In addition, Embark employs physical security measures and employment processes to maintain the security of its physical assets and the integrity of its trade secrets and copyrighted source code.
Embark also protects its proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Embark requires its employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements through which they agree to maintain confidentiality and, as applicable, agree to assign to Embark any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them for Embark. In addition, Embark enters into confidentiality agreements with its vendors, commercial partners and potential customers.
Embark has filed patent applications on certain key aspects of its proprietary software, and intends to pursue patent protection on certain key aspects of its technology as it transitions into its commercial phase and potential concerns about publication through patents become less acute. Currently Embark has been issued three U.S. patents and has 24 patent pending applications. Embark also pursues trademark protection and is the registered holder of several domain registrations.
