Overview 
 
XBiotech Inc. (“XBiotech” or the “Company) is a pre-market biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing True Human™ monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. True Human™ monoclonal antibodies are those which occur naturally in human beings—as opposed to being derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. We believe that naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be safer and more effective than their non-naturally occurring counterparts. While focused on bringing our lead product candidate to market, we also have developed a True Human™ pipeline and manufacturing system.
 
The majority of our efforts to date have been concentrated on developing our lead product candidate (also known as Xilonix™, MABp1, CA-18C3, CV-18C3, RA-18C3, and T2-18C3), a therapeutic antibody which specifically neutralizes interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 a). IL-1 a is a pro-inflammatory protein produced by leukocytes and other cells, where it plays a key role in inflammation. When unchecked, inflammation can contribute to the development and progression of a variety of different diseases, such as cancer, vascular disease, inflammatory skin disease, and diabetes. Our clinical studies have shown that blocking IL-1 a with our lead product candidate may have a beneficial effect on several diseases.
 
XBiotech has completed a Phase III study in Europe for the treatment of symptomatic colorectal cancer and is in the process of seeking marketing approval for our lead product candidate with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission in March 2016. Data from this Phase III study was published in The Lancet Oncology in January 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company received the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues (D180LOI) from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in connection with the Company's MAA. Clinical objections pertain primarily to benefit risk justification of the therapy and pharmacokinetics. Quality objections relate to qualification of the cell line used to produce the antibody and scaled down systems used to demonstrate robustness of the purification process as well as clarification of critical process controls. No objections remain regarding non-clinical aspects of the application.
 
In February 2017, the Company reported that it was granted an additional 30 days to submit its responses, extending the “clock-stop” period to March 22, 2017. This extension will allow sufficient time for the Company to complete a phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy subjects. Data from this study is intended to generate additional time points for PK analysis. This new PK data is intended to address relevant technical questions in the D180LOI and will be included in the Company’s response submission scheduled for March 22, 2017.
 
We received fast track designation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2012 to develop our lead product candidate as a treatment in the setting of metastatic colorectal cancer. The purpose of the fast track designation is to aid in the development, and expedite the review of drugs that have the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening disease. Enrollment was completed in late 2016 in a global double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer with overall survival as the primary endpoint.
 
In February 2017, the Company announced an affirmative outcome in the first interim analysis of this study, prospectively planned to occur at 50% of events (or 276 deaths). The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) performed the unblinded analysis and reported the study had no safety concerns and that indications of efficacy thus far were sufficient to recommend proceeding with the study without modification. Per the IDMC charter, this was the first of two interim efficacy analyses planned prior to the final analysis for overall survival. Survival analyses are also to be performed at 414 (75%) and 552 (100%) events at the respective stages. The study may be stopped for efficacy or futility at the second remaining interim analysis. This is also the case at the final analysis. Patients are otherwise followed for up to 18 months in order to determine overall survival. Based on a successful outcome of the FDA Phase III study, we will seek marketing approval for our lead product candidate with the FDA. Assuming such marketing approvals are obtained, we would distribute and sell this product through our own direct sales force or with a commercial partner.
 
We have also investigated our lead product candidate in clinical trials for other inflammatory conditions, including vascular disease (which led to fast track designation from the FDA to develop MABp1 as a therapy to reduce the need for re-intervention after treatment of peripheral vascular disease with angioplasty or other endovascular methods of treatment), type II diabetes, acne, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Data from each of these trials have been published in journals, with the exception of PG and HS. You can find a listing of these publications in the Summary of Clinical Findings to Date section of this document.

The Company completed enrollment in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled investigator-sponsored study for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), an inflammatory skin disease of such severity that is often treated through surgical removal of lesions. Twenty patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis that had progressed on standard therapies were enrolled in this study. Patients received MABp1 for 12 weeks and were then followed an additional 12 weeks to observe durability of treatment. Efficacy measures include assessment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) scores, a validated method for evaluating efficacy in HS patients, as well as quality of life assessment (as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index, (DLQI). The Company announced topline results from this study in February 2017, reporting a response rate in patients treated with MABp1 versus placebo of 60% vs 10%, respectively (p=0.035).
 
The Company has completed enrollment in its Phase I/II study evaluating dosing, safety and efficacy of its novel antibody, 514G3. 514G3 was developed from a healthy human donor with natural antibodies effective at neutralizing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and non-MRSA forms of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). 514G3 works to eliminate the principle immune evasion mechanism of the bacteria, allowing white blood cells to detect and destroy the bacteria. 514G3 has potential to treat all strains of MRSA and can be used without consideration for strain-specific resistance to various antibiotics. As a True Human monoclonal antibody, 514G3 is expected to be well tolerated without the side effects or risks of antibiotics, including the lack of risk of antibiotic resistance. This proprietary antibody received Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of all forms of S. aureus infections, including Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Top line results from this study are anticipated to be reported in first quarter 2017.
 
The Company is also developing other infectious disease therapies in its pipeline. XBiotech is using its True Human™ antibody technology to develop a first-in-class oral monoclonal antibody against clostridium difficile (C. diff). C. diff is a bacterium that can cause severe infections in the gastrointestinal tract. The infection is greatest for individuals who are being treated with antibiotics, those that are hospitalized or the elderly, particularly those in care facilities. Additionally, about 1 in 5 patients that become infected with C. diff experience a relapse and need to be re-treated. Recent outbreaks and increased virulence of C. diff suggest the urgent need to identify novel approaches to treat the disease. We have now shortlisted several anti-C. diff antibody candidates, which are now being tested in-vivo efficacy studies in C. diff infection models. The Company has shortlisted therapeutic antibody candidates against herpes zoster that will be tested in-vitro for efficacy in second quarter 2017. The isolation of candidate True human therapeutic antibodies against influenza are ongoing. 
 
Our True Human™ antibody therapeutics are developed in-house using our proprietary discovery platform. Identifying True Human™ antibodies useful for therapeutics may involve screening thousands of blood donors. To distinguish the clinically relevant antibodies from irrelevant background antibody molecules in donor bloods, we use our Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM™) technology. After we identify donors, we undertake the complex process of identifying the unique genes for producing the native antibody. Once the nucleic acid sequence is isolated, we are able to introduce these sequences into engineered production cells to manufacture large quantities of product candidate for use in humans. All patents and other intellectual property relating to both the composition of matter and methods of use of our True Human™ antibodies were developed internally by us. We manufacture these antibodies using a proprietary expression system licensed from Lonza Sales AG. The manufacturing process we have developed incorporates both proprietary and non-proprietary technology.
 
A key aspect of our manufacturing system involves the use of simple disposable bioreactor technology. Our manufacturing operations are currently located within our 86,000ft2 operations in Austin, Texas. Part of this includes a nearly 40,000 ft2 commercial manufacturing facility that the Company opened in August 2016. This new facility is located on XBiotech’s own 48-acre location just 15 minutes from the Texas capital in Austin. The building will provide a significant increase in the Company’s manufacturing and quality operations in anticipation of commercialization of the Company’s product pipeline. The new facility will increase about ten-fold the Company’s current production capacity. Completion of this building is the first phase in the Company’s plan to develop the 48-acre property to house additional production facilities, laboratories and administrative operations, creating a headquarter campus as the center of its global operations.

A Background on Therapeutic Antibodies 
 
A century ago scientists and physicians envisioned being able to custom design therapeutic agents that were highly specific for a single biological target. By selectively attacking disease while sparing healthy tissue, these “magic bullets” were thought to be ideal therapeutic agents. It was not until the early 1970’s, however, that this vision was realized when Kohler and Milstein developed a ground-breaking method for making target-specific monoclonal antibodies—a Nobel prize-winning endeavor. Using this new approach, numerous monoclonal antibody-based research, diagnostic, and therapeutic products have been developed.
 
Kohler and Milstein’s discovery was based on their knowledge that the immune system of higher animals produces antibodies as a method of protecting them from various, potentially damaging, agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and diseased cells. White blood cells, known as B cells, produce billions of different types of antibodies, each with a unique potential to selectively attach to and neutralize different disease targets. The vast array of possible treatments based on antibodies led to the development of what is now a major industry around the use of
 
True Human™ Antibodies 
 
White blood cells in the human body secrete billions of different antibodies that circulate through the blood to react and protect us from toxins, infectious agents or even other unwanted substances produced by our body. True Human™ antibodies, as the name implies, are simply those that are derived from a natural antibody identified from the blood of an individual.
 
To develop a True Human™ antibody therapy, donors are screened to find an individual that has a specific antibody that matches the desired characteristics needed to obtain the intended medical benefit. White blood cells from that individual are obtained, the unique gene that produced the antibody is cloned, and the genetic information is used to produce an exact replica of the antibody sequence. A True Human™ antibody is therefore not to be confused with other marketed antibodies, such as so-called fully human antibodies—where antibody reactivity is developed through gene sequence engineering in the laboratory.

Fundamental Science of True Human™ Antibodies 
 
To appreciate the background safety and tolerability of True Human™ antibodies, it is important to consider the fundamental biology of natural antibody production.
 
Billions of different white blood cells secrete billions of unique antibodies every day into circulation. The vast number of different antibodies (and cells that produce them), are essential to enable adequate molecular diversity to ward off all potential infectious or toxic threats. In other words, since antibodies act to bind and thereby neutralize unwanted agents, any given circulating antibody must be able to react with a potentially limitless number of existing or evolving disease entities.


The staggering number of different antibodies needed to achieve this level of preparedness, however, is a daunting concept from a genetics point of view. If an individual antibody gene was needed to encode each of a billion different antibodies, there would be 20,000 times as many genes needed just for antibodies as there would be needed to encode the rest of the entire human genome. Individual cells would need to be gigantic, and monumental resources would be required to make, copy and maintain all of the DNA. Clearly, the system of antibodies could not have evolved to protect us, had not an elegant solution emerged to deal with this genetic conundrum.
 
Thus, a hallmark of the immune physiology of all vertebrates (all have antibodies) is the ability to recombine and selectively mutate a relatively small number of gene segments to create a phenomenal and effectively unlimited number of antibody genes. By rearranging, recombining and mutating the genetic code, specialized white blood cells, or B lymphocytes, are able to create an unlimited array of antibody genes. The consequence of this genetic engineering, however, is that each antibody gene is unique to the individual B lymphocyte that created it—and no copy of the gene exists in the human germline. The only place to find a unique antibody gene is in the individual cells that created it.
 
The extraordinary process of gene rearrangement and mutation results in a multitude of unique B lymphocytes and consequently an incredibly diverse repertoire of antibodies in any given individual.
 
Elucidating the mechanisms behind the production of unique antibody genes must be considered one of the major achievements of medical research in the 20th century. Yet unfolding this mystery created another problem to solve: If antibodies were not produced from genes encoded in the human genome and the products of these genes were new to the body, why were these antibody molecules not recognized by the immune system as foreign substances—like any other foreign substance that they were intended to eradicate? How could the body distinguish the apparently “foreign” antibody molecules from the bona fide infectious intruders?
 
Unraveling the genetics of antibody production led to another major advance in medicine: the discovery of how an endless array of antibody proteins could be made in a way that individual molecules were always tolerated by the body.
 
In the early 1990s research began to demonstrate that the production of antibodies was not an unregulated process. Rather, it was learned that the antibodies produced by each and every B lymphocyte were subject to intense scrutiny. Studies showed that B lymphocytes which produced acceptable antibodies were stimulated to grow while those that produced “autoreactive” antibodies were not. B lymphocytes that produced “good” antibodies were stimulated to proliferate, and enabled to produce copious amounts of antibody in the event it was needed to ward off a harmful agent. B lymphocytes that rearranged genes to produce antibodies that were ineffective or were autoreactive were given signals that instructed them to engage in a process of programmed cell death. Thus B lymphocytes producing harmful or useless antibodies are simply killed off. This mechanism for creating antibody diversity on the one hand, while protecting the individual from a mass of unwanted or intolerable antibody molecules on the other, was as elegant as it was fundamental to the success of vertebrate immune physiology.
 
This process of “selection” has been elucidated in great detail. There can be no more important feature of immune physiology than the process of selection. Selection is a fundamental step to enable the body to produce an extremely diverse set of antibody molecules without, in the process, producing an array of novel molecules that cause harm.

Industry Context 
 
Until now each and every therapeutic antibody on the market has been derived from animals and/or through gene sequence modification in the laboratory to produce a desired antibody reactivity. Marketed antibodies to date, described as “fully human”, are not derived from human gene sequences that have undergone the crucial process of selection in a human.
 
Without exception, all marketed products to date that are described as “fully human”, are in fact engineered and are not selected based on natural tolerance in the human body. The use of the term fully human to describe these products has thus created considerable confusion. To our knowledge, there are at present no True Human™ antibodies manufactured using recombinant protein technology currently marketed. If successful in clinical development, our lead product candidate is expected to be the first True Human™ therapeutic antibody to be commercialized.
 
Platform Technology 
 
There are significant technical challenges in identifying and cloning genes for True Human™ antibodies. A key problem to overcome can be to first identify individuals with the desired antibody reactivity. This can involve screening hundreds of donors to enable the identification of a single, clinically relevant antibody—discovered from literally trillions of irrelevant background antibody molecules in the blood of donors. We screen human donors to find an individual who has in his or her blood a specific antibody that we believe will be protective against a certain disease. White blood cells from that individual can then be isolated, and the unique gene that produced the antibody obtained. We currently obtain blood donor samples through a Research and Collaboration Agreement with the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. See "Intellectual Property- Other Commercial Licenses."
 
Novel cloning technologies developed at XBiotech have enabled us to clone the crucial antibody gene sequences from these donors in order to reproduce a True Human™ antibody for use in clinical therapy. A True Human™ monoclonal antibody should therefore not be confused with other marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as those currently referred to as fully human antibodies.
 
Market Opportunity 
 
We have a number of indications in various stages of clinical or pre-clinical development with significant market opportunities. These include oncology, diabetes, dermatology and other inflammatory conditions, as well as infectious disease indications. At present, our therapy for colorectal cancer, in which we have completed one Phase III study and have another ongoing, is the most advanced.
Cancer Business and the Market for Colorectal Therapies 
 
The development of new therapies for the treatment of cancer continues to be a fundamental area of focus and growth in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry. Detailed and thorough analysis of the oncology business, including that for colorectal cancer, is available from a number of research specialists and other independent sources.
 
In brief, the three major regional markets for cancer drugs are the United States, EU5 (Germany, UK, Italy, France & Spain) and Japan, with sales from these regions representing close to two-thirds of the market share. The market for colorectal cancer drugs is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5%, to reach approximately $8.0 billion in annual sales by 2021 (per Datamonitor Healthcare).
 
An intense industry focus on developing new therapies for colorectal cancer is not surprising since this a highly prevalent form of cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, Surveillance Research 2015, nearly 130,000 men and women in the United States were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2015. This represents almost 8% of all forms of cancer that were diagnosed. In terms of mortality, as many as 50,000 people died from the disease in 2015 and many more were refractory to existing therapy.


Our lead therapeutic antibody is being evaluated as a monotherapy to treat advanced stages of CRC. If our lead product candidate proves successful in both its Phase III studies, it will have demonstrated the ability to not only increase survival of patients, but also to facilitate recovery and reduce debilitating symptoms of the disease. While the market for colorectal cancer drugs is competitive and dynamic, in the event marketing approval is established for our lead product candidate, we expect this therapy to be a highly valued and unique therapy in oncology, providing for broad utility in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.

Product Pipeline 
 
Our product development status for the fourth quarter of 2016 was as follows:
 


Competition 
 
The therapeutic antibody space is dynamic as there continues to be a highly active commercial pipeline of therapeutic antibodies globally, involving a complex array of development cycles as products reach the end of their patent life and as new candidate products proceed into pivotal studies and approach registration. There are numerous independent reviews on the subject in both trade journals and academic press (one such example being Reichert JM, Antibodies to watch in 2017 MAbs. 2017 Feb/Mar;9(2):167-181. Epub 2016 Dec 14).
 
We believe True Human™ therapeutic antibodies have important differentiating factors from other monoclonal antibodies currently marketed. The unique activity of our lead anti-cancer therapeutic is being tested for its ability to both improve well-being and extend life. If proven in our Phase III studies, we feel our lead product candidate will be highly differentiated in the market place for cancer therapeutics. However, regardless of the potential advantages or uniqueness of our lead product candidate in the market, we do expect these products to compete head-to-head with the numerous existing candidate antibody products in development, including emerging biosimilar therapeutic antibodies.



Current Clinical Activity 
 

European Registration Study Oncology 
 
XBiotech has completed a Phase III study in Europe for treatment of symptomatic CRC and is in the process of seeking marketing approval for our lead product candidate with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company continued its efforts to seek marketing approval for its lead product candidate in connection with the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The Company received the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues (D180LOI) in December 2016 and received a clock stop extension from the EMA, prompting a response submission deadline of February 2017. The Company received a second clock stop extension in February 2017 after a clarification meeting was held between XBiotech and the EMA. The EMA granted an additional 30 days to submit D180LOI responses to allow the Company sufficient time to conduct a PK study evaluating the antibody therapy’s half-life in healthy volunteers.

The MAA includes data from the completed, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase III registration study in Europe which evaluated XBiotech’s lead product candidate as an anticancer therapy in patients with symptomatic CRC. The results of this study were published in The Lancet Oncology in January 2017 in an article titled, “MABp1 as a Novel Antibody Treatment for Advanced Colorectal Cancer: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Study.”
 
In the double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III study, 309 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive Xilonix™ plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC. Study participants had failed all available chemotherapy and had metastatic disease with one or more symptoms of metabolic dysfunction and functional impairment (i.e., elevated systemic inflammation, unintentional weight loss, pain, fatigue, anorexia). Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) function status of only 1 or 2. Elderly patients (>70 years of age) were eligible as well, in contrast to many studies of anti-cancer therapies in advanced disease. The primary endpoint in the study was a composite measure of stable or increased lean body mass (as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)) and stability or improvement of two of three symptom measures of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (pain, fatigue, or anorexia) at week 8 compared with baseline measurements. Secondary endpoints evaluated paraneoplastic thrombocytosis and systemic inflammation.
US Registration Study Oncology 
 
Enrollment was recently completed in the global randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study evaluating the Company’s lead product candidate as a treatment for advanced CRC. The Phase III study is being conducted under Fast Track designation from the FDA and involves over 600 advanced cancer patients from various countries world wide.
 
In February 2017, the Company announced an affirmative outcome in the first interim analysis of this study, prospectively planned to occur at 50% of events (or 276 deaths). The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) performed the unblinded analysis and reported the study had no safety concerns and that indications of efficacy thus far were sufficient to recommend proceeding with the study without modification. Per the DMC charter, this was the first of two interim efficacy analyses planned prior to the final analysis for overall survival. Survival analyses are also to be performed at 414 (75%) and 552 (100%) events at the respective stages. The study may be stopped for efficacy or futility at the second remaining interim analysis. This is also the case at the final analysis. Patients are otherwise, followed for up to 18 months in order to determine overall survival.
 
The double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study is randomized 2:1 with patients receiving Xilonix™ or placebo plus best supportive care. Patients are required to have metastatic CRC, and are required to have failed regimens that include flouropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and Cetuximab or Panitumumab for patients with V-Ki-ras2Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation. Patients continue on the study until there is evidence of radiographic progression. The primary endpoint of this study is overall survival, with secondary endpoints including objective response rate, progression free survival, change in lean body mass as measured by DEXA, and patient reported quality of life using the validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life in cancer Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire). 


Phase II Study Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) 
 
A phase II open-label exploratory study to evaluate our lead product candidate for treatment of the rare skin disorder PG (IND # 112,459) has completed enrollment. PG is a chronic condition characterized by inflamed, non-healing skin ulcerations. The study is evaluating safety and efficacy of the therapy to facilitate wound healing and was conducted at 5 clinical trial sites in the United States. Primary endpoints of study involve clinicians’ and patients’ global assessment at day 28 from baseline. Patients who are found to be responding to therapy, but who have not yet experienced complete resolution of their lesion(s) after 28 days of therapy may participate in up to 3 additional 28-day cycles. Data from this study is anticipated to be announced soon.

Phase I/II Study for Staphylococcus aureus 
 
In December 2016, the Company completed enrollment in its randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I/II study evaluating dosing, safety and efficacy of the Company’s novel antibody therapy, 514G3. This proprietary antibody therapy has received Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of all forms of Staphylococcus aureus infections, including Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The Company reports that top-line findings from the 514G3 study should be reported in the first quarter of 2017.
 
Patients enrolled in the Phase II portion of the study were randomized to receive the highest dose of 514G3, as determined by the Phase I portion of the study, plus standard of care antibiotics vs. placebo plus antibiotics. Patients were treated in hospital settings at sites in the United States, Germany, Taiwan and Korea. In addition to safety and tolerability evaluation, the study includes efficacy measures, such as time to clearance of bacteremia (as measured by blood culture), duration of fever, serious adverse events, length of hospitalization and survival.  The randomized, blinded Phase II portion has enrolled 36 patients, with 24 of those patients randomized to receive 514G3.
 
Phase II Study for Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)
 
The Company completed enrollment in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled investigator-sponsored study for HS, an inflammatory skin disease of such severity that is often treated through surgical removal of lesions. Twenty patients with moderate to severe HS that had progressed on standard therapies were enrolled in this study. Patients received MABp1 for 12 weeks and were then followed for an additional 12 weeks to observe durability of treatment. Efficacy measures include assessment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) scores, a validated method for evaluating efficacy in HS patients, as well as quality of life assessment (as measured by DLQI. The Company announced topline results from this study in February 2017, reporting a response rate in patients treated with MABp1 versus placebo of 60% vs 10%, respectively (p=0.035).



Summary of Clinical Findings to Date
 
Safety 
 
Our lead product under development is derived from a natural human immune response. We expected that this would facilitate better tolerability when used as a therapeutic compared to humanized or “fully human” monoclonal antibodies. Antibody therapies are known to be associated with significant risk for infusion reactions, including serious anaphylactic reactions. We believe that these reactions are the result of using antibodies that were not derived from natural human immunity but rather had engineered specificities. Based on scientific principles of antibody physiology, a fundamentally important premise was that our True HumanTM antibody therapy should be safer and result in less infusion-related complications than engineered human antibodies when used in clinical studies.
 
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, even those so-called “fully human,” have been associated with infusion reactions. Comparably administration of our lead product candidate is associated with a reduced number of infusion related reactions.

Because the patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostics companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents owned and licensed by us, or any future patents, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products or ensure that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties. Furthermore, to the extent that any of our future products or methods are not patentable, that such products or methods infringe upon the patents of third parties, or that our patents or future patents fail to give us an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents, we will be adversely affected. We may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of the patents in court. A license may be unavailable on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming, and we may be unable to prevail in any such patent litigation or devote sufficient resources to even pursue such litigation.
