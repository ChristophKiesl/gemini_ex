General Description of Business
 
Ballantyne Strong, Inc. (“Ballantyne” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation established in 1932, is a holding company with the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Strong Technical Services, Inc., Strong/MDI Screen Systems, Inc. (“Strong/MDI”), Convergent Media Systems Corporation (“Convergent”), Strong Digital Media, LLC (“SDM”) and StrongVest Global Advisors, LLC (“StrongVest”). Ballantyne went public in 1995; our shares are traded on the NYSE American market under the symbol “BTN.” Our website is www.ballantynestrong.com.
 
The Company conducts its operations through three operating segments: Strong Entertainment (formerly known as Strong Cinema), Convergent and Strong Outdoor. The Strong Entertainment segment name change is to the name only and had no impact on our historical financial position, results of operations, cash flow or segment level results previously reported. The Company’s strategic plan contemplates a combination of:
 

● | Investing in the operations and growth of our existing businesses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evaluating opportunities to maximize value by monetizing investments in our existing businesses; and 
● | Investing in public companies, private companies or other areas. 

 
Management is focused on improving the operating performance of its three operating businesses in order to increase organic revenue and cash flow, with the intent of improving the ultimate valuation of those businesses. The Company may seek to sell a minority, majority or all of its existing businesses as part of its strategic plans. In addition, we may invest in other public companies or acquire other businesses, which may be within or outside of the Company’s existing markets.
 
Fundamental Global Investors, LLC (“Fundamental Global Investors”), the funds that it manages, its other affiliates, and the directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates together held approximately 42.1% of the Company’s outstanding stock as of March 1, 2020. In some cases, funds managed by Fundamental Global Investors may acquire positions in the same public companies as the Company. Fundamental Global Investors’ funds currently hold positions in PIH and Itasca (as defined below).

We provide high quality projection screens, technical support services and other related products and services to the cinema exhibition industry, theme parks and other entertainment-related markets. We also distribute and support third party products, including digital projectors, servers, library management systems, menu boards and sound systems.
Products and Services
 
Projection Screens and Support Systems — We are the largest supplier of premium large format projection screens to the cinema industry in North America. We have an exclusive relationship to supply large format screens to IMAX theaters and supply many of the other major cinema operators worldwide. We also manufacture innovative screen support structures custom built to adapt to virtually any venue requirement, with a unique self-standing modular construction that allows for easy assembly and adjustable size.
 
We also manufacture and distribute screens to theme parks, museums, and schools and for special events. Our Eclipse curvilinear screens are specially designed to provide maximum viewer engagement in media-based attractions and immersive projection environments. The solid surface minimizes light loss to maintain higher resolution at lower lumen output. Patented speaker panels allow selective placement of rear mounted speakers to ensure the audio derives from the source media on screen. Applications include interactive dark rides, 3D/4D theme park rides, flying theaters and motion simulators.

We believe that our screens are the highest quality in the industry providing the highest gain and other characteristics important to the exhibitor and its patrons. Our high quality is driven by our innovative manufacturing process, focus on quality control and our proprietary coatings. We believe we are the only major screen manufacturer that develops and produces its own proprietary coatings, which are critical to the overall quality, increased screen reflectivity and brightness and continued innovation of our screens.
 
Technical Services – We provide digital projection equipment installations and after-sale maintenance and network support services to the entertainment industry. Our field service technicians and our Network Operations Center (“NOC”) staff work hand in hand to resolve system and other issues for our customers. We service many of our customers under recurring revenue contracts providing for maintenance and repair to a wide range of installed digital equipment, providing our customers with a reliable turnkey outsourced service option. We also provide services to customers on a time and materials basis. Our NOC, staffed by software engineers and systems techs, operates 24/7/365 and monitors our customers’ networked equipment remotely, often providing proactive solutions to systems issues before they cause system failures.
 
Other Products – We distribute projectors, servers, audio systems and other third-party products including library management systems, lenses and lamps to customers in North and South America.
 
Markets
 
We sell our screen systems worldwide, with our primary markets being North America and Asia. Screen systems are primarily sold on a direct basis, although we also use third-party distributors and integrators in some markets.
 
We have non-exclusive distribution agreements with NEC and Barco that allow us to market digital projectors in North and South America.
 
We provide technical services in the United States. We market and sell our services both directly to theater owners and other entertainment-related markets and through dealers or Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) networks.
 
Competition

The markets for our other Strong Entertainment products and services are highly competitive, and the industry is fragmented. The primary competitive factors are price, product quality, features and customer support. Competition in the digital cinema equipment market includes other integrators and resellers. Manufacturers may also sell equipment directly to exhibitors, especially for large orders. Our primary competition for installation, after-sale maintenance, and NOC services is Christie Digital Systems USA, Inc., as well as smaller suppliers such as Tri-State Digital Services and Sonic Equipment Company, and in some cases internal resources of our larger entertainment customers.

Products and Services
 
Digital Signage as a Service (DSaaS) Platform – Our platform leverages internally developed and third-party software to automate the customer’s digital signage workflow, including from content creation, approval, storage and management, network deployment, monitoring, case management and incident resolution. Since it is cloud-based, it provides inherent scalability to enable customers to expand their network. The DSaaS platform supports a wide range of applications – all of which are managed through a web portal. New features and functionality are frequently added, both through the efforts of our in-house software development team and integration with an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party applications. We primarily use media players from BrightSign LLC in our DSaaS offerings. Our DSaaS offerings provide the Company with recurring revenue.
 
Content Creation – We provide creative services to digital signage clients that include media strategy, video and HTML content design and production, and data integration with customers’ business systems. Our creative services team develops custom content to support the branding and marketing initiatives of each client.

We utilize our DSaaS platform for the management and distribution of content. Content is prepared, scheduled and centrally distributed from our cloud infrastructure.
 
Network Operations Center – At Convergent’s NOC in Alpharetta, Georgia, a team of engineers and technology team provide continuous digital signage support for our customers’ networks to make sure all systems are functioning as planned.

Measurement and Analytics – We offer the tools and resources to measure the impact of digital signage solutions. We develop measurement criteria, establish benchmarks and identify control mechanisms to test the effectiveness of such solutions during proof of concept and full rollout scenarios.
 
Markets
 
Digital Signage – The digital signage market broadly defined includes all uses of digital display technologies and services to project promotional and informative content in the form of images, graphics, videos and creative advertising on digital displays. However, the Company is focused on certain segments of the market that use digital signage to (a) attract consumers into retail stores, banks and restaurants and attempt to influence their purchase decisions, and (b) engage employees with salient corporate messaging intended to positively influence their behavior. The primary sectors for these services include retail, hospitality, banking, healthcare, manufacturing and distribution.
 
Digital Out-of-Home – The DOOH advertising market is a subset of the overall out-of-home advertising market that includes in-store digital displays and interactive promotion kiosks. DOOH marketing campaigns consist of a network of digital displays that are centrally managed and target both mobile and captive customers outside the home. Some definitions of the DOOH market include digital signage used by companies to promote their goods and services. However, in this context, we define it as digital signage that is used for advertising any goods and services. We are primarily focused on pursuing DOOH communication opportunities within the hospitality and transportation markets.
 
Enterprise Video – The Enterprise Video market consists of organizations seeking to use video communications for employee training and town hall meetings. We are primarily focused on pursuing Enterprise Video opportunities within the government, banking, retail and corporate markets.
 
Competition
 
There are many players in our markets who have expertise in integration. Some of the key players include Diversified Media Group LLC and Stratacache, Inc. Competitive factors include range of services provided, reliability and performance characteristics, scalability, customer support and price.

Overview
 
We provide advertising services and experiential marketing services through Strong Outdoor. We started the business in early 2018 and provide out-of-home advertising services on taxicabs in New York City. We established SDM as the legal entity to conduct this business. We sell advertising to corporate media buyers and advertising agencies for display on vinyl printed signs. In May 2019, SDM transferred the 300 digital taxi tops it previously operated to Firefly (as defined below) in exchange for shares of Firefly.
 
In 2019, we expanded Strong Outdoor to include experiential marketing services and expanded Strong Outdoor’s services in other markets outside of New York City.

Traditional Taxi Top Advertising – Our 14” by 48” panels are fully illuminated and provide millions of daily cost-effective advertising impressions for our customers.
 
Experiential Marketing – We have expanded into experiential marketing, realizing the need for brands to not only reach consumers on a mass level but to create connections with consumers on a more personal level. We do this by utilizing taxi assets and doing stagings and free rides, but also creating opportunities by building out locations. We also intend to create touch points for brands in vehicles that are not taxis, such as glass trucks, and utilize projection for brands to make huge impact around festivals such as CES, SXSW, Coachella, etc.
 
Markets
 
Strong Outdoor currently operates in major U.S. metropolitan areas, including New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Diego, Austin and Boston. Currently, our largest market is New York City. Our customers include advertisers of feature films, television programs, Broadway shows and various consumer products and services.
Competition
 
There are over 13,000 yellow taxicabs in the New York City market. Other media and taxicab service companies provide taxi-top advertising services for taxicabs not subject to our agreement. We also compete with other forms of out-of-home advertising.

The Company holds investments in two public companies: approximately 17.2% of 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: PIH) (“PIH”), a diversified holding company of reinsurance and investment management businesses, and 32.3% of Itasca Capital Ltd.

Regulation
 
We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health requirements; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.
 
Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. There can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost.
