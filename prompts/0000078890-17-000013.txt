It succeeded to the business of a Virginia corporation in 1986 and was renamed The Brink’s Company in 2003.  Our headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia.

Brink’s operations are located throughout the world with 75% of our revenues earned outside the U.S. during 2016.  Brink’s Largest 5 Markets (U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil and Canada) represent 63% of consolidated revenues.  The following table presents a summary of revenues by segment in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Vision, Mission and Strategy
Our Vision
Our vision is to be the world’s premier provider of cash management, secure logistics and payment services.
Our Mission and Goal
Our goal is to create value by leveraging our brand, enhancing the customer experience, and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy is designed to achieve both organic and inorganic revenue growth while driving margins consistently higher. Our strategy has three pillars:

• | Accelerate profitable growth ("APG")


• | Close the gap with operational excellence ("CTG")


• | Introduce differentiated services ("IDS")

Accelerate profitable growth through:

• | growing High-Value Services


• | growing account share with existing customers


• | increasing focus on smaller financial institutions


• | penetrating large, unvended retail market


• | exploring core and adjacent acquisitions

We have opportunities to grow revenue in higher-margin lines of business such as CompuSafe® services and recyclers, money processing outsourcing, and Brink’s Global Services. Our plan calls for growing revenue with both large and small financial institutions, and increasing penetration of the large and underserved retail market. With a Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio under 1X, as of December 31, 2016, we also have the financial flexibility to complete accretive acquisitions in both core and adjacent markets.
Close the gap with operational excellence by:

• | leading our industry in safety and security


• | exceeding customer expectations


• | increasing operational productivity

We have already begun an aggressive drive to improve internal productivity, optimize cost and achieve industry-leading margins. 
Introduce differentiated services through:

• | leveraging uniform, best-in-class global technology base for logistics and operating systems


• | offering end-to-end cash supply chain managed services


• | launching a customer portal and value-added, fee-based services

The third component of our strategy is to introduce differentiated services to our customers by strengthening and leveraging our IT capabilities. Our IT strategy and systems will also drive improved service levels and operational efficiencies.

Services
We design customized services to meet the cash and valuables supply chain needs of our customers.  We enter into contracts with our customers to establish pricing and other terms. Cash-in-Transit and ATM contracts usually cover an initial term of at least one year and in many cases one to three years, and generally remain in effect thereafter until canceled by either party.  Contracts for Cash Management Services are typically longer.  Following are descriptions of our service offerings:
Core Services (53% of total revenues in 2016)
Cash-in-transit and ATM Services are core services we provide to customers throughout the world. We charge customers per service performed or based on the value of goods transported.  Revenues are affected by the level of economic activity in various markets as well as the volume of business for specific customers.  Core services generated approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in 2016.
Cash-in-Transit Services – Serving customers since 1859, our success in Cash-in-Transit is driven by a combination of rigorous security practices, high-quality customer service, risk management and logistics expertise.  Cash-in-Transit Services generally include the secure transportation of:

• | cash between businesses and financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions


• | cash, securities and other valuables between commercial banks, central banks and investment banking and brokerage firms


• | new currency, coins, bullion and precious metals for central banks and other customers

ATM Services – We manage 94,600 ATMs worldwide.  We provide customers who own and operate ATMs a variety of service options.  Basic ATM management services include cash replenishment and first and second line maintenance.  We also provide comprehensive services for ATM management through our Brink's Integrated Managed Services (“Brink’s IMS”) offering, which includes cash replenishment, replenishment forecasting, cash optimization, ATM remote monitoring, service call dispatching, transaction processing, installation services, and first and second line maintenance.
High-Value Services (40% of total revenues in 2016)
Our Core Services, combined with our brand and global infrastructure, provide a broad platform from which we offer additional High-Value Services, which generated approximately $1.2 billion of revenues in 2016.
Global Services -  Brink’s Global Services ("BGS") is the leading global provider of secure transport of highly-valued commodities including diamonds, jewelry, precious metals, securities, currency, high-tech devices, electronics and pharmaceuticals.  Our specialized diamond and jewelry operations have offices in the world’s major diamond and jewelry centers. Serving customers in more than 100 countries, BGS provides secure transportation services including pick-up, packaging, customs clearance, secure vault storage and inventory management. BGS uses a combination of armored vehicles and secure air and sea transportation.  
Cash Management Services - We offer a variety of Cash Management Services, depending on customers’ unique needs. These include:

• | money processing (e.g., counting, sorting, wrapping, checking condition of bills, etc.) and other cash management services


• | services related to deploying and servicing “intelligent” safes and safe control devices, including our patented CompuSafe® service 


• | integrated check and cash processing services (“Virtual Vault”)


• | check imaging services

Other cash management services include cashier balancing, counterfeit detection, account consolidation and electronic reporting.  Retail and bank customers use Brink’s to count and reconcile coins and currency, prepare bank deposit information and replenish coins and currency in specific denominations.
Brink's offers a fully integrated approach to managing customers' supply chain of cash.  These services include logistical support from point-of-sale through transport, vaulting, bank deposit and related credit reporting.  We also offer a variety of advanced technology applications including online cash tracking, cash inventory management, check imaging for real-time deposit processing, and a variety of other web-based tools that enable banks and other customers to reduce costs while improving service to their customers. We believe the quality and scope of our money processing and information systems differentiate our Cash Management Services from competitive offerings.
Brink’s CompuSafe® Service.  Brink’s CompuSafe® service provides an integrated, closed-loop system for preventing theft and managing cash.  We market CompuSafe® services to a variety of cash-intensive customers including convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, retail chains and entertainment venues.  In a majority of instances, once the specialized safe is installed, the customer’s employees deposit currency into the safe’s cassettes, which can only be removed by Brink’s personnel.  Upon removal, the cassettes are securely transported to a vault for processing where contents are verified and transferred for deposit.  Our CompuSafe® service features currency-recognition and counterfeit-detection technology, multi-language touch screens and an electronic interface between the point-of-sale, back-office systems and external banks.  Our electronic reporting interface with external banks enables customers to receive same-day credit on their cash balances, even if the cash remains on the customer’s premises. Recently, some customers have requested specialized safes permitting customer employees to remove money in a secure manner that was previously deposited in the safe cassettes to meet a current need. We have also implemented this capability.

Virtual Vault.  Virtual Vault services combine Cash-in-Transit Services, Cash Management Services, vaulting and electronic reporting technologies to help banks expand into new markets while minimizing investment in vaults and branch facilities.  In addition to providing secure storage, we process deposits, provide check imaging and reconciliation services, perform currency inventory management, process ATM replenishment orders and electronically transmit banking transactions.
Payment Services – We provide convenient payment services, including bill payment processing, mobile phone top-up, and Brink’s Money™ prepaid cards. 
Latin America. Bill payment processing services include bill payment acceptance and processing services on behalf of utility companies and other billers. Consumers can pay bills, top-up prepaid mobile phones and manage accounts at retail agent locations that we operate on behalf of utility companies, banks and a small number of leased payment locations. This service is offered at over 31,300 locations in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Panama.
United States.  We offer Brink’s Money™ general purpose reloadable prepaid cards and payroll cards to consumers and employers. Our general purpose reloadable cards are sold to consumers through our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts while our payroll cards are sold to employers who use them to pay employees electronically. Brink’s Money™ cards can be used at stores, restaurants, online retailers, and at ATMs worldwide. This product is targeted to the millions of unbanked and under-banked Americans looking for alternative financial products.  
Commercial Security Systems – We provide commercial security system services in designated markets in Europe.  Our security system design and installation services include alarms, motion detectors, closed-circuit televisions, digital video recorders, and access control systems, including card and biometric readers, electronic locks, and turnstiles.  We may also provide monitoring services after systems have been installed.
Other Security Services (7% of total revenues in 2016)
Guarding – We protect airports, offices, warehouses, stores, and public venues with or without electronic surveillance, access control, fire prevention and trained patrolling personnel. Other security services generated approximately $0.2 billion of revenues in 2016.
We offer security and guarding services in France, Luxembourg, Greece and Brazil.  A portion of this business involves long-term contracts related primarily to security services at airports and embassies.  Generally, guarding contracts are for a one-year period, and the majority of contracts are extended.
Industry and Competition
Brink’s competes with large multinational, regional and smaller companies throughout the world.  Our largest multinational competitors are G4S plc (U.K.); Loomis AB (Sweden); Prosegur, Compania de Seguridad, S.A. (Spain); and Garda World Security Corporation (Canada).
We believe the primary factors in attracting and retaining customers are security expertise, service quality, and price.  Our competitive advantages include:

• | brand name recognition


• | reputation for a high level of service and security


• | risk management and logistics expertise


• | global infrastructure and customer base


• | proven operational excellence, and


• | high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength

Although we face competitive pricing pressure in many markets, we resist competing on price alone.  We believe our high levels of service, security expertise and value-added solutions differentiate us from competitors.
Insurance Coverage
The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and manage the risks inherent in our business.  We purchase insurance coverage for losses in excess of what we consider to be prudent levels of self-insurance.  Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and certain other exclusions typical in such policies.
Insurance for security is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms.  Premiums fluctuate depending on market conditions.  The security loss experience of Brink’s and, to a limited extent, other armored carriers affects our premium rates.

Service Mark and Patents
BRINKS is a registered service mark in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.  The BRINKS mark, name and related marks are of material significance to our business.  We own patents for safes and related services, iDeposit and Daily Credit processes, including our integrated CompuSafe® service, which expire between 2017 and 2032.  These patents provide us with important advantages; however, we are not dependent on the existence of these patents.
We have licensed the Brink’s name to a limited number of companies, including a distributor of security products (padlocks, door hardware, etc.) offered for sale to consumers through major retail chains.
Government Regulation
Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations, equipment and financial responsibility.  Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to state regulation.  Operations outside of the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate.
Employee Relations
At December 31, 2016, our company had approximately 60,700 full-time and contract employees, including approximately 7,400 employees in the United States (of whom approximately 380 were classified as part-time employees) and approximately 53,300 employees outside the United States.  At December 31, 2016, Brink’s was a party to eleven collective bargaining agreements in the United States and Canada with various local unions covering approximately 1,600 employees.  The agreements have various expiration dates from 2017 to 2019.  Outside of the United States and Canada, approximately 56% of employees are represented by trade union organizations.  We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
Business Divestitures
Below is a summary of the significant businesses we disposed in the last three years.  See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these dispositions. The results of the operations below, which met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations as of or prior to December 31, 2014, have been excluded from continuing operations and are reported as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.  The sales of the Russian cash management business and the Irish guarding operations in 2015 as well as the shutdown of the remaining Ireland operations in 2016 did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. Operating results for these businesses are included in continuing operations for the current and prior periods. We continue to operate our Global Services business in most of these countries.
Cash-in-transit operations sold or shut down:

• | Australia (sold in October 2014)


• | Puerto Rico (shut down in November 2014)

• | We sold a noncontrolling interest in a CIT business based in Peru in 2014 for $60 million.


• | We sold our 70% ownership interest in a Russian cash management business in November 2015 and recognized a $5.9 million loss on the disposition. A significant part of the loss ($5.0 million) represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. 


• | We sold an Irish guarding operation in November 2015.


• | In September 2016, we shut down the remaining operations in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

• | We sold a German guarding operation in October 2016.

Reorganization and Restructuring
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced a reorganization and restructuring of Brink’s global organization (“2014 Reorganization and Restructuring”) to accelerate the execution of our strategy by reducing costs and providing for a more streamlined and centralized organization. As part of this program, we reduced our total workforce by approximately 1,700 positions. Severance costs of $21.8 million associated with these actions were recognized in 2014, with an additional $1.9 million in restructuring charges recognized in 2015. The restructuring saved annual direct costs of approximately $50 million in 2015 compared to 2014, excluding severance, lease termination and accelerated depreciation. The actions under this program were substantially completed by the end of 2015.
We initiated another global restructuring of our business in the third quarter of 2015 (“2015 Reorganization and Restructuring”), which included the recognition in 2015 of $11.6 million in costs related to employee severance, contract terminations and lease terminations. We recognized an additional $6.5 million in charges in 2016 related to this restructuring. The 2015 Reorganization and Restructuring reduced the global workforce by approximately 1,100 positions and resulted in approximately $20 million in 2016 cost savings. The actions under this program were substantially completed by the end of 2016, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $18 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions (“2016 Reorganization and Restructuring”). As a result of these actions, we recognized asset-related adjustments of $16.3 million, severance costs of $7.2 million, lease restructuring charges of $0.7 million, partially offset by a $6.1 million benefit related to the termination of a benefit program. Severance actions are expected to reduce our global workforce by 700 to 800 positions. We expect that the 2016 restructuring will result in $8 to $12 million in 2017 cost savings.
Executive Leadership and Board of Directors Restructuring
In January 2016, Brink’s entered into an agreement (the "Starboard Agreement") with Starboard Value LP and its affiliates ("Starboard"). As a result, our former Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Thomas C. Schievelbein, stepped down in May 2016, and two of the Company’s directors (including the Company’s independent lead director) retired from the Board. Pursuant to the Starboard Agreement, among other things, the Board appointed three new independent directors and delegated to the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee the responsibility to oversee the Board's process to search for a new CEO. On June 9, 2016, the Board appointed Douglas A. Pertz as the Company’s president and CEO and as a member of the Board. Joseph W. Dziedzic served as Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") from 2009 until he was replaced on July 14, 2016 when Brink's announced that Ronald J. Domanico had joined the Company as the new CFO. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized $1.8 million in costs related to the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring. We recognized an additional $4.3 million in charges, primarily severance costs, in 2016.
