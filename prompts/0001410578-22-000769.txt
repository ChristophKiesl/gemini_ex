ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General
Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in August 2019 to become the stock holding company for Cincinnati Federal in connection with the conversion of the former CF Mutual Holding Company from a mutual holding company to a stock holding company. Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is the successor to Cincinnati Bancorp (a Federal corporation) (“Old Cincinnati Bancorp”), the former stock holding company of Cincinnati Federal and majority-owned subsidiary of the former CF Mutual Holding Company. The conversion was completed effective January 22, 2020. In the conversion, Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. sold 1,652,960 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, and issued 1,322,665 shares of common stock in exchange for the shares of common stock of Old Cincinnati Bancorp owned by stockholders of Old Cincinnati Bancorp, other than CF Mutual Holding Company, as of the effective date of the conversion. As a result of the conversion, CF Mutual Holding Company and Old Cincinnati Bancorp have ceased to exist.
Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. conducts its business principally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cincinnati Federal.
The executive offices of Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. are located at 6581 Harrison Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45247, and the telephone number at that address is (513) 574-3025. Our website address is www.cincinnatifederal.com. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this annual report.
Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $251.5 million, total deposits of $204.5 million and total equity of $42.9 million. We recognized net income of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Cincinnati Federal is a federal savings bank headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Over the years, we have grown internally and we have also acquired a total of five mutual savings institutions, with our most recent acquisition occurring in 2018 with the acquisition of Kentucky Federal Savings and Loan Association effective October 12, 2018.
Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with borrowings and funds generated from operations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction and land loans. We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities and Federal Home Loan Bank stock. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts. We utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (the “FHLB-Cincinnati”) for asset/liability management purposes and for additional funding for our operations.
Cincinnati Federal also operates an active mortgage banking unit with thirteen mortgage loan officers, which originates loans both for sale into the secondary market and for retention in our portfolio. The revenue from gain on sales of loans was $8.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Cincinnati Federal is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by its primary federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Market Area
We conduct our operations from our main office and three branch offices in Cincinnati, Ohio (Cincinnati) and two branch offices in Northern Kentucky. We also operate a loan production office in Clermont County, Ohio. Hamilton County, Ohio represents our primary geographic market area for loans and deposits. Our business operations are conducted in the larger Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky metropolitan area which includes Warren, Butler and Clermont Counties in Ohio, Boone, Kenton and Campbell Counties in Kentucky, and Dearborn County, Indiana. We will, on occasion, make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary market. The local economy is diversified with services, trade and manufacturing employment being the most prominent employment sectors in Hamilton County. The employment base is diversified and there is no dependence on one area of the economy for continued employment. Major employers in the market include The Kroger Co., Catholic Healthcare Partners, The Procter & Gamble Company, the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, St. Elizabeth Healthcare, city and county governments, the University of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky University. Our future growth opportunities will be influenced by the growth and stability of the regional, state and national economies, other demographic trends and the competitive environment. Hamilton County and Cincinnati have generally experienced an increasing population since the 2010 census with the other counties in which we conduct business also experiencing population growth.
Competition
We face intense competition within our market area both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a concentration of financial institutions that include large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. We also face competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer and finance companies and, with respect to deposits, from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. As of June 30, 2021, based on the most recent available FDIC data, our market share of deposits represented 0.11% of FDIC-insured deposits in Hamilton County, ranking us 17th in deposit market share. This data does not include deposits held by credit unions.
Lending Activities
General. Our principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans and nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and construction and land loans. To a much lesser extent, we also originate commercial business loans and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to increase our focus on nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. We also originate for sale and sell the majority of the fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate with terms of greater than 10 years, on both a servicing-retained and servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining shorter-term fixed-rate and generally all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. Loans are sold primarily to FHLB-Cincinnati, Freddie Mac or to private sector third party buyers.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that Cincinnati Federal is permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of Cincinnati Federal’s unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral” or 30% for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2021, based on the 15% limitation, Cincinnati Federal’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $5.8 million. On the same date, Cincinnati Federal had no borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of this amount. At December 31, 2021, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was for approximately $4.6 million, secured by a nonresidential property, and was performing in accordance with its original terms on that date.
Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the application are verified through use of credit reports bank statements and tax returns. We generally follow underwriting procedures that are consistent with Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines.
Under our loan policy, the loan underwriter of an application is responsible for ensuring proposals and approval of any extensions of credit are in compliance with internal policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations, and for establishing and maintaining credit files and documentation sufficient to support the loan and to perfect any collateral position. Loans originated for sale may be approved by any loan underwriter, if the loan conforms to the underwriting guidelines established by the investor to whom the loan will be sold.
Loans to be held in our portfolio may not be approved solely by an underwriter, and generally require review and approval by our Chief Lending Officer, members of the loan committee or the board of directors. All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate loans, including total balances of outstanding loans and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. For one- to four-family owner-occupied real estate loans, our Chief Lending Officer, any two members of the loan committee or any one loan committee member and one underwriter are authorized to approve loans up to $647,200 in the aggregate.
For one- to four-family owner-occupied real estate, non-owner occupied one- to four-family owner-occupied real estate, commercial real estate, undeveloped lots or employee loans, any three members of the loan committee are authorized to approve up to $750,000 in the aggregate. The entire loan committee may approve loans up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate. For aggregate loans in excess of $1,000,000, approval of the board of directors is required.
For all other loans, our Chief Lending Officer or any two members of the loan committee are authorized to approve aggregate loans up to $50,000, with three loan committee members able to approve aggregate loans up to $250,000. As above, the approval of the full loan committee is required for loans up to $1,000,000 and approval of the board of directors is required for loans in excess of $1,000,000.
Generally, we require title insurance or abstracts on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan.
One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending. The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2021, we had $80.7 million of loans secured by one- to four-family real estate, representing 38.6% of our total loan portfolio. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021, the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans held in our portfolio due after December 31, 2022 were comprised of 49.7% fixed-rate loans, and 51.0% adjustable-rate loans.

Prior to 2010, we engaged in significant non-owner occupied one- to four-family real estate lending. Many of these loans were made to investors who owned a number of rental properties, and which did not provide sufficient rental cash flows to service the repayment of the loans. There is a greater credit risk inherent in non-owner occupied properties, than in owner occupied properties since, like nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans, the repayment of these loans may depend, in part, on the successful management of the property and/or the borrower’s ability to lease the property. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing these loans or the revenues derived from these properties which could affect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Beginning with the economic downturn that began in 2008, we experienced higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs in our non-owner occupied residential loan portfolio. Our management took steps to reduce our delinquent and non-performing assets in this portfolio, and to reduce this type of lending. See “—Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets” below. At December 31, 2021, we had $10.4 million of non-owner occupied residential loans.
We currently originate a small number of non-owner occupied residential loans. Non-owner occupied loans as a percentage of total loans was 5.0%. We impose strict underwriting guidelines in the origination of such loans, including a maximum number of loans to the same borrower, local residency, and no prior bankruptcies and/or foreclosures. Properties securing non-owner occupied loans must be within 50 miles of a Cincinnati Federal branch office. We also generally limit loans on non-owner occupied properties to borrowers with no more than ten total rental properties as a way to mitigate the risks involved in lending to professional property investors.
Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency for Fannie Mae. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We also offer FHA, VA and Rural Housing Development loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, VA and USDA guidelines. We use an underwriter with expertise in FHA/VA lending.
We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our owner-occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans to 85% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is lower. In addition, we may make one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less, if the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance. Non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are limited to an 80% loan-to-value ratio.
Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of up to 30 years, with non-owner occupied loans limited to a maximum term of 25 years. Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans generally have fixed rates for initial terms of three, five or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin. In recent years, this margin has been between 2.75% and 3.25% over the weekly average yield on U.S. treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan.
Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase, the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents. Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans do not adjust for a period ranging from three years up to ten years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.
We also originate home equity lines of credit and fixed-term home equity loans. See “—Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit.”

We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer “subprime loans” on one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., generally loans with credit scores less than 660), except for loans originated for sale in the secondary market.
We currently offer a special residential mortgage program with preferred loan terms to new and existing medical physicians. This program includes (i) preferred treatment of new physician income with regard to positions offered or recently begun and (ii) mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio up to 95% to 100% without the need to obtain mortgage insurance for loans up to $600,000. Doctors licensed for at least one year or self-employed for at least two years may receive mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 90% to 100% without the need to obtain mortgage insurance for loans up to $700,000 and 85% for loans greater than $700,000. The portfolio of loans originated under this program was $4.8 million as of December 31, 2021.
Nonresidential Real Estate and Multi-Family Lending. In recent years, we have increased our nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans. Our nonresidential real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, retail and mixed-use properties, and light industrial properties located in our primary market area. Our multi-family loans are secured primarily by apartment buildings. At December 31, 2021, we had $41.8 million in nonresidential real estate loans and $55.0 million in multi-family real estate loans, representing 20.0% and 26.3% of our total loan portfolio, respectively.
Most of our nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans have a maximum term of up to 25 years. The interest rates on nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans are generally fixed for an initial period of three, five or seven years and adjust annually thereafter based on the One Year Treasury Rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our nonresidential real estate loans is generally 75% while multi-family real estate loans have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. All loan-to-value ratios are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines. At December 31, 2021, our largest nonresidential real estate loan totaled $3.8 million and was secured by an industrial use facility. At that date, our largest multi-family real estate loan totaled $3.4 million and was secured by an apartment building. At December 31, 2021, both of these loans were performing in accordance with their original terms. Set forth below is information regarding our nonresidential real estate loans at December 31, 2021.

We consider a number of factors in originating nonresidential and multi-family real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All nonresidential real estate and multi-family loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of nonresidential and multi-family real estate borrowers.

Loans secured by nonresidential and multi-family real estate generally are larger than one- to four-family residential loans and involve greater credit risk. Nonresidential real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Repayment of nonresidential real estate loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by multi-family residential real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. If the cash flow from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed), the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate. At December 31, 2021, we had no non-performing nonresidential or multifamily real estate loans.
Construction Lending and Land Loans. We make construction loans to individuals for the construction of their primary residences and, to a limited extent, loans to builders and commercial borrowers. We also make a limited amount of land loans to complement our construction lending activities, as such loans are generally secured by lots that will be used for residential development. Land loans also include loans secured by land purchased for investment purposes. At December 31, 2021, our construction loans, including land loans, totaled $19.4 million, representing 9.3% of our total loan portfolio.
Loans to individuals for the construction of their residences are typically originated as construction/permanent loans, with a construction phase for up to 18 months. Upon completion of the construction phase, the loan automatically becomes a permanent loan. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential loans offered by us. During the construction phase, the borrower pays interest only. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of owner-occupied single-family construction loans is generally 80%, or higher if mortgage insurance is obtained. Residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating permanent residential loans. Land loans are generally offered for terms of up to 5 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of land loans is 65% for developed lots and 50% for undeveloped land loans.
At December 31, 2021, our largest outstanding residential construction loan was for $1.2 million of which $142,000 was outstanding. This loan was performing according to its original terms at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, there were no residential construction loans that were 60 days or more delinquent.
Loans to builders for the construction of pre-sold and market (not pre-sold) homes typically run for up to 24 months. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to one- to four-family residential loans offered by us. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of pre-sold builder construction loans is generally 80%, and this ratio is reduced to 65% on market homes. Construction loans to builders require that financial statements and tax returns be supplied and reviewed annually. Additionally, we limit construction loans to builders, to no more than two loans on market homes in one development at a time, or no more than one loan per builder at a time.
Loans for the construction of nonresidential or multi-family properties typically run for up to 18 months. These construction loans have rates and terms comparable to nonresidential real estate loans offered by us. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of nonresidential or multi-family construction loans is generally 75%. Nonresidential real estate construction loans also have a 50% pre-leasing requirement. No such requirement is placed on multi-family construction loans.
At December 31, 2021, our largest outstanding nonresidential or multi-family construction loan was $2.1 million of which $721,000 was outstanding. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at December 31, 2021. 
The application process for a construction loan includes a submission to Cincinnati Federal of accurate plans, specifications and costs of the project to be constructed or developed. These items are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property. Loans are based on the lesser of current appraised value and/or the cost of construction (land plus building). Our construction loan agreements generally provide that loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses.

Construction and land lending generally are made for relatively short terms. However, to the extent our construction loans are not made to owner-occupants of single-family homes, they are more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and the concentration of credit with a limited number of borrowers. Further, the nature of these loans is such that they are more difficult to evaluate and monitor. Our risk of loss on a construction or land loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property’s value upon completion of the project and the estimated cost (including interest) of the project. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project with a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment and/or the possibility of having to make substantial investments to complete and sell the project. Because defaults in repayment may not occur during the construction period, it may be difficult to identify problem loans at an early stage.
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, which are generally made for owner-occupied homes, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residences. We generally offer these loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio (including senior liens on the collateral property) of 90% if the first mortgage is originated by Cincinnati Federal and 85% if the first mortgage is not originated by Cincinnati Federal. We currently offer home equity lines of credit for a period of ten years, and generally at rates tied to the prevailing prime interest rate. We also offer home equity lines of credit on non-owner occupied properties, where the first mortgage is also originated by us, with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50% for a maximum term of two years. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten in the same manner as our one- to four-family residential loans. At December 31, 2021, we had $11.4 million of home equity lines of credit and $1.9 million of fixed-term home equity loans, representing 5.5% and 0.9% of our total loan portfolio, respectively. At December 31, 2021, we had no home equity loans and lines of credit that were 30 days or more delinquent.
Home equity lines of credit and fixed-term home equity loans have greater risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by first mortgages. Our interest is generally subordinated to the interest of the institution holding the first mortgage. Even where we hold the first mortgage, we face the risk that the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and costs of foreclosure and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers.
Commercial Business Loans. We have generally conducted very limited commercial business lending. We participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and originated $634,000 in such loans. All PPP loans have been repaid in full. The board of directors has also authorized management to purchase up to $500,000 in commercial business loans from an unaffiliated commercial lender specializing in loans to physicians and other professionals in the medical field. These are installment loans amortizing over seven years and carry higher interest rates than traditional residential loans. These loans may be secured by liens on non-real estate business assets. These loans are often used for working capital, debt consolidation, equipment and other general business purposes. The loans to be purchased must be reviewed and found to be consistent with our loan policy and underwriting guidelines. As of December 31, 2020, we had acquired such loans in the aggregate amount of $22,700. At December 31, 2021, the loans were performing in accordance with their original terms. 
Consumer Lending. Our consumer lending apart from home equity loans and lines of credit has been limited. At December 31, 2021, we had $349,000 of consumer loans outstanding, representing approximately 0.2% of our total loan portfolio.
Originations, Purchases and Sales of Loans
Lending activities are conducted primarily by our salaried loan personnel operating at our main and branch office locations and by our loan officers. All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans. Our ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by current and expected future levels of market interest rates. We originate real estate and other loans through our loan officers, marketing efforts, our customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys.

11



Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, we originate for sale and sell the majority of the fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate with terms of greater than 10 years, on a combination of servicing-retained and servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while generally retaining shorter-term fixed-rate and all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. Additionally, we consider the current interest rate environment in making decisions as to whether to hold the mortgage loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. At December 31, 2021, we had $8.1 million in loans held for sale.
From time to time, we may purchase or sell participation interests in loans. We underwrite our participation portion of the loan according to our own underwriting criteria and procedures. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $3.6 million and $4.2 million in loan participation interests that we purchased. At those dates, we had $2.4 million and $2.1 million in loan participation interests sold.
Historically, we generally do not purchase whole loans or loan participations from third parties to supplement our loan production. However, we have purchased loans from a commercial lender specializing in loans to physicians and other professionals in the medical field. We may purchase additional loans from that lender in the future. See “—Commercial Business Loans.”
We generally sell our loans without recourse, except for customary representations and warranties provided in sales transactions. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. We retain a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans we service as consideration for our servicing activities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we sold $272.9 million and $291.4 million of residential loans, respectively, of mortgage loans. Some of the mortgage loans were sold on a servicing-released basis, and we retained servicing on certain of these loans. At December 31, 2021, we serviced $281.9 million of fixed-rate and adjustable, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originated and sold in the secondary market.
Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
Delinquency Procedures. When a loan payment becomes 20 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, we mail a “right to cure” letter to the borrower and any co-makers and endorsers. If a loan payment becomes 90 days past due (or a borrower misses three consecutive payments, whichever occurs first), we send a demand letter and generally cease accruing interest. It is our policy to institute legal procedures for collection or foreclosure when a loan becomes 120 days past due, unless management determines that it is in the best interest of Cincinnati Federal to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. From time to time we may accept deeds in lieu of foreclosure.
When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as real estate owned. The real estate owned is recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense of the current period. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
In connection with the filing of our periodic reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.

​
Non-Performing Assets. We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans are placed on non-accrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on non-accrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until the loan qualifies for return to accrual. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, and future payments are reasonably assured. Loans are moved to non-accrual status in accordance with our policy, which is typically after 90 days of non-payment.

The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets and troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Troubled debt restructurings include loans for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven, or loans modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates.

Except as disclosed in the foregoing tables, other than $165,000 and $251,000 of loans designated as substandard, there were no other loans at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, that are not already disclosed where there is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused us serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. We occasionally modify loans to help a borrower stay current on his or her loan and to avoid foreclosure. We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in our best interest and increases the likelihood that we can collect the remaining principal balance. We may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates (which may be at below market rates), to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. At December 31, 2021, we had loans totaling $990,000 that were classified as troubled debt restructurings.
Allowance for Loan Losses
Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the amount considered necessary to reflect probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.
Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements: (1) specific allowances for identified impaired loans; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.
We identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans, and other loans about which management may have concerns about collectability. For individually reviewed loans, the borrower’s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan as well as the shortfall in collateral value could result in our charging off the loan or the portion of the loan that was impaired.

16



Among other factors, we consider current general economic conditions, including current housing price depreciation, in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses for our residential real estate portfolio. We use evidence obtained from our own loan portfolio as well as published housing data on our local markets from third party sources we believe to be reliable as a basis for assumptions about the impact of housing depreciation.
Substantially all of our loans are secured by collateral. Loans 90 days past due and other classified loans are evaluated for impairment and general or specific allowances are established. Typically for a nonperforming real estate loan in the process of collection, the value of the underlying collateral is estimated using either the original independent appraisal, adjusted for current economic conditions and other factors, or a new independent appraisal, or evaluation and related general or specific allowances for loan losses are adjusted on a quarterly basis. If a nonperforming real estate loan is in the process of foreclosure and/or there are serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, and there is uncertainty about the value of the underlying collateral, we will order a new independent appraisal or evaluation if it has not already been obtained. Any shortfall would result in immediately charging off the portion of the loan that was impaired.
Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans. We establish a specific allowance when loans are determined to be impaired. Loss is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling expenses. Factors in identifying a specific problem loan include: (1) the strength of the customer’s personal or business cash flows; (2) the availability of other sources of repayment; (3) the amount due or past due; (4) the type and value of collateral; (5) the strength of our collateral position; (6) the estimated cost to sell the collateral; and (7) the borrower’s effort to cure the delinquency. In addition, for loans secured by real estate, we consider the extent of any past due and unpaid property taxes applicable to the property serving as collateral on the mortgage.
General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. We establish a general allowance for loans that are not classified as impaired to recognize the probable incurred losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, has not been allocated to particular problem assets. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. The allowance may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are re-evaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.
As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The OCC may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Nonperforming loans decreased from $174,000 at December 31, 2020 to $120,000 at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.97% of total loans and 961.49% of nonperforming loans. The allowance for loan losses was $1.7 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Bank had no loan charge-offs during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, may request us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Investment Activities
General. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day, cyclical and long-term liquidity needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk within the parameters of our interest rate risk policy, and to generate a dependable flow of earnings within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Subject to loan demand and our interest rate risk analysis, we will increase the balance of our investment securities portfolio when we have excess liquidity.
Our investment policy was adopted, and is reviewed annually, by the board of directors. All investment decisions require the approval of at least three senior management members, one of which shall be the President or Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio which is reviewed at least monthly by the Bank’s asset-liability committee and the board of directors.

Our current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in United States Treasury securities; securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies or government sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; corporate bonds and obligations; debt securities of state and municipalities; commercial paper; certificates of deposit in other financial institutions, and bank-owned life insurance.
At December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio consisted of securities and obligations issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2021, we owned $4,149,300 of FHLB-Cincinnati stock. As a member of FHLB-Cincinnati, we are required to purchase stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati, which stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities.
Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2021, we had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $7.9 million, which constituted our entire securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multifamily mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as Cincinnati Federal. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of our mortgage-backed securities are backed by either Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or GNMA, which are government-sponsored enterprises.
Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.

The weighted average yield is based on the coupon rate of the security adjusted for any premium or discount when acquired. There are no tax- exempt securities in the investment portfolio.
Sources of Funds
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also may use borrowings, primarily FHLB-Cincinnati advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We do not accept brokered deposits, although we have the authority to do so.
We participate in the National CD Rateline Program as a wholesale source for certificates of deposit to supplement deposits generated through our retail banking operations. The Rateline Program provides an internet based listing service which connects financial institutions such as Cincinnati Federal with other financial institutions for jumbo certificates of deposit. Deposits obtained through the Rateline Program are not considered to be brokered deposits. At December 31, 2021, approximately $40.9 million of our certificates of deposit, representing 20.0% of our total deposits, had been obtained through the Rateline Program. At December 31, 2021, these certificates of deposit had an average term to maturity of eighteen months. Early withdrawal of these deposits is not permitted, which makes these accounts a more stable source of funds.
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. We rely upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers, and the favorable image of Cincinnati Federal in the community to attract and retain deposits. We recently implemented a fully functional electronic banking platform, including mobile app and on-line bill pay, as a service to our deposit customers.
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. Our ability to gather deposits is affected by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products.
The following table sets forth the distribution of our average total deposit accounts, by account type, for the periods indicated.

The total amount of uninsured deposits (deposit accounts exceeding the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit) was $1,083,000 and $1,834,000 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Borrowings. We may obtain advances from the FHLB-Cincinnati by pledging as security our capital stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati and certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2021, we had no FHLB-Cincinnati advances. In addition to funding portfolio loans, we sometimes use FHLB-Cincinnati advances for short-term funding needs arising from our mortgage-banking activities.
In addition to the availability of FHLB-Cincinnati advances we also have a total of $11.5 million in lines of credit available from three commercial banks. No amount was outstanding on these lines of credit at December 31, 2021.
Employees and Human Capital
We believe that the success of a business is largely due to the quality of its employees, the development of each employee’s full potential, and the Company’s ability to provide timely and satisfying rewards. We encourage and support development of our employees and, whenever possible, strive to fill vacancies from within. We invest in learning and development including tuition reimbursement for courses, degree programs and fees for certifications. As of December 31, 2021, we had 73 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.
Subsidiary Activities
Cincinnati Federal is the only subsidiary of Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. Cincinnati Federal Investment Services, LLC, is the sole subsidiary of Cincinnati Federal and is currently inactive.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
General
As a federal savings bank, Cincinnati Federal is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Cincinnati Federal may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Deposit Insurance Fund. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. Cincinnati Federal also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

22



Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings are inherently subjective and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Cincinnati Federal or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.
In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.
As a savings and loan holding company, Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. and Cincinnati Federal.
Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Cincinnati Federal and Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Cincinnati Federal and Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc.
Federal Banking Regulation
Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Cincinnati Federal may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. Cincinnati Federal may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Cincinnati Federal, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.

23



In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As fully implemented on January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer requirement is 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
At December 31, 2021, Cincinnati Federal’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. At December 31, 2021, Cincinnati Federal was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings bank, Cincinnati Federal must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, Cincinnati Federal must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings bank, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank’s business.
Cincinnati Federal also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This test generally requires a savings bank to have at least 75% of its deposits held by the public and earn at least 25% of its income from loans and U.S. government obligations. Alternatively, a savings bank can satisfy this test by maintaining at least 60% of its assets in cash, real estate loans and U.S. Government or state obligations.
A savings bank that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2021, Cincinnati Federal satisfied the QTL test.
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings bank’s capital account. A federal savings bank must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if:

● | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank’s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




● | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings, generally due to an unsatisfactory CAMELS rating or being subject to a cease and desist order or formal written agreement that requires action to improve the institution’s financial condition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Cincinnati Federal, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if:

● | the federal savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings bank also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to publicly disclose their rating. Cincinnati Federal received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with, an insured depository institution such as Cincinnati Federal. Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is an affiliate of Cincinnati Federal because of its control of Cincinnati Federal. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.

25



Cincinnati Federal’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:

● | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Cincinnati Federal’s capital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Cincinnati Federal’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings banks and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings bank. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings bank. If such action is not taken, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to take the action under specified circumstances.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, recent amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state.

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to a regulatory order to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, ceasing receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismissal of directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
At December 31, 2021, Cincinnati Federal met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits at Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured financial institutions such as Cincinnati Federal. Deposit accounts in Cincinnati Federal are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates are based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Institutions deemed to be less risky pay lower rates while institutions deemed riskier pay higher rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 1/2 to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s deposits.

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was required to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that the ratio had declined to 1.30% at September 30, 2020 due largely to consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDIC adopted a plan to restore the fund to the 1.35% ratio within eight years but did not change its assessment schedule.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Cincinnati Federal. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
Privacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that Cincinnati Federal disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Cincinnati Federal is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Cincinnati Federal currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.
USA PATRIOT Act. Cincinnati Federal is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on financial institutions, such as enhanced recordkeeping and customer identification requirements.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Other Regulations

Federal Reserve System
The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2022, the Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $32.4 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 0.0% and the amounts greater than $32.4 million and up to $640.6 million require a 10% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $32.4 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Cincinnati Federal was in compliance with these requirements at December 31, 2021. However, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios on all net transaction accounts to zero percent, eliminating reserve requirements for all depository institutions, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
Cincinnati Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Cincinnati Federal was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2020. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Cincinnati Federal reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati stock. At December 31, 2021, no impairment had been recognized.
Holding Company Regulation
Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Cincinnati Federal.
As a savings and loan holding company, Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc.’s activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies (if Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. makes an election to be treated as a financial holding company and meets the other requirements to be a financial holding company) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. has no present intention to make an election to be treated as a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. Multiple savings and loan holding companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by federal regulation, including activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act.

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository institution not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. A savings and loan holding company may not acquire a savings institution in another state and hold the target institution as a separate subsidiary unless it is a supervisory acquisition or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies.
The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, savings and loan holding companies of under $3 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise in particular cases.
The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” doctrine that require holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Federal Securities Laws
Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the conversion and stock offering. Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.

Change in Control Regulations
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, a federal statute, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc., unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Cincinnati Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “savings and loan holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
