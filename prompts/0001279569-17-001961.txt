General Business
 
We are pre-dominantly engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on uranium projects located in the United States and Paraguay. We utilize in-situ recovery (“ISR”) mining where possible which we believe, when compared to conventional open pit or underground mining, requires lower capital and operating expenditures with a shorter lead time to extraction and a reduced impact on the environment. We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and/or underground mining techniques. We have one uranium mine located in the State of Texas, the Palangana Mine, which utilizes ISR mining and commenced extraction of uranium oxide (“U3O8”), or yellowcake, in November 2010. We have one uranium processing facility located in the State of Texas, the Hobson Processing Facility, which processes material from the Palangana Mine into drums of U3O8, our only sales product and source of revenue, for shipping to a third-party storage and sales facility. Since commencement of uranium extraction from the Palangana Mine in November 2010 to July 31, 2017, the Hobson Processing Facility has processed 580,100 pounds of U3O8. At July 31, 2017, we had no uranium supply or “off-take” agreements in place.
 
Our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our regional operating strategy in the State of Texas, specifically the South Texas Uranium Belt where we utilize ISR mining. We utilize a “hub-and-spoke” strategy whereby the Hobson Processing Facility acts as the central processing site (the “hub”) for our Palangana Mine and future satellite uranium mining activities, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium Belt (the “spokes”). The Hobson Processing Facility has a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U3O8 annually and is licensed to process up to one million pounds of U3O8 annually.
 
At July 31, 2017, we hold certain mineral rights in various stages in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming and in the Republic of Paraguay, many of which are located in historically successful mining areas and have been the subject of past exploration and pre-extraction activities by other mining companies. We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and/or underground mining techniques.

Our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our uranium extraction activities, which includes advancing certain uranium projects with established mineralized materials towards uranium extraction, and establishing additional mineralized materials on our existing uranium projects or through acquisition of additional uranium projects.
 
During Fiscal 2017, we continued to operate the Palangana Mine at a reduced pace since implementing our strategic plan in September 2013, to align our operations to a weak uranium market in a challenging post-Fukushima environment. This strategy has included the deferral of major pre-extraction expenditures and remaining in a state of operational readiness in anticipation of a recovery in uranium prices.
 
During Fiscal 2017, we made significant advancements in various aspects of its operations including:
 

· | completed a registered offering of 17,330,836 units at a price of $1.50 per unit for gross proceeds of $25,996,254;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | completed the acquisition of the Alto Paraná Titanium Project through the exercise of an option in accordance with a Share Purchase and Option Agreement effective March 4, 2016;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continued to advance permitting activities at the Burke Hollow Project and received a Mine Area Permit from Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Aquifer Exemption Approval from Environmental Protection Agency;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | completed 103 exploration holes totaling 44,480 feet with an average depth of 432 feet at the Burke Hollow Project;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | entered into a Share Purchase Agreement to acquire the fully permitted Reno Creek Project in Wyoming, which was subsequently completed in August 2017; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | achieved inclusion in the Russell 3000® Index.

We recently acquired an undivided 100% interest in five concession blocks in the Alto Paraná Project, a 174,200-acre property located in Paraguay. The Alto Paraná Project is atypically high in titanium values when compared to most beach sand deposits. We propose to further develop the Project to eventually produce high quality titanium slag for use as feedstock in chloride process titanium dioxide pigment manufacture.
 
Uranium Industry Background
 
With the world’s population exceeding seven and a half billion people and growing, the need for electricity is rising and is an important driver for the projected long term increase in nuclear power generation and uranium demand. The world’s current operating fleet of nuclear power plants, in addition to the global growth in new reactors under construction and those planned is testimony to the confidence in nuclear power to provide safe, economical, reliable carbon free energy as part of an overall energy supply mix. As of August 2017, World Nuclear Association (“WNA”) data showed 447 reactors operable worldwide with 58 new reactors under construction, 162 reactors planned or on order and another 349 proposed. Translated into global uranium demand, Ux Consulting Company (“UxC”), a uranium market information source, projects their “URM Base Demand” to increase from about 188 million pounds in 2017 to 199 million pounds in 2024 and about 222 million pounds by 2030.
 
Over the past two years, global growth in nuclear power has been impressive with 20 new reactors reaching commercial operation. The prospects for future growth also looks strong in future years with new and robust programs underway in countries like China, India, United Arab Emirates, etc. China and other countries with growing nuclear programs have embarked on sovereign-backed uranium acquisition programs, building inventory stockpiles for their future requirements. This also includes substantial long-term contracting with western suppliers and taking controlling interests in primary mine production capacity. In addition, Russia, China and South Korea are aggressively pursuing programs to sell their reactors around the globe. In many cases the sales agreements will likely contain turnkey provisions, including uranium supply as a component of the reactor package that will require far more uranium than they currently produce. As such, they will need to be large importers of uranium in the coming years.
 
World base case demand was about 189 million pounds in 2016, exceeding the 162 million pounds of total production by about 27 million pounds. The cumulative gap between existing production and consumption is projected to be about 76 million pounds by 2020 and increases further to almost 230 million pounds in 2025 (UxC 2017 Q2 UMO). The difference between primary production and reactor demand is being filled with secondary market sources. However, recent forecasts expect secondary sources to drop almost 30% from 44 million pounds in 2017 to about 32 million pounds by 2024.

Nuclear generation in the United States increased in 2016, from 797 to 805 billion kilowatt-hours, accounting for 19.7% of the country’s total electrical generation and about 60% of the nation’s clean air energy (Nuclear Energy Institute). The operating U.S. reactor fleet stands at 99 reactors, with two new commercial reactors under construction (Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia). While Summer 2 & 3 in South Carolina have recently been cancelled by their owners (SCANA and Santee Cooper), there are efforts to continue construction on these projects via a new owner.
 
Preserving the existing U.S. nuclear fleet has become a priority for the industry and increasingly, the federal government and the individual states. President Trump has recently said his administration will attempt to expand the nuclear energy sector by launching a "complete review" of current policy to identify ways to revive the industry. One of the most encouraging aspects is recognition by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that nuclear needs to be valued properly for its grid stability attributes and base load generation. The recently released U.S. Department of Energy “Grid Reliability Study” reinforced this point and identified dysfunctional elements of de-regulated energy markets that need to be fixed to achieve that objective and preserve valuable nuclear energy capacity on the U.S. electricity grid. Illinois and New York have both passed measures that will help level the playing field, enabling nuclear energy to continue providing the clean air, highly reliable base load electricity in their energy supply. Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut are also evaluating similar measures.
 
The U.S. remains the world’s largest consumer of uranium with annual requirements of about 50 million pounds of U3O8. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported domestic production totaled 2.5 million pounds in 2016, down 31% from 3.3 million pounds in 2015. This amounts to about 6% of U.S. reactor requirements in 2016 and highlights an extreme U.S. dependency on foreign sources of uranium supply. This situation is expected to become more acute in 2017, with U.S. production forecast to drop below 2 million pounds.
 
Uranium production around the globe increased about 2.5% in 2016 from 158 to 162 million pounds of U3O8. Kazakhstan remained the world’s largest producer; producing 64 million pounds - about 39% of the world’s total production. Many of the projects in various production countries are subject to heightened geopolitical and other risks. In choosing a long-term supplier in this highly concentrated industry, these are important considerations for a utility relying on a secure uranium supply source to fuel their reactor needs.
 
Japan’s March 11, 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami causing the Fukushima Daiichi accident has had a substantial impact on the nuclear fuel markets and resulted in an oversupply situation that has persisted for several years. As this oversupply has continued in the nuclear fuel market during 2016, prices have remained under pressure. Uranium spot market prices have fallen as much as 75% from a March 1, 2011 pre-Fukushima price of $70.00 per pound to a 12 year low at $17.75 per pound in early December of 2016. Since that low, spot prices rallied up above the $26 per pound area in mid-February after the world’s largest producer (Kazatomprom) announced a 10% cut in production. Prices have since pulled back into the low $20/lb area, but have held above the December 2016 lows. A spot price in the low $20/lb range is below the all-in production cost of virtually all global mining operations (UxC Data). This is an unsustainable situation and will eventually result in a strengthening of the market as it transitions from being inventory-driven to production-driven. While Japan’s return to nuclear power post Fukushima has been slower than expected, it’s still progressing with an ultimate goal of producing 20 to 22% of their electrical generation requirements
 
Since Fukushima, there has been a trend of significant production cuts and project deferrals that have continued for several years. Before the Fukushima event, the annual production projection for 2016 in the 2011 Q1 Uranium Market Outlook (UMO) was about 231 million pounds. Actual production in 2016 was about 162 million pounds – a 69 million pound annual decrease over that previously anticipated level. Over this past year, there have been announcements of additional supply cuts, amounting to another 15 million pounds of annual production that is being cancelled or deferred. In addition, there are at least another near 17 million pounds of annual production that will be removed from the current supply base by 2025 as resources are depleted. Beyond those factors, many longer-term high priced contracts fall out of producer portfolios and will likely result in additional production cuts. Those contracts that have been supporting higher cost production will not be replaced and will force higher cost production to be cancelled. We believe this trend is likely to continue absent a substantial and sustained increase in market price. Production cuts, project deferrals and cancellations further exacerbate the growing longer term gap between production and consumption and are likely to increase the prospects for an eventual strong rebound in uranium prices.

Ultimately, the forces of supply and demand will dictate the future uranium market’s direction. Production is likely to decline as higher price contracts supporting elevated production costs expire and as existing resources are depleted. Lead times for new production typically range from 7- 10 years. Various supply-demand projections show annual supply deficits emerging in the early 2020’s. The market appears to be approaching the time when new production should begin the investment required to bring new supply to meet those lead times. As a matter of practice, utilities typically contract for their open needs two to four years in advance of the requirement. As utilities return to the spot, mid and long term markets, the more recent inventory driven market is likely to wane and a production driven market should emerge. All things considered, we believe supply and demand fundamentals have significant potential to force uranium prices upward.
 
TiO2 (Titanium) Industry Background
 
TiO2 is used in many "quality of life" products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending. Historically, the market for large volume TiO2 applications, including coatings, paper and plastics, has experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of lower capacity utilization resulting in declining prices and margins.
 
Demand for titanium minerals such as ilmenite is closely tied to titanium dioxide pigment manufacture. The global TiO2 pigment industry continued to strengthen through the June 2017 quarter. All of the major pigment producers continue to report strong demand and several announced a further round of pigment price increases taking effect through June and July 2017. Positive ilmenite pricing trends seen in 2016 continue in 2017 due to increasing pressure on the availability of titanium dioxide feedstock and pigment, leading to strong ilmenite offtake for many producers. The ongoing strong demand for TiO2 feedstock from pigment plants, now operating at high utilization rates, resulted in further feedstock price increases through the quarter. While ilmenite prices have increased strongly in the past 18 months, there has been a recent decline in Chinese ilmenite spot prices after spiking to very high levels in April 2017. Seasonally weaker Chinese pigment demand and some declines to pigment plant operating rates associated with the enforcement of stricter environmental regulations have resulted in weaker Chinese demand for ilmenite in the September 2017 quarter. In India, ongoing political disruptions to ilmenite exports from Tamil Nadu are now being off-set to some extent by an increase in ilmenite supply from various sources of low quality, high cost concentrates – bolstered by the high market prices. According to Bloomberg, ilmenite bulk concentrate was priced at approximately $170 per ton in July 2017, compared to $60 per ton towards the end of 2015 to early 2016. The ongoing strength in pigment demand and pricing is expected to help stabilize prices for ilmenite at the current healthy levels through the coming quarters.
 
95% of all the mined titanium minerals are used to manufacture pure titanium dioxides – a pigment that enhances brightness and opacity in paints, inks, paper, plastics, food products and cosmetics. The remaining 5% of supply is used in the production of titanium metal. Titanium is also combined with iron, aluminum, vanadium and molybdenum to produce strong, lightweight alloys for aerospace applications.
 
In-Situ Recovery (ISR) Mining
 
We utilize or plan on utilizing in-situ recovery or ISR uranium mining for our South Texas projects including the Palangana Mine and will continue to utilize ISR mining whenever such alternative is available to conventional mining.  When compared to conventional mining, ISR mining requires lower capital expenditures and has a reduced impact on the environment, as well as a shorter lead time to uranium recovery.
 
ISR mining involves circulating oxidized water through an underground uranium deposit, dissolving the uranium and then pumping the uranium-rich solution to the surface for processing. Oxidizing solution enters the formation through a series of injection wells and is drawn to a series of communicating extraction wells. To create a localized hydrologic cone of depression in each wellfield, more groundwater will be produced than injected. Under this gradient, the natural groundwater movement from the surrounding area is toward the wellfield, providing control of the injection fluid. Over-extraction is adjusted as necessary to maintain a cone of depression which ensures that the injection fluid does not move outside the permitted area.

The uranium-rich solution is pumped from the ore zone to the surface and circulated through a series of ion exchange columns located at the mine site.  The solution flows through resin beds inside an ion exchange column where the uranium bonds to small resin beads.  As the solution exits the ion exchange column, it is mostly void of uranium and is re-circulated back to the wellfield and through the ore zone.  Once the resin beads are fully-loaded with uranium, they are transported by truck to the Hobson Processing Facility and transferred to a tank for flushing with a brine solution, or elution, which strips the uranium from the resin beads. The stripped resin beads are then transported back to the mine and reused in the ion exchange columns.  The uranium solution, now free from the resin, is precipitated out and concentrated into a slurry mixture and fed to a filter press to remove unwanted solids and contaminants.  The slurry is then dried in a zero-emissions rotary vacuum dryer, packed in metal drums and shipped out as uranium concentrates, or yellowcake, to ConverDyn for storage and sales.
 
Each project is divided into a mining unit known as a PAA which lies inside an approved Mine Permit Boundary. Each PAA will be developed, extracted and restored as one unit and will have its own set of monitor wells. It is common to have multiple PAAs in extraction at any one time with additional units in various states of exploration, pre-extraction and/or restoration.
 
After mining is complete in a PAA, aquifer restoration will begin as soon as practicable and will continue until the groundwater is restored to pre-mining conditions. Once restoration is complete, a stability period of no less than one year is scheduled with quarterly baseline and monitor well sampling. Wellfield reclamation will follow after aquifer restoration is complete and the stability period has passed.
 
Hobson Processing Facility
 
The Hobson Processing Facility is located in Karnes County, Texas, about 100 miles northwest of Corpus Christi.  It was originally licensed and constructed in 1978, serving as the hub for several satellite mining projects until 1996, and completely refurbished in 2008. On December 18, 2009, we acquired the Hobson Processing Facility as part of the acquisition of South Texas Mining Venture, L.L.P.
 
With a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U3O8 annually and licensed to process up to one million pounds of U3O8 annually, our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our “hub-and-spoke” strategy in the State of Texas, specifically the South Texas Uranium Belt where we utilize ISR mining.
 
Palangana Mine
 
We hold various mining lease and surface use agreements generally having an initial five-year term with extension provisions, granting us the exclusive right to explore, develop and mine for uranium at the Palangana Mine, a 6,987-acre property located in Duval County, Texas, approximately 100 miles south of the Hobson Processing Facility. These agreements are subject to certain royalty and overriding royalty interests indexed to the sale price of uranium.
 
On December 18, 2009, we acquired the Palangana Mine as part of the acquisition of South Texas Mining Venture, L.L.P. In November 2010, the Palangana Mine commenced uranium extraction utilizing ISR mining and in January 2011, the Hobson Processing Facility began processing resins received from the Palangana Mine.
 
Material Relationships Including Long-Term Delivery Contracts
 
At July 31, 2017, we had no uranium supply or “off-take” agreements in place
 
Given that there are up to approximately 60 different companies as potential buyers in the uranium market, we are not substantially dependent upon any single customer to purchase the uranium extracted by us.
Seasonality
 
The timing of our uranium concentrate sales is dependent upon factors such as extraction results from our mining activities, cash requirements, contractual requirements and perception of the uranium market. As a result, our sales are neither tied to nor dependent upon any particular season. In addition, our ability to extract and process uranium does not change on a seasonal basis. Over the past ten years, uranium prices have tended to decline during the calendar third quarter before rebounding during the fourth quarter, but there does not appear to be a strong correlation.

Mineral Rights
 
In Texas, our mineral rights are held exclusively through private leases from the owners of the land/mineral/surface rights with varying terms. In general, these leases provide for uranium and certain other specified mineral rights only including surface access rights for an initial term of five years and renewal for a second five-year term. Production royalties apply which are calculated on a sliding-scale basis tied to the gross sales price of uranium. Remediation of the property is required in accordance with regulatory standards, which may include the posting of reclamation bonds.
 
In Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming, our mineral rights are held either exclusively or through a combination of federal mining claims and state and private mineral leases. Remediation of the property is required in accordance with regulatory standards, which may include the posting of reclamation bonds. Our federal mining claims consist of both unpatented lode and placer mining claims registered with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and the appropriate counties. These claims provide for all mineral rights including surface access rights for an indefinite period. Annual maintenance requirements include BLM claim fees of $155 per claim due yearly on September 1. Our state mineral leases are registered with their respective states. These leases provide for all mineral rights including surface access rights, subject to a production royalty of 4% in Wyoming and 5% to 6% in Arizona, ranging from a five-year term in Arizona to a ten-year term in Wyoming. Annual maintenance requirements include lease fees of $1 and $3 per acre and minimum exploration expenditure requirements of $10 and $20 per acre in Arizona. Our private mineral leases are negotiated directly with the owners of the land/mineral/surface rights with varying terms. These leases provide for uranium and certain other specified mineral rights only, including surface access rights, subject to production royalties, for an initial term of five years and renewal for a second five-year term.


Under the mining laws of the Republic of Paraguay, title to mineral rights for the Yuty Project is held through a “Mineral Concession Contract” approved by the National Congress and signed between the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and the Company, and title to mineral rights for the Oviedo Project is held through a “Mining Permit” granted by the Ministry of Public Works and Communications. These mineral rights provide for the exploration of metallic and non-metallic minerals and precious and semi-precious gems within the territory of Paraguay for up to a 6-year period, and for the exploitation of minerals for a minimum period of 20 years from the beginning of the production phase, extendable for an additional ten years.
 
Burke Hollow Project, Texas
 
We hold various mining lease and surface use agreements having an initial five-year term with extension provisions, granting us the exclusive right to explore, develop and mine for uranium at the Burke Hollow Project, a 19,335-acre property located in Bee County, Texas, subject to certain royalty interests indexed to the sale price of uranium.
Goliad Project, Texas
 
We hold various mining lease and surface use agreements having an initial five-year term with extension provisions, granting us the exclusive right to explore, develop and mine for uranium at the Goliad Project, a 995-acre property located in Goliad County, Texas, subject to certain royalty interests indexed to the sale price of uranium.
Longhorn Project, Texas
 
We hold various mining lease and surface use agreements having an initial five-year term with extension provisions, granting us the exclusive right to explore, develop and mine for uranium at the Longhorn Project, a 651-acre property located in Live Oak County, Texas, subject to certain royalty interests indexed to the sale price of uranium.

We hold an undivided 100% interest in contiguous mineral lode claims in the Slick Rock Project, a 5,333-acre property located in San Miguel County, Colorado. Certain claims of the Slick Rock Project are subject to a 1.0% or 3.0% net smelter royalty, the latter requiring an annual advance royalty payment of $30,000 beginning in November 2017.
Yuty Project, Paraguay
 
We hold an undivided 100% interest in one exploitation concession in the Yuty Project, a 289,680-acre property located in Paraguay, subject to an overriding royalty payable of $0.21 for each pound of uranium produced from the property.
Oviedo Project, Paraguay
 
We hold an undivided 100% interest in one exploration permit in the Oviedo Project, a 464,548-acre property located in Paraguay, subject to a 1.5% gross overriding royalty over which we have an exclusive right and option at any time to acquire 0.5% for $166,667 and a right of first refusal to acquire all or any portion of the remaining 1.0%.
Alto Paraná Titanium Project, Paraguay
 
We hold an undivided 100% interest in five concession blocks in the Alto Paraná Titanium Project, a 174,200-acre property located in Paraguay. The property is subject to 1.5% net smelter returns royalty. We have the right, exercisable at any time for a period of six years following our acquisition, to acquire 0.5% of the royalty at a purchase price of $500,000.
Environmental Regulation
 
Our activities will be subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Our operations will be subject to stringent environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RCT”), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”).
 
In Texas, surface extraction and exploration for uranium is regulated by the RCT, while in-situ uranium extraction is regulated by the TCEQ. An exploration permit is the initial permit granted by the RCT that authorizes exploration drilling activities inside an approved area. This permit authorizes specific drilling and plugging activities requiring documentation for each borehole drilled. All documentation is submitted to the RCT on a monthly basis and each borehole drilled under the exploration permit is inspected by an RCT inspector to ensure compliance. At July 31, 2017, we held one exploration permit in each of Bee, Duval, and Goliad Counties.

Before in-situ uranium extraction can begin in Texas, a number of permits must be granted by the TCEQ.
 
A Mine Area Permit application is required for submission to the TCEQ to establish a specific permit area boundary, aquifer exemption boundary and the mineral zones of interests or production zones. The application also includes a financial surety plan to ensure funding for all plugging and abandonment requirements. Funding for surety is in the form of cash or bonds, including an excess of 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2017, we held Mine Area Permits, for the Palangana Mine, the Goliad Project and the Burke Hollow Project.
 
A Radioactive Material License (“RML”) application is also required for submission to the TCEQ for authorization to operate a uranium recovery facility. The application includes baseline environmental data for soil, vegetation, surface water and groundwater along with operational sampling frequencies and locations. A Radiation Safety Manual is a key component of the application which defines the environmental health and safety programs and procedures to protect employees and the environment. Another important component of the application is a financial surety mechanism to ensure plant and wellfield decommissioning is properly funded and maintained. Surety funding is in the form of cash or bonds and includes an excess of 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2017, we held RMLs for the Palangana Mine, Goliad Project and Hobson Processing Facility.
 
Production Area Authorization applications are also required for submission to the TCEQ to establish specific extraction areas inside the Mine Area Permit boundary. These are typically 30 to 100 acre units that have been delineated and contain producible quantities of uranium. The PAA application includes baseline water quality data that is characteristic of that individual unit, proposes upper control limits for monitor well analysis and establishes restoration values. The application will also include a financial security plan for wellfield restoration and reclamation which must be funded and in place prior to commencing uranium extraction. At July 31, 2017, we held four PAA permits for the Palangana Mine and one for the Goliad Project.
 
A Class I disposal well permit application is also required for submission to the TCEQ for authorization for deep underground wastewater injection. It is the primary method for disposing of excess fluid from the extraction areas and for reverse osmosis concentrate during the restoration phase. This permit authorizes injection into a specific injection zone within a designated injection interval. The permit requires continuous monitoring of numerous parameters including injection flow rate, injection pressure, annulus pressure and injection/annulus differential pressure. Mechanical integrity testing is required initially and annually to ensure the well is mechanically sound. Surety funding for plugging and abandonment of each well is in the form of cash or bonds, including 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2017, we held two Class I disposal well permits for the Hobson Processing Facility, Palangana Satellite Facility, Burke Hollow Project and the Goliad Project.
 
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) creates a regulatory program to protect groundwater and is administered by the EPA.  The SDWA allows states to issue underground injection control (“UIC”) permits under two conditions: the state’s program must have been granted primacy and the EPA must have granted an aquifer exemption upon the state’s request.  Texas, being a primacy state, is therefore authorized to grant UIC permits and makes the official requests for an aquifer exemption to the EPA.  The aquifer exemption request is submitted by the Company to the TCEQ, and once approved, is then submitted by the TCEQ to the EPA for concurrence and final issuance.  At July 31, 2017, we held an aquifer exemption for the Palangana Mine, Goliad Project and Burke Hollow Project.
 
Waste Disposal
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes affect minerals exploration and production activities by imposing regulations on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” and on the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
 
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (collectively “Hazardous Substances”). These classes of persons or potentially responsible parties include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility or property where there is or has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the Hazardous Substances found at such a facility. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs of such action. We may also in the future become an owner of facilities on which Hazardous Substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may in the future be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities or property at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages.
Air Emissions
 
Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed permitting requirements. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources. In Texas, the TCEQ issues an exemption for those processes that meet the criteria for low to zero emission by issuing a Permit by Rule. Presently the Palangana Mine, the Hobson Processing Facility and the Goliad Project all have Permits by Rule covering air emissions.
Clean Water Act
 
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes, including mineral processing wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters. The CWA provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and other pollutants. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or it derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and costs. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Competition
 
The uranium industry is highly competitive, and our competition includes larger, more established companies with longer operating histories that not only explore for and produce uranium, but also market uranium and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Due to their greater financial and technical resources, we may not be able to acquire additional uranium projects in a competitive bidding process involving such companies. Additionally, these larger companies have greater resources to continue with their operations during periods of depressed market conditions.
 
The global TiO2 market is highly competitive, with the top six producers accounting for approximately 60% of the world's production capacity according to TZMI. Competition is based on a number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Among our competitors are companies that are vertically-integrated (those that have their own raw material resources).
 
Research and Development Activities
 
No research and development expenditures have been incurred, either on our account or sponsored by customers, for the three most recently completed Fiscal years.
