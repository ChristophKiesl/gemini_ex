Item 1. Business.
Overview
Drive Shack Inc. (and with its subsidiaries, “Drive Shack Inc.” or the “Company”) is a leading owner and operator of golf-related leisure and entertainment businesses. Drive Shack Inc. conducts its business through three primary segments: (1) Traditional Golf properties, (2) Entertainment Golf venues and (3) Debt Investments. 
On December 28, 2016, the Company changed its name from Newcastle Investment Corp. to Drive Shack Inc. in connection with its transformation to a leisure and entertainment company. The Company was formed in 2002 and its common stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol “DS.”

• | Traditional Golf | American Golf

American Golf is one of the largest owners and operators of golf properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we owned, leased or managed 78 properties across 13 states. American Golf and its dedicated employees are focused on delivering lasting experiences for our customers, including our more than 50,000 members, who played over 4 million rounds at our courses in 2016. 
American Golf was acquired by Drive Shack Inc. in December 2013, when the Company restructured an existing mezzanine debt investment related to NGP Realty Sub, L.P. and American Golf Corporation (together, “American Golf”). As part of the restructuring, Drive Shack Inc. acquired the equity of American Golf’s indirect parent, AGC Mezzanine Pledge LLC.
Our operations are organized into three principal categories: (1) Public Properties, (2) Private Properties and (3) Managed Properties.
Public Properties.   Our 49 public properties generate revenues principally through daily green fees, golf cart rentals and food, beverage and merchandise sales.  Amenities at these properties generally include practice facilities and pro shops with food and beverage facilities.  In some cases, our public properties have small clubhouses with banquet facilities. In addition, The Players Club is a monthly membership program offered at most of our public properties, with membership benefits ranging from daily range access to ability to participate in golf clinics, in return for a monthly membership fee.
Private Properties.   Our 19 private properties are open to members only and generate revenues principally through initiation fees, membership dues, guest fees, and food, beverage and merchandise sales. Amenities at these courses typically include practice facilities, full service clubhouses with a pro shop, locker room facilities and multiple food and beverage outlets, including grills, restaurants and banquet facilities. 
Managed Properties. Our 10 managed properties are properties that American Golf manages pursuant to a management agreement with the owner of each property.  We recognize revenue from these properties in an amount equal to the respective management fee.

• | Entertainment Golf | Drive Shack

Drive Shack is an entertainment company that combines golf, competition, dining and fun. Drive Shack plans to open a chain of next-generation entertainment golf venues across the United States and internationally, with each venue featuring multiple stories of hitting suites where friends, family, co-workers or complete strangers may compete in a technologically-enhanced golf games. Consumers who are seeking a good time, but not looking to participate in the game, would be able to spectate from one of Drive Shack’s restaurant or lounge areas. Drive Shack is developing its inaugural site in Orlando, Florida. 

• | Debt Investments | Loans & Securities

The Company historically invested in loans and securities. As the Company continues to transform to a leisure and entertainment company, under the name Drive Shack, management is working to optimize and monetize the loans and securities owned through pay downs and sales. 
As of December 31, 2016, our debt investment portfolio consists primarily of agency Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac (“FNMA/FHLMC”) securities and our investment in a resorts-related loan as described below.
As of December 31, 2016, we hold 15 Agency FNMA/FHLMC fixed rate securities with a carrying value of $627.3 million. See Note 5 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information about our agency FNMA/FHLMC securities. 
In April 2010, we made a cash investment of $75.0 million through two of our CDOs in a new loan to Intrawest Cayman L.P. and its subsidiaries (“Intrawest”), which is a portfolio company of private equity funds managed by an affiliate of our Manager. In addition, Mr. Wesley R. Edens is Chairman of our board of directors and a director of Intrawest, and has an indirect ownership interest in Intrawest. Interest on the loan is accrued and deferred until maturity in 2019. In accordance with the loan agreement, as of April 24, 2015, the accrued and deferred interest rate stepped-up from 15.55% to 22.50%.  On September 23, 2016, Drive Shack Inc. received a $109.9 million pay down on this loan. The face amount of the loan was $61.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Interest accrued on the loan accounts for a significant portion of our interest income and Core Earnings (as defined in Part II, Item 6. “Selected Financial Data” under “Core Earnings”). We could be adversely affected if we are unable to recover our investment in the loan.
For a further discussion of the change in our reportable segments in addition to financial results, see Note 4 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” See Note 13 to Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information about transactions with affiliates and affiliated entities.

Developments in 2016
Traditional Golf - Long-Term Financing
In June 2016, the Company obtained third-party financing on 22 traditional golf properties for a total of $102.0 million and used $64.9 million of the proceeds to repay its golf loans repurchase agreement. See Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Traditional Golf - Property Updates
In January 2016, the lease on a golf property in Oregon expired and we did not renew the lease for such property. In July 2016, the lease on a golf property in California was terminated and we exited the property. In October 2016, the leases of certain golf properties in Georgia and California expired and we exited the properties.  In October 2016, we also entered into a management agreement for an 18-hole golf property in Tustin, California, for a term of 4.5 years.  In December 2016, the lease on a golf property in Oklahoma expired and we exited the property.
Entertainment Golf - Announced Inaugural Site
During November, the Company announced plans to develop its first entertainment golf venue, a three-story, innovative driving range and restaurant venue in Orlando, Florida.
Debt Investments - Continued Monetization
On September 23, 2016, we received a $109.9 million pay down on a corporate loan in the resorts industry (“the resort-related loan”) as further detailed in the “Debt Investments” section below. These proceeds will be used to reinvest in the development of Entertainment Golf. See Note 13 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Corporate Shift - New Management & Structure
In September 2016, a new management team was put in place to drive the strategic priorities of the Company in its continued transformation to a leisure and entertainment company from a financial services company. In connection with this transformation, on February 23, 2017, the Company revoked its election to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) effective January 1, 2017. The Company operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes through December 31, 2016. See Note 15 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.
Debt Obligations
Details regarding our debt obligations are presented in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,” as well as Note 11 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Our Investment Guidelines 
In connection with our decision to terminate our election to be treated as a REIT (as discussed above), our board of directors approved updates to our investment guidelines to remove any REIT-related compliance requirements. 
Our investment guidelines are purposefully broad to enable us to make investments in a wide array of assets. Our investment guidelines state:

• | no investment is to be made which would cause us to be regulated as an investment company;


• | no more than 20% of our total equity, determined as of the date of such investment, is to be invested in any single asset;


• | our leverage (as defined in our governing documents) is not to exceed 90% of the sum of our total debt and total equity; and


• | we are not to co-invest with the Manager or any of its affiliates unless (i) our co-investment is otherwise in accordance with these guidelines and (ii) the terms of such co-investment are at least as favorable to us as to the Manager or such affiliate (as applicable) making such co-investment.

These investment guidelines may be changed by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. We do not have specific policies as to the allocation among type of investment categories.

The Management Agreement 
We are party to an amended and restated management agreement with FIG LLC, our Manager and an affiliate of Fortress (the “Management Agreement”), pursuant to which our Manager provides for a management team and other professionals who are responsible for implementing our business strategy, subject to the supervision of our board of directors.  Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, (i) setting investment criteria in accordance with broad investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors, (ii) sourcing, analyzing and executing acquisitions, (iii) providing financial and accounting management services and (iv) performing other duties as specified in the Management Agreement.
The Management Agreement provides for automatic one year extensions. Our independent directors review our Manager’s performance annually and the Management Agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors, or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or a determination by our independent directors that the management fee earned by our Manager is not fair, subject to our Manager’s right to prevent such a management fee compensation termination by accepting a mutually acceptable reduction of fees. Our Manager must be provided with 60 days’ prior notice of any such termination and would be paid a termination fee equal to the amount of the management fee earned by our Manager during the twelve month period preceding such termination, which may make it difficult and costly for us to terminate the management agreement. Following any termination of the Management Agreement, we shall be entitled to purchase our Manager’s right to receive the Incentive Compensation at a price determined as if our assets were sold for cash at their then current fair market value (as determined by an appraisal, taking into account, among other things, the expected future value of the underlying investments) or otherwise we may continue to pay the Incentive Compensation to our Manager. In addition, if we do not purchase our Manager’s Incentive Compensation, our Manager may require us to purchase the same at the price discussed above. In addition, the Management Agreement may be terminated by us at any time for cause.
In connection with our decision to terminate our election to be treated as a REIT (as discussed above), our board of directors approved the entry into an amended and restated Management Agreement with FIG LLC, our Manager and an affiliate of Fortress, effective January 1, 2017, to remove any REIT-related compliance requirements and to reflect our decision to change our name to Drive Shack Inc.
On February 14, 2017, Fortress announced that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with an affiliate of SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank”), pursuant to which Fortress will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the SoftBank affiliate (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, Fortress will operate within SoftBank as an independent business headquartered in New York. Fortress’s senior investment professionals are expected to remain in place, including those individuals who perform services for us.
See Note 13 to Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information related to the terms of the management agreement.
Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities 
Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future. We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries. We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and our investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders. In the event that we determine to raise additional equity capital, our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject to certain NYSE requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property. Decisions regarding the form and other characteristics of the financing for our investments are made by our Manager subject to the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors.
Competition 
We operate in a highly competitive industry, and compete primarily on the basis of reputation, location and the perceived value of our properties and facilities. Our ability to compete with other golf and entertainment facilities directly affects our ability to succeed. 
In addition, we are subject to significant competition in seeking investments. We compete with other companies, including publicly traded golf, leisure and/or entertainment companies, private equity firms and other investors including funds and companies

affiliated with our Manager. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we possess, or have greater access to capital or various types of financing than are available to us, and we may not be able to compete successfully for investments or provide attractive investments returns relative to our competitors. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any targeted benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances.
We also compete for discretionary leisure and entertainment spending with other types of recreational and entertainment facilities, including entertainment retail and restaurants. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition in the future from other entertainment retail concepts that are similar to ours.
For more information about the competition we face generally and in our Traditional and Entertainment Golf businesses specifically, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Competition in the industry in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
Seasonality
Traditional Golf is subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by significant reductions in golf activities as well as revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each year, due to shorter days and colder temperatures.  Consequently, a significantly larger portion of our revenue from our Traditional Golf operations is earned in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In addition, severe weather patterns can also negatively impact our results of operations.
Government Regulation of Our Traditional Golf Business
Our Traditional Golf properties and operations are subject to a number of environmental laws. As a result, we may be required to incur costs to comply with the requirements of these laws, such as those relating to water resources, discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by regulated materials. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases from currently owned, formerly owned or operated facilities.
Environmental laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the relevant entity knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. We may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under such laws, and from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Our facilities are also subject to risks associated with mold, asbestos and other indoor building contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing for our property. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements.
In addition, in order to improve, upgrade or expand some of our facilities, we may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act and, for projects in California, the California Environmental Quality Act. Both acts require that a specified government agency study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Any improvement proposal may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.
We are also subject to regulation by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations impact a number of aspects of operations, including golf course maintenance and food handling and preparation.
The ownership and operation of our facilities subjects us to federal, state and local laws regulating zoning, land development, land use, building design and construction, and other real estate-related laws and regulations.
Our facilities and operations are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (the “ADA”). The rules implementing the ADA have been further revised by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which included additional compliance requirements for golf facilities and recreational areas. The ADA generally requires that we remove architectural barriers when readily achievable so that our facilities are made accessible to people with disabilities. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Federal legislation or regulations may further amend the ADA to impose more stringent requirements with which we would have to comply.

We are also subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. For instance, we must comply with provisions regulating equal employment, minimum wages, and licensing requirements and regulations for the sale of food and alcoholic beverages.
Taxation 
On February 23, 2017, the Company revoked its election to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), effective January 1, 2017. The Company operated in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes through December 31, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2017, we are generally subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to stockholders declared on or after January 1, 2017 are not deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial, including due to certain deferred cancellation of indebtedness income. Although we have net operating losses that may be available to reduce our taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes and thereby reduce this tax liability, no assurances can be given that those losses will remain usable or will not become subject to limitations (including under Section 382 of the Code), and those losses may in any event not be usable in reducing our income for alternative minimum tax, state, local or other tax purposes. In particular, as discussed in more detail below, if the Company has undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, the Company could incur materially greater tax liability than if the Company had not undergone such an ownership change. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Employees
As described above under “– The Management Agreement,” we are managed by FIG LLC, an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC. As a result, except in our golf operations which are discussed below, we have no employees. The employees of FIG LLC are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
Traditional Golf and Entertainment Golf
As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 4,700 employees at our golf facilities, consisting primarily of hourly employees. Other than a small group of golf course maintenance staff at one of our clubs, our employees are not unionized. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees, and our business has not experienced interruptions as a result of labor disputes.
Corporate Governance and Internet Address; Where Readers Can Find Additional Information 
We emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. Our board of directors consists of a majority of independent directors; the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees of our board of directors are composed exclusively of independent directors. We have adopted corporate governance guidelines, and a code of business conduct and ethics, which delineate our standards for our officers and directors, and employees of our Manager.
