--------+---------

The Company
 Flowers Foods, Inc. (which we reference to herein as “we,” “our,” “us,” the “company,” “Flowers” or “Flowers Foods”), founded in 1919 as a Georgia corporation and headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia, is currently the second-largest producer and marketer of packaged bakery foods in the United States (“U.S.”).  Our principal products include breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas and are sold under a variety of brand names, including Nature’s Own, Dave’s Killer Bread (“DKB”), Wonder, Canyon Bakehouse, Tastykake, and Mrs. Freshley’s.  Our brands are among the best known in the baking industry. Many of our brands have a major presence in the product categories in which they compete. 
 Flowers’ strategic priorities include developing our team, focusing on our brands, prioritizing our margins, and proactively seeking out smart, disciplined acquisitions and are described further in the following section.  We believe executing on our strategic priorities will drive future growth and margin expansion and deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.   
 COVID-19 
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide, which has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies. Due to the drastic change in consumer buying patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a favorable shift in sales mix to our branded retail products resulting in significant growth in income from operations in Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019.  If, in future periods, there is a shift in mix away from our branded retail products to store branded and non-retail products, we expect that our results of operations, including our net sales, earnings and cash flows, could be negatively impacted.   
 In recognition and support of our frontline workers, we paid a total of $12.3 million in appreciation bonuses to eligible hourly and non-exempt employees, leased labor, and contract workers in Fiscal 2020.  These appreciation bonuses are in addition to the company’s annual bonus program.  
 On April 14, 2020, we temporarily ceased production at our Tucker, Georgia bakery and on July 9, 2020, we temporarily ceased production at our Savannah, Georgia bakery.  Both closures were due to an increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at these bakeries and the related increase in number of workers self-quarantining.  Production resumed at the Tucker bakery on April 27, 2020 and at the Savannah Bakery on July 17, 2020.  While our other bakeries were able to assist with meeting production needs in these instances, the closure of several of our bakeries across the country at one time or in close succession could negatively impact our ability to meet our production requirements.
 While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our net sales, earnings and cash flows, will continue to be impacted by decreases in foodservice and other non-retail outlets sales.  Foodservice sales are likely to remain under pressure until the restaurant industry returns to more normal operations.  We cannot predict the timing and speed of the foodservice industry recovery, and any delay in the recovery could significantly impact our future results.  We continue to actively monitor the collectability of our trade accounts receivables, particularly our foodservice customers.  We may incur losses in the future if these customers are forced into financial distress or bankruptcy and cannot pay us or their other suppliers on a timely basis or at all.
 We continue to actively monitor the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and are taking steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread and related circumstances and impacts. We are focused on navigating these challenges presented by the COVID-19 global pandemic through the implementation of additional procedures at each of our locations to comply with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations.  These procedures and actions include, but are not limited to, monitoring the symptoms of all team members and essential visitors entering our facilities, requiring face coverings, maintaining (where possible) six feet of distance, conducting enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and frequently touched surfaces, performing additional decontamination of work areas and equipment if there is a confirmed or presumptive case of COVID-19 at a facility, and other considerations.  Certain non-production employees have also been working remotely to mitigate contact between personnel.  Non-essential travel and non-essential visitors bans also were implemented to reduce potential exposure. We are considering the options available to us under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (“FFCRA Act”), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), and the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CCA Act”). As of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, we began taking advantage of deferrals of certain payroll tax payments in accordance with the CARES Act. In addition, we continue to evaluate the impact of certain tax credits that are available under these Acts.  We have also availed ourselves of the deferral of federal income tax payments made available under an emergency declaration on March 13, 2020. The evolving COVID-19 pandemic could continue to impact our results of operations and liquidity; the operations of our suppliers, 
 4


vendors, and customers; and our employees as a result of health concerns, quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions.
 Strategic Initiatives 
 In June 2016, the company launched Project Centennial, a comprehensive business and operational review.  We identified opportunities to enhance revenue growth, streamline operations, improve efficiencies, and make investments that strengthen our competitive position and improve margins over the long term.  We began Project Centennial with an evaluation of our brands, product mix, and organizational structure.  On May 3, 2017, the company announced an enhanced organizational structure designed to provide greater focus on the company’s long-term strategic objectives, emphasize brand growth and innovation in line with a national branded food company, drive enhanced accountability, and reduce costs.  The new organizational structure established two business units (“BUs”) - Fresh Packaged Bread and Snacking/Specialty - and realigned key leadership roles.  The new structure also provided for centralized marketing, sales, supply chain, shared services/administrative, and corporate strategy functions, each with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  On July 17, 2020, the company implemented additional organizational structure changes designed to increase focus on brand growth, product innovation, and improving underperforming bakeries.  As part of this realignment, the two BUs were combined into one single function that is responsible for all of our brands.
 Project Centennial marked a significant shift in mindset from a sales and operations focused enterprise to a brand focused packaged foods company.  Strategic priorities developed as part of Project Centennial were designed to improve margins and profitably grow revenue over time.  These priorities included: reducing costs to fuel growth, developing leading capabilities, reinvigorating core business, and capitalizing on product adjacencies.  
 Today, we are a brand focused company dedicated to the consumer and committed to growing our most profitable brands through innovation, market expansion, and prudent mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”).  Based on insights gained from the completion of Project Centennial, we have redefined our strategic priorities and our long-term goals which are as follows:
 Strategic Priorities:
  
• | Develop team: Capabilities to build brands and create value.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on brands: Enhance relevancy and expand presence. Invest in our brands to align with consumers to maximize our return on investment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prioritize margins: Optimize the portfolio and supply chain.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smart M&A: Disciplined approach to acquisitions in the grain-based foods arena that enhance our branded portfolio and margin profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term Goals:
  
• | Grow sales by 1% to 2% annually (excluding any future acquisitions).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow EBITDA by 4% to 6% annually (excluding any future acquisitions) (The company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow earnings per share by 7% to 9% annually.
--+----------------------------------------------

 The key to our success in achieving our goals is our talented and dedicated team.  We recognize the importance of investing in our people as further discussed in the “Human Capital Resources” section below, which details how we attract, retain, and develop our team.  Additionally, we recognize the importance of realigning people and responsibilities in successfully implementing our long-term strategies.  This realignment can take the form of organizational changes or providing crucial tools, including investments in our information systems.  During Fiscal 2020, we implemented organizational changes to better align the team to our new strategies, hired new team members with unique expertise and insight, and created the transformation office.  The transformation office is a cross-functional team responsible for over-overseeing the implementation of our strategic priorities, including our digital and ERP initiative, which is discussed in more detail under the “Digital Strategy Initiative” section below.  
 A major focus of our long-term strategy is to evolve our sales portfolio to higher margin, value-added branded retail products that we expect will drive top line growth and improve overall profitability. We expect an optimized portfolio will drive share gains by targeting growth segments with new, innovative products.  We have established clear roles for the brands and product lines within our portfolio to enable more targeted decision-making on brand investment.  Over the past several years, we have completed brand rationalization initiatives resulting in a more streamlined brand and product assortment, reduced brand portfolio complexity, and 
 5


increased efficiency.  In Fiscal 2020, our sales mix shifted to more profitable branded retail products due to increases in at-home dining resulting from COVID-19, which led to increased sales and operating income, further illustrating the potential of an optimized portfolio.  
 As we implement our targeted sales portfolio strategy, the flexibility of our production and distribution systems allows us to pivot capacity to meet this changing demand.  As an example, in Fiscal 2020, we repurposed bakery assets at our Lynchburg, Virginia facility, converting it to an all-organic bakery to meet rising demand for our DKB products and to better serve east coast markets with fresher product and reduce distribution costs.  Additionally, we believe our flexible bakery system has been crucial in navigating demand changes caused by the pandemic as we have been able to quickly shift production to high demand products and adjust distribution where needed. We are continuing to optimize our distribution system by reducing network complexity through depot consolidation and reducing transport miles. 
 M&A has always been, and we expect will continue to be, an important part of our long-term growth strategy.  We employ a disciplined approach to M&A, seeking out candidates primarily in the grain-based foods arena that will enhance our branded portfolio, extend our geographic presence, are a strong cultural fit, and add enhanced capabilities to our company.  We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation will enable us to execute our M&A strategy.  
 Digital Strategy Initiative 
 We have launched a digital strategy initiative to transform our information systems and processes.  This includes upgrading our information system to a more robust platform and is expected to improve data management and efficiencies while automating many of our processes.  The primary goals of this new strategic initiative are: (1) enable more agility in our business model, empowering the organization by fundamentally redesigning core business processes and our ways of working; (2) embed digital capabilities where it matters and transform the way we engage with our consumers, our customers and our employees; and (3) modernize and simplify our application and configuration landscape to remove existing roadblocks and support new ways of working with the new ERP system becoming a key enabler of our business strategies. We completed the initial planning and road mapping phase of this multi-year project as of the end of Fiscal 2020 and transitioned into the design phase in early Fiscal 2021.  We expect this initiative will require significant capital investment and expense over the next several years.  See Item 1A., Risk Factors, “We may experience difficulties in designing and implementing our new ERP system.”
 Segment
 Since the beginning of Fiscal 2019, we have managed our business as one operating segment.  As discussed above, due to the organizational structure changes implemented under Project Centennial, the company concluded it has one operating segment based on the nature of the products the company sells, its intertwined production and distribution model, the internal management structure and information that is regularly reviewed by the chief executive officer (“CEO”), who is the chief operating decision maker, for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources.  Beginning with the first quarter of Fiscal 2019, the comparative periods have been presented on a consolidated basis due to the change to a single operating segment.  See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for more detailed financial information about our operating segment.

The chart below presents our Fiscal 2020 sales by sales category (source:  internal sales data warehouse (“SDW”); amounts may not compute due to rounding). 
 


Our brands are some of the best-known in the U.S. fresh packaged bread industry and hold leading market positions in the categories in which they compete.  We believe having a well-diversified portfolio of brands allows us to be more competitive in the marketplace and appeal to a broader range of consumers. Our principal products are breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas.  The table below presents the major brands within our diversified brand portfolio:

Our brands and products are sold through various channels throughout the U.S.  The table below presents our sales by channel for Fiscal 2020 (source:  internal SDW; amounts may not compute due to rounding). 
 

* All Other includes thrift store, vending, and retail distributor sales.
 Marketing
 We support our key brands with an advertising and marketing effort that targets consumers through electronic and in-store coupons, social media (such as Facebook and Twitter), digital media (including e-newsletters to consumers), websites (our brand sites and third-party sites), event and sports marketing, on-package promotional offers and sweepstakes, and print advertising. When appropriate, we may join other sponsors with promotional tie-ins. We often focus our marketing efforts on specific products and holidays, such as hamburger and hot dog bun sales during Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, and snack cakes for specific seasons.  Additionally, we have and are continuing to make marketing investments to target e-commerce sales as consumers shift to more online shopping alternatives, such as grocery delivery sites, retailer websites and apps, among others.  
Customers
 Our top 10 customers in Fiscal 2020 accounted for 53.6% of sales. During Fiscal 2020, our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, represented 21.2% of the company’s sales. The loss of, or a material negative change in our relationship with, Walmart/Sam’s Club or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business. Walmart/Sam’s Club was the only customer to account for 10.0% or more of our sales during Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018.  
 Fresh baked foods’ customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers, restaurants, quick-serve chains, food wholesalers, institutions, dollar stores, and vending companies. We also sell returned and surplus product through a system of thrift stores. The company currently operates 246 such stores and reported sales of $71.9 million during Fiscal 2020 from these outlets.
 We also (1) supply national and regional restaurants, institutions and foodservice distributors, and retail in-store bakeries with breads and rolls; (2) sell packaged bakery products to wholesale distributors for ultimate sale to a wide variety of food outlets; and (3) sell packaged snack cakes primarily to customers who distribute them nationwide through multiple channels of distribution, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, vending outlets and convenience stores. In certain circumstances, we enter into co-packing arrangements with retail customers or other food companies, some of which are competitors.  While we service public health care, military commissaries, and prisons, among other governmental institutions, we do not have any material government contracts.
 Distribution
 We distribute our products through a direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) distribution system and a warehouse delivery system.  The DSD distribution system involves aggregating order levels and delivering products from bakeries to independent distributors for sale 
 8


and direct delivery to customer stores. The independent distributors are responsible for ordering products, stocking shelves, maintaining special displays, and developing and maintaining good customer relations to ensure adequate inventory and removing unsold goods.  The warehouse delivery system involves primarily delivering our products to customers’ warehouses.
 The company has sold the majority of the distribution rights for territories to independent distributors under long-term financing arrangements. Independent distributors, highly motivated by financial incentives from their distribution rights ownership, strive to increase sales by offering outstanding service and merchandising. Independent distributors have the opportunity to benefit directly from the enhanced value of their distribution rights resulting from higher branded sales volume.
 Our DSD distribution system is comprised of three types of territories: (1) independent distributor-owned and operated territories (independent distributors own the rights to distribute certain brands of our fresh packaged bakery foods in defined geographic markets); (2) distribution rights that are classified as available for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets; and (3) other company operated territories.  The table below presents the approximate number of territories used by the company as of January 2, 2021:
 
 
Type of territory | Number of territories | 
-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+------
Independent distributor-owned and operated territories | | 5,498
Territories classified as available for sale | | 366 
Other company operated territories | | 96 
Total territories | | 5,960

 

Our warehouse distribution system delivers a portion of our packaged bakery snack products from a central distribution facility located near our Crossville, Tennessee snack cake bakery. We believe this centralized distribution system allows us to achieve both production and distribution efficiencies. Products coming from different bakeries are then cross-docked and shipped directly to customers’ warehouses nationwide. Our frozen bread and roll products are shipped to various outside freezer facilities for distribution to our customers.
 Intellectual Property
 We own a number of trademarks, trade names, patents, and licenses. The company also sells products under franchised and licensed trademarks and trade names which we do not own pursuant to contractual arrangements.  We consider all of our trademarks and trade names important to our business since we use them to build strong brand awareness and consumer loyalty.
Raw Materials
 Our primary baking ingredients are flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast and water. We also purchase organic and gluten-free ingredients.  We also use paper products, such as corrugated cardboard, films and plastics to package our bakery foods. We strive to maintain diversified sources for all of our baking ingredients and packaging products.  In addition, we are dependent on natural gas or propane as fuel for firing our ovens. 
 Commodities, such as our baking ingredients, periodically experience price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the impact of such volatility in raw material prices, but some organic and specialty ingredients do not offer the same hedging opportunities to reduce the impact of price volatility.  Any decrease in the supply available under these agreements and instruments could increase the effective price of these raw materials to us and significantly impact our earnings. 
 Regulations 
 As a producer and marketer of food items, our operations are subject to regulation by various federal governmental agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”).  We also are subject to the regulations of various state agencies, with respect to production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, labor, and local regulations regarding the licensing of bakeries and the enforcement of state standards and facility inspections.  Under various statutes and regulations, these federal and state agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for quality, purity, and labeling.  Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements could result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves.  
 9


Advertising of our businesses is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, and we are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
 The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business.  We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all material federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the company and its properties.  
 Our operations, like those of similar businesses, are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality and underground fuel storage tanks, as well as other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment.  The company is not a party to any material proceedings arising under these laws and regulations.  We believe compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect the Consolidated Financial Statements or the competitive position of the company.  The company is currently in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations affecting the company and its properties.
 Competitive Overview
 The U.S. market for fresh and frozen bakery products is estimated at $37.6 billion at retail. This category is intensely competitive and has continued to experience consolidation. From a national standpoint, Flowers Foods is currently the second-largest company in the U.S. fresh baking industry based on market share as presented in the following chart (amounts may not compute due to rounding). (Source:  IRI Flowers custom database, 52 weeks ending 12-27-20; Flowers private label sales from SDW): 
 

The current competitive landscape for breads and rolls in the U.S. baking industry consists of Bimbo Bakeries USA (BBU), Flowers Foods, and Campbell Soup Company, under the Pepperidge Farm brand, along with a number of smaller independent regional bakers, local bakeries, and retailer-owned bakeries. 
 Some of these smaller regional bakers do not enjoy the competitive advantages of larger operations, including greater brand awareness and economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, production, IT, advertising and marketing. However, size alone is not sufficient to ensure success in our industry. The company faces significant competition from regional and independent bakeries in certain geographic areas.
 Competition in the baking industry continues to be driven by a number of factors, including the ability to serve retail and foodservice customers, generational changes in family-owned businesses, and competitors’ promotional efforts on branded bread and store brands. Competition typically is based on the ability to target changing consumer preferences, product availability (including through e-commerce channels), product quality, brand loyalty, price, and effective promotions. Customer service, including frequent deliveries to keep store shelves well-stocked, is also a competitive factor.
 10


The company also faces competition from store brands that are produced either by us or our competitors. Store brands (also known as “private label”) have been offered by food retailers for decades. With the growth of mass merchandisers like Walmart and the ongoing consolidation of regional supermarkets into larger operations, store brands have become a significant competitor to the company in those areas where the company does not have the contract to produce the store brand. The store brand share of retail fresh packaged bread in the U.S. accounts for approximately 20% of the dollar sales and approximately 30% of unit sales, though its share has steadily declined over the past six years.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of January 2, 2021, Flowers and its subsidiaries had approximately 9,200 employees located throughout the U.S. and approximately 4,200 long-term leased employees. Approximately 1,070 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and there are no material outstanding labor disputes.
 Supporting our people is a foundational value for Flowers. We believe company success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel whose skills, experience and industry knowledge benefit our operations and performance. The company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), Board committees, and management oversee various employee initiatives including compensation and benefits programs, succession planning, and leadership development and diversity and inclusion. 
 Flowers aims to attract a qualified workforce through an inclusive and accessible recruiting process that utilizes online recruiting platforms, campus outreach, apprenticeships, internships, and job fairs.  Flowers also seeks to retain team members by offering competitive wages, benefits, and training opportunities, as well as promoting a safe and healthy workplace. 
 Flowers supports and develops our employees through company-wide training and development programs intended to build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills, including various management development programs, and provides career planning tools. Additionally, we regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our team members on a variety of topics, including, but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and how we can make our company an employer of choice.  The results are shared with our team members and reviewed by senior leadership, who seek to analyze areas of opportunity and prioritize actions and activities in response to the feedback to drive meaningful change in our overall employee experience.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 At Flowers, we believe diversity broadens our perspective as a company and enriches our employees and partners, as well as the communities in which we live. To further develop our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, Flowers has partnered with a nationally recognized consulting firm to aid in the development of a comprehensive strategy to ensure we are continuing to foster a work environment that values all people.  
Health and Safety
 The safety of our team members is a top priority. We strive to provide a safe working environment, and have policies, procedures, and training programs to ensure employees and associates understand and meet safety guidelines. We are currently developing a safety management system that will guide our teams towards a comprehensive, performance-based safety culture that is intended to provide the desired quality of life our employees, associates and their families strive for as we journey toward safety excellence. 
Second Chance Employer
 While Flowers’ hiring practices have never required job candidates to share criminal background information, since acquiring DKB in 2015, the company has been encouraging its subsidiaries to work with local agencies to find qualified individuals within this candidate pool.  Currently, seven of our bakeries are active Second Chance Employers, including our DKB bakery in Milwaukie, Oregon.  The Dave’s Killer Bread Foundation was established in 2015 to inspire other businesses to become Second Chance Employers.  The majority of the directors serving on the foundation’s board are executives of DKB and Flowers Foods.

Total Rewards
 We have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce by providing competitive wages and benefits. Our benefits package includes:
  
• | comprehensive health insurance coverage to employees working 30 hours or more each week;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | parental leave to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | short-term disability to provide wage protection for up to six months;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a tuition reimbursement program; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | a 401(k) plan with generous company match.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, we believe that because employees drive our success, they should share in that success. In addition to competitive wages and benefits, when annual company goals are met, eligible team members at all levels are rewarded with a bonus. Furthermore, in Fiscal 2020, in recognition and support of our frontline workers, we paid a total of $12.3 million in appreciation bonuses to eligible hourly and non-exempt employees, leased labor, and contract workers. These appreciation bonuses are in addition to the company’s annual bonus program.
 Sustainability
 Sustainability is core to our strategy and how we connect with consumers and grow our company. Our leading brands and delicious bakery foods are made with a commitment to operating efficiently, reducing waste, and sourcing ingredients responsibly. 
 As part of that strategy, we recognize our responsibility to uphold the company’s founding values, which for more than 100 years, have centered on working ethically, responsibly, and with integrity. We also look for ways to make a positive difference at work and in our communities. By collaborating with stakeholders, including team members, business partners, suppliers, and customers, we are working to become a more sustainable company. 
 We integrate environmental, social and governance objectives into our decision making to deliver long-term value. In doing so, we consider guidance by our stakeholders and third-party frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).
