Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Games & Esports Experience Acquisition Corp. is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 22, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination.
The Company is sponsored by GEEX Sponsor, LLC (the “Sponsor”), an affiliate of Gamers Club, a gaming technology subscription platform and community hub based in Brazil. Concurrently with our initial business combination, the Company currently intends to merge with Gamers Club. The Company cannot provide any assurance that such a merger with Gamers Club will occur at all, or, if it does, it cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or terms thereof. The Company will not, however, complete an initial business combination with only Gamers Club. We intend to pursue business combinations with interactive media companies operating directly within or adjacent to competitive gaming and esports. We may also consider industries with similar user characteristics or demographics including, but not limited to, ecommerce, media, content and other intellectual property, sports & entertainment, and social media, although our efforts in identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry.
Our registration statement for our IPO was declared effective on December 1, 2021. On December 7, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 20,000,000 units, which included 2,500,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “warrant”), each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $200,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO on December 7, 2021, we consummated a private placement (the “Private Placement”) with our Sponsor of an aggregate of 11,250,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $11,250,000.
Upon the closing of the IPO and the Private Placement, a total of $205.0 million of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s Shareholders, as described below, except that interest earned on the Trust Account can be released to the Company to pay its tax obligations.
On January 21, 2022, we announced that, commencing January 24, 2022, holders of the 20,000,000 units sold in our initial public offering may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the public warrants included in the units on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “GEEX” and “GEEXW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “GEEXU.”

On March 6, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, where the shareholders approved a special resolution (the “Extension Proposal”) to amend the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (i) extend from March 7, 2023 (the “Original Termination Date”) to December 7, 2023 (the “Extended Date”) the date by which, if we had not consummated an initial business combination, the Company must liquidate and dissolve, (ii) allow us, without another shareholder vote, to elect to extend the date to consummate a business combination on a monthly basis for up to nine times by an additional one month each time up to the Extended Date, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadlines, until December 7, 2023, unless the closing of our initial business combination shall have occurred, and (iii) cancel the automatic three-month extension period in the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to which the Company was entitled upon filing a preliminary proxy statement, registration statement or similar filing for an initial business combination during (a) the 15-month period from the consummation of the Company’s initial public offering or (b) any paid extension period, to consummate an initial business combination.
In connection with the vote to approve the Extension Proposal, the holders of 13,639,848 public shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.46 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $142.7 million. As such, approximately 68% of the public shares were redeemed and approximately 32% of the public shares remain outstanding. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our Trust Account was approximately $66.5 million.
On March 3, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Sponsor Note”) to the Sponsor, which provides for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 which may be drawn by the Company and used for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Company’s trust account for each public share that was not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from March 7, 2023 to December 7, 2023. The Sponsor Note does not bear interest and is repayable in full upon the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or the date the Company liquidates the Trust Account established in connection with the IPO upon the failure of the Company to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period.
On March 3, 2023, the Company borrowed $350,000 under the Sponsor Note and deposited $140,000 into the Trust Account to fund the initial one-month extension of the Company’s termination date until April 7, 2023.

See Item 10 of this Report for additional information regarding our management team and our advisors.
We plan to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate interactive media businesses directly within or adjacent to competitive gaming and esports, as well as on the significant experience, reputation and relationships of our management team, directors, and advisors to complete an initial business combination. In addition, our management team, directors, and advisors, by virtue of their extensive operational and transactional experience and through long-standing industry relationships, have global access to the operating, venture capital and financial sponsor communities, providing a key sourcing portal into a pipeline of potential target acquisition opportunities.
Market Opportunity
We intend to pursue business combinations with interactive media companies operating directly within or adjacent to competitive gaming and esports. We may also consider industries with similar user characteristics or demographics including, but not limited to, ecommerce, media, content and other intellectual property, sports & entertainment, and social media, although our efforts in identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry. The competitive gaming and esports market, a large and growing subset of interactive and digital media, has been growing rapidly over the past several years.
Competitive gaming and esports are propelled by strong trends and demographic tailwinds that have further accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, total gaming and esports market revenue was approximately $167 billion and is expected to have a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 13% from 2020 to 2024. In 2021, video game revenue grew to approximately $165 billion, a CAGR of approximately 10% from 2016 to 2021, and is expected to grow to approximately $221 billion in 20251. As viewership and engagement continue to gain momentum with more comprehensive, interactive experiences, the esports market, a subsector of the broader video games market, will become increasingly attractive. Today, the esports market represents approximately $1.4 billion in revenue, and is expected to grow to $1.9 billion by 20252, with distinctive opportunity available to those market participants able to integrate esports with other socially oriented experiences to drive engagement. As gaming and esports continue to become more accessible, with the cost of technology decreasing and high-speed internet becoming more widespread globally, we believe the total addressable market is positioned for several decades of incremental, strong growth. Thus, even as a leading market share position is attractive at the market’s current size, the gaming and esports market continues to grow. Total audience, as well as engagement of the full spectrum of casual to more avid gamers as well as competitive gaming and esports fans, have all shown strong, steady growth trends.
Gaming has more than tipped into the mainstream; it is a bona fide mainstay. For its core and existing users, share of time, wallet, mindshare and passion continue to increase. Gaming is neither exclusively active (i.e., games are not merely “played”) nor just passive (i.e., unlike professional traditional sports or film and television, games are not merely watched)—users engage with games. This engagement, and the diversity of engagement opportunities, has unleashed a tidal wave of creativity and entrepreneurialism in and around gaming, highlighted by proliferation in both game development, exemplified by companies such as Roblox, which offers a creative development platform and has attracted seven million developers across 170 countries as of September 30, 2020; and consumption options, often inclusive of multiple media segments simultaneously, exemplified by Fortnite Battle Royal in-game experiences featuring live concerts with music artists such as Travis Scott and Marshmello.

Equally compelling from a market size or market growth potential standpoint is the emergence of gaming as a utility: gaming is, for instance, now used for educational purposes and increasingly seen as a tool to enable socialization (in stark contrast to how it was previously viewed as an antisocial and isolating phenomena), as currency and as the proverbial “water cooler” of the 21st century. The emergence of education technology companies leveraging gaming as a teaching tool, content source, or means of distribution has increased, as exemplified by Duolingo’s interactive language learning solution. So-called “gamification” is increasingly pervasive in education, seen as a way to aid in the engagement of students in the classroom, and aid cognitive development3. Activate Consulting expects most digital activities, including search, social, shopping and live events, to increasingly take place inside games; indeed, gaming may already be the central hub for people’s virtual lives and, increasingly, their real lives4. As live and digital content continue to fuse, gaming continues to evolve towards and converge into traditional media, evidenced by Netflix observation in their 2018 shareholders’ letter: “We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO.” In addition, gaming and esports users tend to have attractive demographic and/or income characteristics.
However, despite the industry’s attractive growth profile and user characteristics, few competitive gaming and esports assets have managed to reach the necessary user scale that would allow for attractive operating margins or the development of robust, durable business models. Because the user experience is fragmented, causing users to split time among multiple platforms, sites, and services daily, share of user time and wallet are similarly broadly distributed rather than consolidated. Thus, while in total, monetization per user is strong and growing, monetization per user is often small on a per platform basis, with few if any platforms delivering sufficient scale and value to monetize effectively. In 2020, monetization per user for the gaming and esports market was approximately $58. The high fragmentation of revenue in the industry that tracks the user experience undermines the ability to scale associated expenses; asset and functionality fragmentation leads to replicated costs (e.g., central and administrative costs) unrelated to and not commensurate with improved user experience or product distinctiveness and quality. Collectively, these structural issues create friction and pain points adversely impacting users and lead to higher cost, lower margin and less sticky businesses.
We believe the fragmentation of competitive gaming and esports businesses creates a landscape primed for consolidation. Further, we believe that streamlining user functionality within competitive gaming and bringing esports fans together on a unified platform that improves the user experience for all participants will significantly increase the average annual revenue per user in esports, which has grown to approximately $55 in 2018 from approximately $2 per user in 20146. We believe there is significant, attainable opportunity for increased monetization per user, particularly when compared to the average annual revenue per user of $15 for the NBA or $60 for the National Football League (the “NFL”)7. Material cost and revenue synergies may enable a consolidated platform to improve operating margins and benefit from operating leverage, as costs can either be eliminated entirely or scaled across a broader user base with higher revenue per user characteristics. We believe that gaming and esports businesses that are early to market with adequate liquidity and access to growth capital via public financing may be competitively advantaged during this consolidation period.
We believe there is an opportunity for a large, well-capitalized and diverse company with exposure to and touchpoints throughout competitive gaming and esports to emerge as a clear market leader by demonstrating growth and an ability to reach a broader audience, generate scale and capitalize on synergies to expand revenue and profitability. With infrastructure that unifies diversified competitive gaming and esports assets, a scaled platform can become the foundation for additional business combinations to compete in the ecosystem and to return value to shareholders and industry stakeholders (including, but not limited to, publishers, gamers, fans, and even the otherwise non-engaged parents of gamers and fans) in the long-term.

Further, for a SPAC in particular, we believe that interactive media enterprises within competitive gaming and esports represent an attractive and underexploited market opportunity. First, we believe there is a robust universe of potential target companies, nearly all of which will continue to benefit from the dynamic and attractive growth characteristics that have propelled gaming and esports forward as a leading media vertical over the last several years, if not decades. Twenty years ago, gaming was a fairly narrow media vertical serving a casual player base primarily comprised of young adults; today, gaming is larger than the global movie and North American sports industries combined8 and as GenZ reaches adulthood and GenX and Millennials enter middle age and beyond, the age distribution of participants in gaming and esports becomes more diverse and attractive. This is in contrast to many traditional sports in which the average age of fans is increasing without any refreshing of the fan population from younger market entrants. For example, the average age of an NHL fan in 2016 was 49 years old, a one-year increase in average age from one year prior9. Similar trends can be observed in the NFL and MLB, and it is unclear today what might reverse that trend in the coming years. By extension, traditional sport participation amongst children is declining, with 37% of children aged 6 to 12 playing traditional sports in 2017, down from 45% in 200810. At the same time, the fastest growing cohorts in our industry are teens and children, entering the gaming market with high velocity and energy, with up to 91% of people between the ages of 2 and 17 playing video games11. Furthermore, while many traditional sports are experiencing net churn and a reduction in fans across essentially every age cohort, adults are increasingly joining the gaming market. Adults are using gaming as a mechanism through which to socialize or connect with friends and peers as well as their children, phenomena that we believe were accelerated by the recent and ongoing COVID pandemic. A 2020 report released by Global Web Index, for instance, finds that gamers between the ages of 55-64 have grown by 32% over the last three years. Thus, while monetization per user in gaming is expected to increase significantly in the short term, driven in part by players and fans who grew up gaming, have significant discretionary income and make their own purchasing decisions, that anticipated rate of growth is likely to increase even further over the long term as more people consume multiple forms of media within gaming while simultaneously engaging in games in their more traditional, competitive and participatory format.
Acquisition Strategy
The trends identified in the “Market Opportunity” section above are accelerating rather than decelerating; thus, our Company, together with our management team’s knowledge and experience with the broader competitive gaming and esports marketplace can target and acquire a business with strong underlying user and organic growth characteristics and help guide that business towards more robust growth and better operating margins as the market continues to mature and evolve. Having operated, participated in, and advised businesses in this sector, and having worked with investors and other operators approaching and accessing competitive gaming from other nodes in the broader interactive media and entertainment markets, our diligence of target companies will not be limited by the target’s standalone growth characteristics but will also extend to, for example, how the target’s users and customers, functionality, and current and potential value proposition fit within the environment of the evolving gaming and media industry. In other words, market knowledge and new perspective, combined with capital and liquidity, should enable an already strong company to modify or refine its strategic vision to take advantage of the sizable opportunities in the market today as well as tomorrow.
Our combination of industry experience, know-how, and relationships will allow us to pursue an acquisition strategy with multiple opportunities for value creation for shareholders:

● | Identify a target with strong growth characteristics, including indicia related to active and/or registered users, time spent on platform, and engagement, exposed to the powerful growth trends articulated above;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage our gaming platform operating experience to unlock untapped organic growth potential within that target—either through expansion to new markets, integration of new and complementary functionality, or by otherwise enhancing the existing value proposition to both existing users or customers (growing monetization per user or time per user on platform) and potential new users and customers;

● | Further enhance or accelerate growth through the potential simultaneous merger of Gamers Club, as described further below under “—Our Acquisition Process and Possible Merger with Gamers Club,” which Immortals Gaming Club (“IGC”) has owned and operated since December 2018. Gamers Club’s potential inclusion is likely to add immediately complementary functionality, publisher relationships and a performance track record, as well as geographic presence in South America and Brazil, where the target may or may not already have an existing presence; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After the initial business combination, pursuing an ongoing, aggressive M&A strategy to identify various additional targets in the very fragmented gaming and esports sector, which are likely ill-suited, ill-equipped, or simply too small to be publicly listed and may be without the scale and functionality to monetize effectively on a standalone basis, but that can offer significant benefits and value to the day-to-day user experience for our broader user base that seeks deeper and wider engagement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every aspect of our acquisition and growth strategy is characterized by a common underlying theme: relentless focus on improving the user experience. In many ways, gaming is succeeding in spite of itself: users are bounced from game to game, app to app, device to device, group to group, news source to news source, network to network, username to username, with no cohesive and curated experience facilitating improved navigation in and around gaming as a form of media. It is a credit to competitive gaming and esports’s social, cultural and business relevance that the market has grown as it has despite the user experience being what it is.
We think of optimizing the user experience as an imperative and guiding objective, both within the initial target itself (and any potential subsequently acquired and integrated assets), and across, in, and around competitive and engaged gaming and esports generally. We believe that focusing on the users’ day-to-day consumption and known and unknown, stated and unstated needs and wants, and efficiently packaging and delivering that functionality will allow us to pursue a diversified growth strategy, characterized by organic growth, functionality-based and geographic expansion, the potential integration of Gamers Club, and the pursuit of enhancing and accretive targets through strategic M&A.
Focus on a comprehensive and seamless user experience and solution rather than just a linear product to sale transaction will create a flywheel that, with increasing velocity, streamlines and improves user activity and materially increases time spent by users within the Company’s ecosystem. User experience is therefore the driver of increased share of wallet and lifetime value of users, as well as network effect-driven non-linear, exponential growth.
Further, consolidating previously dispersed and fragmented user functionality into a single point of entry enables, for the first time, the creation of a single-identity layer for each user. Frictions that often restrict, limit, or deter deeper engagement or time spent on-platform can be dramatically mitigated through the creation of a secure, single-entry point. This structure will allow for expansion into various incremental verticals of functionality, which could improve the platform’s user experience as described above and making the users even stickier, which should lead to a lower steady-state churn rate.
Fully integrated and at mature scale, key characteristics of an all-in-one platform include four functionality pillars:

● | Follow: read about, or engage with, non-live competitive content related to a game;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Watch: watch live or on-demand content, primarily of a game being played, or game play being discussed;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Converse: actively engage in dialogue about a game, with friends or other users; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Play: actively participate in game play.
--+-----------------------------------------

Each of these pillars represents a critical aspect of users’ gaming activity, with an attractive universe of potential target companies to acquire. At Gamers Club, IGC started by primarily delivering “Play” functionality through matchmaking, but established geographic prominence in Brazil by both diversifying within that core functionality pillar through adding leagues and tournaments to compete in, as well as live stream broadcasts of the leagues and tournaments and by expanding to other functionality pillars both organically with fantasy sports and educational content and through M&A with the acquisition of the Draft5 content platform. Through the combination of these tools and experiences, the resulting customer “solution” that Gamers Club delivers is not some additional code or object; rather, it is a robust community. Gamers Club’s users do not use Gamers Club or consume Gamers Club; they are part of Gamers Club.

6



Our experience in having grown and operated Gamers Club and, in particular, experimented with and deployed each of the functionality pillars both individually and in combination, have helped to provide us with knowledge and perspective about how a user base grows and responds to delivery of broad capabilities within each of the functionality pillars. Our belief is that integrating multiple functionality pillars does not result merely in additional users or customers from each pillar individually (for example, the “Follower” user base (A) is simply added to the “Watch” user base (B), creating total audience of A+B - redundancies); rather, our belief is that network effects drive more than just linear growth as functionality pillars are combined together onto a single platform. We believe this is due to several factors, including but not limited to the user experience, referrals and user promotion, and social activity. Our belief is that additional functionality encourages users to spend additional time on the platform, as users experiment with added functionality, and/or vary their level or degree of engagement with different types of functionality.
Further, we believe that experimentation coincides with users encouraging their friends and colleagues interested in this incremental functionality to join the platform. For example, a user who is initially only playing (not following) may introduce the platform to a friend interested in Follow functionality (not Play), but that may migrate or expand engagement to Play as well once they are introduced to that functionality on the platform. We also believe that both of these hypothetical users (the “Play”—first user and “Follow”—first user) are more likely than not to end up using both “Play” and “Follow” functionality (in part because of their social relationship), as well as others, and to further encourage additional friends and contacts in their respective networks to join the platform. Alternatively, users who already access multiple pillars of functionality from different companies may, if introduced to the platform through any individual functionality pillar, funnel all of their activity onto the one integrated platform that serves all of their competitive gaming and esports needs. As a starting point, each pillar individually has positive and negative attributes which can be enhanced or mitigated as appropriate; however, our belief is that in combination, the complementarity of the pillars together helps to elevate the overall value of the user experience, with powerful network effects as described.
Our willingness to acquire a target whose line of business is within any single pillar or across a combination of pillars enhances the potential target company universe without limiting or constraining our long-term strategy.
We intend to build a central entry point through which competitive gaming and esports users can ultimately access all four key functionality pillars. Our initial business combination may result in a market leading position within a particular pillar, and/or market relevance across multiple pillars. This initial business combination, including the potential merger with Gamers Club (which has relevance across the Follow, Watch, Converse, and Play functionality pillars and a substantial geographic presence in Latin America) will be further augmented by significant investment in organic growth and expansion by expanding to other pillars and/or geographies, as well as through an M&A strategy focusing on acquisitions that similarly improve the user experience or operations of the Company, expand the product offering or geographical footprint, and drive enhanced shareholder value.
We believe that public equity investors will benefit from the introduction of a scaled competitive gaming and esports platform business into the market given the current lack of suitable public market opportunities, which has been driven by the industries’ fragmented nature and lack of standalone scale.
Our initial business combination target selection process will benefit from our management team’s relationships and experience in operating and leading various successful companies in the competitive gaming and esports sectors, as well as our management team’s recent experience in executing a modified version of vertical integration within that sector for Gamers Club in Latin America. We expect to leverage the network of contacts and relationships of our management team, directors and Sponsor, and believe those will be a differentiator in sourcing potential business combination opportunities.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the expected momentum in the competitive gaming and esports industry due to our management team’s distinguished track record of successfully integrating and growing acquired businesses throughout their professional tenure, with acute focus on our core target areas. We believe that the fragmented landscape of competitive gaming and esports companies creates an opportunity for consolidation and value creation for shareholders as gaming becomes more and more ubiquitous in people’s lives as content, sport, activity, and an arena for socialization.
We believe that adoption and growth of the industry, buttressed by a significant and sticky base of monthly active users, will appeal to a broad cohort of investors. Furthermore, we expect that deployment of our strategy will provide considerable upside through combined go-to-market strategies, a unified brand, centralized capabilities, revenue diversification, and financial security through scale, as well as cost savings from centralized back-office functions.

Acquisition Criteria
We will primarily seek to acquire an anchor business where we can leverage our management team’s strategic insight and expertise, experience as operators and acquirers, and its extensive network of industry leaders, all with an eye to drive shareholder returns. We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use the following criteria and guidelines to help evaluate acquisition opportunities, but may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet them:

● | Market leadership position in one (or more) of the four functionality pillars (Follow, Watch, Converse, and Play);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Meaningful presence and/or relevance across multiple functionality pillars (Follow, Watch, Converse, and Play);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large, engaged and/or growing user base directly interested in competitive gaming and esports or with a significant overlap with competitive gaming and esports audience demographics;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Complementary strategy, user base, or functionality set with Gamers Club and/or other potential available future bolt-on acquisitions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong potential for both organic and M&A driven growth in number of active users, time spent on platform, revenue, and/or earnings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to accelerate growth by leveraging our management team’s experience and network;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for access to capital to fund aggressive growth plans;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Suitability for public listing; and
--+------------------------------------


● | Financial profile that can provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant to that opportunity specifically. Moreover, as indicated in the “—Our Company” section, our analysis in identifying a prospective target business, while guided by the principles detailed above, will not be limited to a particular industry.
In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
Our Acquisition Process and Possible Merger with Gamers Club
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. In addition, if we merge with Gamers Club concurrently with or after the completion of our initial business combination, we will obtain a fairness opinion with respect to such merger. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Concurrently with our initial business combination, we currently intend to combine with Gamers Club. The resulting combined company would inherit our Nasdaq listing and its shares and warrants would be publicly traded. We believe the combination of Gamers Club, us and a target business in the competitive gaming, esports, and adjacent industries, including, but not limited to, ecommerce, media, content and other intellectual property, sports & entertainment, and social media, under our Company’s umbrella will allow the resulting combined company to leverage Gamers Club’s existing technology and platform, suite of relevant and synergistic gaming functionality, team of engineers, powerful brand, large community, and established footprint in an attractive and key geographic market to materially aid long-term value creation opportunities for our investors and serve as a platform for further growth and geographic diversification.
Gamers Club Holdings, LLC is the parent of Gamers Club, LLC and is also among the investors in our Sponsor. Gamers Club is a gaming technology subscription platform and community hub based in Brazil with a substantial presence in Latin America that offers a range of competitive gaming-related functionality, including matchmaking, tournament and league play, editorial and news content, and other services. Founded in 2016, Gamers Club was acquired by Immortals Gaming Club in 2018. During IGC’s ownership, Gamers Club has enjoyed strong organic and M&A-driven growth, expanding from one to six game titles; from one to four countries; and added significant functionality to its original matchmaking capability. Gamers Club is currently the second largest matchmaking platform globally, and the largest in Latin America.
At the time of Gamers Club’s original sale to IGC, Yuri Uchiyama, one of four founders of Gamers Club, remained as Gamers Club’s CEO and joined IGC’s leadership team. Working alongside IGC’s leadership (currently the management of our Company and our Sponsor), Mr. Uchiyama led Gamers Club’s growth and expansion, and helped negotiate strategic partnerships and other integration opportunities with companies such as Microsoft and game publishers including Epic Games, for its Fortnite title, Garena, for its Free Fire title, and Riot Games, for League of Legends and VALORANT; among others, enabling Gamers Club to expand quickly beyond its initial footprint in Valve’s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Gamers Club has emerged as a critical lynchpin in the Latin American competitive gaming and esports marketplace, and has become a leader in promoting diversity and inclusion in gaming, such as through its annual Gamers Club Masters Femina tournament.
We have not entered into any definitive agreement with Gamers Club, nor have we agreed to valuation or other key terms and conditions with respect to such a possible combination transaction. As a result, even though we intend to combine with Gamers Club concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination, we cannot provide any assurance that such a merger with Gamers Club will occur at all, or, if it does, we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or terms thereof. We will not, however, complete an initial business combination with only Gamers Club. In addition, we may not consummate a combination with Gamers Club if the target business with respect to our initial business combination is not within the competitive gaming, esports, or adjacent industries. If we pursue a combination with Gamers Club concurrently with our initial business combination, a committee of our disinterested directors will negotiate the terms and conditions of such merger (including the valuation of Gamers Club) on our behalf. Based on existing equity interests in Gamers Club held by affiliates of Mr. Cohen, we would appoint one or more additional independent directors (including Ms. Brodkin, Ms. Moore and Ms. Williams) to serve on such committee of disinterested directors prior to pursuing any initial business combination with Gamers Club. Such committee of disinterested directors would also obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that the proposed merger with Gamers Club is fair to our Company and our shareholders from a financial point of view. Our public shareholders have the same voting and redemption rights with respect to any merger with Gamers Club as are applicable to our initial business combination and described elsewhere in this Report.

Members of our management team, our directors and our advisors directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to their fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, or contractual obligations, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not believe that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
In addition, our Sponsor, officers, directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or, in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

10



Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target and, if applicable, Gamers Club. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. If we merge with Gamers Club concurrently with our initial business combination, we will not include the fair market value of Gamers Club for purposes of satisfying the 80% of fair market value test.
In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
The credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions due to the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The conflict is expected to have further global economic consequences, including but not limited to the possibility of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about economic and political stability. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia which increases the risk that Russia, as a retaliatory action, may launch cyberattacks against the United States, its government, infrastructure and businesses. Any of the foregoing consequences, including those we cannot yet predict, may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our ordinary shares to be adversely affected.
Financial Position
With funds available for our initial business combination in the amount of approximately $66.5 million as of March 8, 2023 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $7,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio.
Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering, the sale of the private placement warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these or other sources as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.
We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.

11



We have 15 months from the closing of the initial public offering to complete an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months from the consummation of the initial public offering, we may, but are not obligated to, by resolution of the board of directors if requested by our Sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination nine times by an additional one month each time for a total of up to 24 months. In the case of any Paid Extension Period, public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares if we choose to make any such paid extension. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement, in order to avail ourselves of the Paid Extension Period to consummate our initial business combination, our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the Trust Account on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline for each one-month extension the lesser of (a) an aggregate of $140,000 or (b) $0.05 per public share that remains outstanding and is not redeemed prior to any such one-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan to us by our Sponsor or affiliate or designee of our Sponsor. Any such time extension funding loans will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Up to $4,025,000 of such time extension funding loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. If we do not complete an initial business combination, we will not repay such loans. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor or its affiliates five days prior to the applicable deadline of its wish for us to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. Our public shareholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such paid extension. As a result, we may conduct such an extension even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support such an extension and will not be able to redeem their shares in connection therewith.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
Sources of Target Businesses
Our process of identifying acquisition targets will leverage our management team’s unique industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network our directors and officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.

12



In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors.
While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by us (other than as outlined below) for services rendered prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees. Any such payments prior to our initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the Trust Account.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. In addition, if we merge with Gamers Club concurrently with our initial business combination, we will obtain a fairness opinion with respect to such merger. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, and other entities that are affiliates of our Sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operation, legal and other information that will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor.

13



Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination and merger with Gamers Club, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments.
Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:

● | solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.

Type of Transaction | | Whether ShareholderApproval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---+----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | ​ | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the Company | ​ | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company | ​ | No 
Merger of the Company with a target | ​ | Yes 

​

14



Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and other reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the Company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
In the event that our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.

15



The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions with respect to our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is currently estimated to be $10.46 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption right will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if our initial business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our Sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after the initial public offering.

16



Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.
If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 7,500,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) of the 20,000,000 public shares sold in the initial public offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity.

17



If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Company’s initial public offering, or the Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
In connection with any vote held to approve a proposed business combination, public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.

18



Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, a public shareholder seeking redemption of its public shares must also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent at least two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete our initial business combination with a different target until the end of the completion window.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we have only until the end of the completion window to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after the initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted completion window.

19



Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer or director, or any other person.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $92,181 from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held outside the Trust Account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the Trust Account to provide us with additional cash to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.25. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.25. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

20



Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the Company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the Company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of the initial public offering will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.25 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.25 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our Company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.25 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.25 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.25 per public share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $92,181 from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held outside the Trust Account as of December 31, 2022 with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our Trust Account received by any such shareholder.

21



If we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.25 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders are entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
Competition
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on March 22, 2021. Our executive offices are located at 7381 La Tijera Blvd. P.O. Box 452118, Los Angeles, California 90045, and our telephone number is (213) 266-7674. Our website address is www.geexcorp.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Report.

22



Human Capital Management; Employees
We currently have two executive officers: Ari Segal, our Chief Executive Officer and Tomi Kovanen, our Chief Operating Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

23



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
