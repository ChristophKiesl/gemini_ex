Item 1. Business
Overview
BioTelemetry, Inc. is the leading remote medical technology company focused on delivery of health information to improve quality of life and reduce cost of care. We provide remote cardiac monitoring, centralized core laboratory services for clinical trials, remote blood glucose monitoring, and original equipment manufacturing that serves both healthcare and clinical research customers.
With over 30,000 unique referring physicians per month, we provide cardiac monitoring and reporting for over one million patients per year, processing over four billion heart beats per day. More information can be found at www.gobio.com. Information on our website or linked to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
BioTelemetry operates under two reportable segments: Healthcare and Research. Our smaller brands are aggregated in the Corporate and Other category. 
The Healthcare segment, which generated 85% of our revenue in 2019, is focused on remote cardiac monitoring to identify cardiac arrhythmias or heart rhythm disorders and to monitor the functionality of implantable cardiac devices. Since focusing on cardiac monitoring in 1999, we have developed a proprietary integrated patient management platform that incorporates wireless data transmission, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) cleared algorithms, medical devices and 24-hour monitoring service centers. We offer cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists and primary care physicians a full spectrum of solutions, which provides them with a single source of remote cardiac monitoring services. These services 
include MCT, event, traditional Holter, extended Holter, Pacemaker, International Normalized Ratio (“INR”), implantable loop recorder (“ILR”) and other implantable cardiac device monitoring. The majority of our Healthcare revenue is derived from the monitoring of devices that BioTelemetry has developed, manufactured and marketed. The Research segment, which generated 12% of our revenue in 2019, is engaged in centralized core laboratory services providing cardiac monitoring, imaging services, scientific consulting and data management services for drug and medical device trials. 
During the first quarter of 2018, as part of the LifeWatch AG (“LifeWatch”) integration, our forward-looking integration and rebranding plans, as well as re-evaluating the significance and materiality of our segments, we aggregated our Technology operating segment into the Corporate and Other category. Included in the Corporate and Other category is the manufacturing, testing and marketing of cardiac and blood glucose monitoring devices to medical companies, clinics and hospitals and corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of our reportable segments. See “Part II; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; Note 18. Segment Information” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussions related to our segments.
Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under our symbol: “BEAT.”
Business Strategy
Our goals are to solidify our position as the leading provider of outpatient cardiac monitoring services, expand our presence in the research market and leverage our monitoring platform in new markets. The key elements of the business strategy by which we intend to achieve these goals include:

• | Increase Overall Demand for Our Cardiac Monitoring Services. We believe that we can increase demand for our comprehensive portfolio of cardiac monitoring solutions by educating cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists and primary care physicians on the benefits of using our services, including MCT, to meet their arrhythmia monitoring needs, stressing the increased diagnostic yield and their ability to use the clinically significant data to make timely interventions and guide more effective treatments. We also believe we can become further incorporated into the medical practices’ workflow by remotely monitoring patients with implanted devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators and loop recorders, and by offering solutions such as the bi-directional integration of our data into Electronic Medical Record systems. 


• | Expand Our Presence in the Clinical Research Market. We continue to focus our efforts on increasing our presence in the clinical research market, diversifying our service offerings and expanding our preferred global provider relationships with clinical trial sponsors. We have experienced an increase in dual-service studies that require both cardiac and imaging service, which we see as a key element of our strategic growth plan. We have had success incorporating our proprietary ePatch™ extended-wear monitor as an element of our new cardiac studies creating cross-segment, top-line synergies. 


• | Leverage Our Core Competencies to New Market Opportunities. We believe our core competencies can be leveraged for applications in multiple markets. While our initial focus has been on remote cardiac monitoring to identify cardiac arrhythmias or heart rhythm disorders and to monitor the functionality of implantable cardiac devices, we intend to expand into new market areas that require outpatient or ambulatory monitoring and management. During the second quarter of 2018, we announced the commercial introduction of our latest generation 

wireless Blood Glucose Monitoring (“BGM”) system, increasing our presence in the large and rapidly growing digital population health management market. This wireless BGM system transmits real-time results to a cloud-based analytical engine, which synthesizes the data, monitors trends and provides caregivers with critical information about a patient’s health status and the potential need to intervene. We have been leveraging our wireless platform and proprietary technology to develop new opportunities for growth in the digital population health management business through key partnerships and internal investments. We continue to evaluate numerous connected health technologies and solutions to better understand where we can best leverage our capabilities.

Healthcare

The Healthcare segment, or BioTel Heart®, is focused on remote cardiac monitoring to identify cardiac arrhythmias or heart rhythm disorders and to monitor the functionality of implantable cardiac devices. We offer cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists and primary care physicians a full spectrum of solutions, which provides them with a single source of remote cardiac monitoring services. These services include MCT, event, traditional Holter, extended Holter, Pacemaker, INR, ILR and other implantable cardiac device monitoring. The majority of our Healthcare revenue is derived from the monitoring of devices that BioTelemetry has developed, manufactured and marketed. 
MCT
Our MCT services incorporate a lightweight patient-worn sensor attached to electrodes that capture two-channel electrocardiogram (“ECG”) data, measuring electrical activity of the heart, on a compact wireless handheld monitor. The monitor analyzes incoming heartbeat-by-heartbeat information from the sensor on a real-time basis by applying proprietary algorithms designed to detect arrhythmias. The monitor can detect an arrhythmic event even in the absence of symptoms noticed by the patient. When the monitor detects an arrhythmic event, it automatically transmits the ECG to our monitoring centers. At our 24/7 monitoring centers, trained cardiac technicians analyze the data, respond to urgent events and report results in the manner prescribed by the physician. The MCT devices employ two-way wireless communications, enabling continuous transmission of patient data to the monitoring centers and permitting physicians to remotely adjust monitoring parameters and request previous ECG data from the memory stored in the monitor. The MCT devices have the capability of storing 30 days of continuous ECG data, in contrast to a maximum of 10 minutes for a typical event monitor and a maximum of 24 hours for a typical Holter monitor.

In 2016, we obtained FDA approval of our next generation MCT device, in a patch form factor. The MCT patch is a four-lead, two-channel system that provides the same best-in-class technology as our traditional MCT devices, in a more convenient form factor. The MCT patch was commercially launched in limited accounts during 2017, with a full launch in the first quarter of 2018. 

Event
Our event monitoring services provide physicians with the flexibility to prescribe wireless event monitors, digital loop event monitors, memory loop event monitors and non-loop event monitors. Event data is transmitted, either through automatic transmission of event data with wireless event monitors or through telephonic transmission of stored event data with our traditional event monitors, to one of our 24/7 monitoring centers where our trained cardiac technicians analyze the data.
Holter

Traditional Holter and extended Holter monitors locally store, on a compact memory card, ECG data of every heartbeat or irregularity. At the end of service, the device is returned. Our trained cardiac technicians then analyze the data. Our next generation Holter monitors, the CardioKey® and ePatch™ are small, lightweight cardiac monitors, which can continuously store up to 14 days of ECG data. 

Geneva

Our Geneva platform is a cloud-based solution for point of care and remote monitoring data that consolidates and manages information from ILRs and other implantable cardiac devices of several manufacturers into a single workflow. When combined with Geneva’s cardiac monitoring services, our trained cardiac technicians analyze and report the data. 

We market our services generally throughout the United States and receive reimbursement for the monitoring provided to patients from government and commercial payors.

Research

The Research segment, or BioTel Research™, is engaged in centralized core laboratory services providing cardiac monitoring, imaging services, scientific consulting and data management services for drug and medical device trials. The centralized services include ECG, Holter monitoring, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, multigated acquisition scan (“MUGA”), a full range of imaging services, protocol development, expert reporting and statistical analysis. Our imaging service offerings were bolstered by our 2016 acquisition of VirtualScopics, Inc. (“VirtualScopics”), a leading provider of clinical trial imaging solutions and services in the cardiac, oncology, metabolic, musculoskeletal and neurologic therapeutic areas. We provide a full range of support services in Phase I-IV trials and Thorough QT Trials, that include project coordination, setup and management, equipment rental, data transfer, processing, analysis and 24/7 customer support and site training. Our data management systems enable 
complete customization for sponsors’ preferred data specifications, and our web service, CardioPortal™, provides access to data from any web browser. Our primary customers in this segment are pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (“CROs”).
In late 2017, we collaborated with Apple, Stanford Medicine and American Well in the Apple Heart Study, to improve the technology used to identify irregular heart rhythms and advance heart science. The study enrolled over 400,000 participants and was expected to discover undiagnosed irregular heart rhythms, such as AFib, using the Apple Watch and dedicated “Apple Heart Study” App.  As part of the study, participants who experienced an irregular pulse received BioTelemetry’s ePatch™ for additional monitoring. In November 2019, Stanford Medicine published its findings, “Large-Scale Assessment of a Smartwatch to Identify Atrial Fibrillation” in the New England Journal of Medicine, which confirmed that wearable technology can safely identify heart rate irregularities that subsequent clinical evaluations confirmed to be AFib. This is an example of a customer outside the traditional CRO or pharmaceutical company utilizing our services.

Other Businesses

The Corporate and Other category contains our other operating business brands: BioTel Alliance™, which focuses on manufacturing, testing and marketing of cardiac devices to medical companies, clinics and hospitals, and BioTel Care®, which manufactures blood glucose monitoring devices and is actively working to expand our position in the digital population health management space. We have been able to build successful customer relationships by providing reliable, quality products and engineering services. We offer contract manufacturing services, developing and producing devices to the specific requirements set by customers.
We manufacture various devices, including MCT, event and Holter monitors utilized by our Healthcare and Research segments. Our facilities located in San Diego, CA, and Concord, MA, are responsible for research and product development under FDA guidelines. Manufacturing of devices is performed in part in our Eagan, MN, facility. We believe that our manufacturing capacity will be sufficient to meet our manufacturing needs for the foreseeable future.
We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the applicable regulatory governing bodies. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, and we successfully completed routine inspections in recent years with no significant findings noted or warnings issued. Our Eagan, MN, San Diego, CA, and Concord, MA, facilities are ISO 13485-certified and registered with the FDA. ISO 13485 is an international quality system standard used by medical device manufacturing companies and is the basis for acquiring European Conformity Marking (“CE Marking”) for medical device product distribution in the European Union. In addition to FDA clearance, many of our devices also carry a CE Marking, which is a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety and environmental protection standards for products used and sold within the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
There are a number of critical components and sub-assemblies in the devices. The vendors for these materials are qualified through stringent evaluation and testing of their performance. We implement a strict no-change policy with our contract manufacturers to ensure that no components are changed without our approval.
Research and Development
We make significant investments in research and development activities focused on developing new products and enhancements to our existing products. We intend to continue to develop proof of superiority of our technology through clinical data. Our aim is to create products that are smaller, faster, more efficient and that provide more useful and relevant information to physicians on a more timely basis. We employ a dedicated internal core research and development team, primarily based in San Diego. We have been consolidating parts of the process across the organization to bring cross-company synergies and benefits. Our San Diego location also houses our rapid prototype lab, which has 3-D printing capability. In addition, we consult with external consultants and partners on certain projects or prototype work.
The three primary sources of clinical data that we have used to date to illustrate the clinical value of MCT include: (i) a randomized 300-patient clinical study; (ii) our cumulative actual monitoring experience from our databases; and (iii) numerous other published studies.
We sponsored and completed a 17-center, 300-patient randomized clinical trial in March 2007 - Steven A. Rothman M.D. et al. “The Diagnosis of Cardiac Arrhythmias: A Prospective Multi-Center Randomized Study Comparing Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry Versus Standard Loop Event Monitoring,” Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology. We believe this study represented the largest randomized study comparing two non-invasive arrhythmia monitoring methods. The study was designed to evaluate patients who were suspected to have an arrhythmic cause underlying their symptoms but who were a diagnostic challenge given that they had already had a non-diagnostic 24-hour Holter monitoring session or four hours of telemetry monitoring within 45 days prior to enrollment. Patients were randomized to either MCT or to a loop event monitor for up to 30 days. Of the 300 patients who were randomized, 266 patients who completed a minimum of 25 days of monitoring were analyzed (134 patients using MCT and 132 patients using loop event monitors).
The study specifically compared the success of MCT against loop event monitors in detecting patients with clinically significant arrhythmias and demonstrated the superiority of MCT for confirming the diagnosis of these types of arrhythmias. The study also demonstrated the advantage of using MCT compared to the loop event monitor in the detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (“AFib”) or flutter. Diagnosis and treatment of AFib is important because it can lead to many other medical problems, including stroke. The study concluded that MCT provided a significantly higher diagnostic yield, in detecting an arrhythmic event in patients with symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia, compared to traditional loop event monitoring, including such monitoring designed to automatically detect certain arrhythmias.
In addition to the aforementioned 300-patient randomized clinical trial, MCT has been cited and referenced in over 40 publications and abstracts, which lends support to its clinical efficacy.
In 2016, we obtained FDA approval of our next generation MCT device, in a patch form factor. The MCT patch is a four-lead, two-channel system that provides the same best-in-class technology as our traditional MCT devices, in a more convenient form factor. We continue to explore unique designs to improve patient experience while maintaining clinical efficacy.
We also continue to research study setup automation and workflow management for use in our Research segment. Our continued efforts to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve our automated patient management tracking in our Research segment services will drive efficiencies, and we believe it will help us acquire more dual-service studies from our partners.
Additionally, we continue to build out our coaching platform for our wireless BGM, through patient and third-party feedback. We are analyzing data to determine where machine learning can provide additional technological leverage and efficiencies to the physician and the patient.
Sales and Marketing
We market our cardiac monitoring solutions in our Healthcare segment through our direct sales force primarily to cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists and primary care physicians who most commonly diagnose and treat patients with arrhythmias. We differentiate ourselves through our clinical efficacy and the seamless integration of our data in the practice’s electronic medical records.
We are the leading member of the Remote Cardiac Service Provider Group (“RCSPG”), with our Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs being the current President of the RCSPG. The RCSPG collaborates with physician specialty societies as well as the American Telemedicine Association to advocate to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and Congress for appropriate valuation of remote diagnostic services that the RCSPG members provide.
We market our Research segment services to pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, CROs and academic research organizations. We are a founding member and the first cardiac core laboratory to join the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium (“CSRC”). Through the CSRC, we are able to network with key thought leaders and decision makers of major pharmaceutical companies, as well as discuss key cardiac safety issues during the drug development process. Through our integration of VirtualScopics, we have experienced an increase in acquiring studies that include both cardiac and imaging requirements. Expanding our research service offerings is a key element of our strategic growth plan, allowing us to more favorably compete for research studies requiring a wider range of research services. Our team has also had success incorporating our proprietary ePatch™ monitor as a critical element of new cardiac studies creating cross-segment, top-line synergies.
Our BioTel Alliance™ brand, currently included in the Corporate and Other category, markets our manufactured products to physicians, hospitals and other cardiac monitoring providers. BioTel Care® is actively working to expand our position in the digital population health space, and continues to evaluate numerous connected health technologies and solutions to better understand where we can best leverage our capabilities. Specifically, we are engaged in increasing awareness and utilization of our wireless BGM and our diabetes management platform. Our commercial team is primarily focused on securing contracted relationships for our diabetes management services with:

• | commercial managed care plans;


• | accountable care organizations;


• | integrated delivery networks;


• | physicians groups;


• | durable medical equipment distributors; and


• | employer groups.

We attend trade shows and medical conferences to promote our various product and service offerings. The trade shows and conferences we attend are related to organizations such as: the Heart Rhythm Society, 
American College of Cardiology, American Telemedicine Association, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology. We also attend the Medica, Drug Information Association and Partnerships in Clinical Trials trade shows, as well as the annual Boston Atrial Fibrillation Symposium. We have had limited product and service-based advertising in certain national newspapers and medical journals.
Seasonality
Our Healthcare segment experiences some seasonality during the third quarter as well as during the year-end holiday season. We believe that this is the result of patients electing to delay our monitoring services during the summer months or holidays.
Healthcare Reimbursement
In the Healthcare segment, services are billed to government and commercial payors using specific codes describing the services. Those codes are part of the Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) coding system, which was established by the American Medical Association to describe services provided by physicians and other suppliers. Physicians select the code that best describes the medical services being prescribed. Approximately 35% of our total revenue is subject to reimbursement directly from the Medicare program, a federal government health insurance program administered by CMS, at rates that are set nationally and adjusted for certain regional indices.
In addition to receiving reimbursement from government payors, we enter into contracts with commercial payors to receive reimbursement at specified rates for our services. Such contracts typically provide for an initial term of between one and three years and provide for automatic renewal thereafter. Either party can typically terminate these contracts by providing between 30 and 180 days’ prior notice to the other party at any time following the end of the initial term of the agreement. The contracts provide for an agreed upon reimbursement rate, which in some instances is tied to the rate of reimbursement we receive from Medicare.
In addition to receiving reimbursement from government and commercial payors, we have direct arrangements with physicians who may purchase our monitoring services and then submit claims for these services directly to government and commercial payors. In some cases, patients pay for their service out-of-pocket.
Competition
Although we believe that we have a leading position in mobile cardiac monitoring in the U.S., the industry in which our Healthcare segment operates is fragmented and characterized by a number of smaller regional service providers. 
Our Research segment competes directly with other core labs as well as CROs that offer centralized core laboratory services. We believe that we compete favorably based on our comprehensive cardiac and imaging service offerings, the scale of our operation and our ability to support the entire life cycle of new drug development.
We also compete directly with other original diagnostic equipment manufacturers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors that impact the success of our businesses include some or all of the following:

• | quality of algorithms used to detect arrhythmias;


• | quality and accuracy of clinical data;


• | turnaround times;


• | ease of use and reliability of cardiac monitoring solutions for patients and physicians;


• | technology performance, innovation, flexibility and range of application generating the highest yields;


• | timeliness and clinical relevance of new product introductions;


• | quality and availability of superior customer support services;


• | size, experience, knowledge and training of sales and marketing staff;


• | reputation;


• | relationships with referring physicians, hospitals, managed care organizations and other third-party payors;


• | reporting capabilities;


• | providing a full spectrum of remote cardiac monitoring solutions, including MCT, event, traditional Holter, extended Holter, Pacemaker, INR, ILR and other implantable cardiac device monitoring;


• | a widening range of clinical cardiac and imaging services and best-in-class solutions;


• | perceived value; and


• | extensive industry expertise.

We believe that we compete favorably based on the factors described above. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive, and the basis on which we compete may change over time. In addition, if companies with substantially greater resources than ours enter our market, we will face increased competition.
Charitable Giving
In recent years, we have supported the American Heart Association through sponsorship and employee fund-raising at local Heart Walk events in the Philadelphia area as well as at various other locations across the U.S. as a way to share a portion of our success.  In 2019, we began our “Heart for Hope” initiative, whereby we committed to fund life-saving heart procedures for children in need.  To date, we have funded 200 surgeries for children from parts of Southeast Asia whose families do not have the resources to do so.  That funding also includes the follow-up care after the surgery is completed.  More information about “Heart for Hope” can be found at www.gobio.com/heartforhope.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop. In addition, we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property and proprietary know-how as trade secrets, and generally require our partners to execute non-disclosure agreements prior to any substantive discussions or disclosures of our technology or business plans. Our business and competitive positions are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our ability to avoid infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others.
We hold patents in the United States as well as many international jurisdictions on our products, processes and related technologies. In furtherance of our overall global intellectual property strategy, we also have patent applications currently on file in the United States and internationally. While we have several patents expiring through 2032, including patents that relate, in part, to our key products, we do not believe such expirations will have a material impact on our ability to compete in the short term since our technology is typically covered by several patents, creating a system of protected technology.
Our trademarks, certain of which are material to our business, are registered or otherwise legally protected in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions and include, among others, the registered trademarks BioTelemetry®, BioTel Heart®, Geneva Healthcare®, BioTel Care®, and BioTel Europe® and the unregistered trademarks Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry™, MCOT™, ePatch™, CardioPortal™, BioTel Research™ and BioTel Alliance™. We also have a significant amount of copyright-protected materials.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry is highly regulated, with no guarantee that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. We believe that healthcare legislation, rules, regulations and interpretations will change, and we expect we will have to modify our agreements and operations in response to these changes.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
The medical devices that we use to provide patient monitoring services are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Unless exempt, medical devices distributed in the United States must receive marketing authorization by the FDA through either a full Premarket Approval (“PMA”) or the Premarket Notification 510(k) process. Based on the classification and characteristics of a medical device, it may receive marketing authorization through a PMA pathway, which requires the demonstration of safety and effectiveness through adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, or receive clearance under the 510(k) pathway after demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device. In addition to marketing authorization requirements, device manufacturers must also comply generally with establishment registration, medical device listing, quality system regulation, labeling and medical device reporting requirements, and any special controls specific to a particular device and used to support reclassification.
The algorithms we use in the MCT service maintain FDA 510(k) clearance as a Class II device. On October 28, 2003, the FDA issued a guidance document entitled: “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Arrhythmia Detector and Alarm.”  In addition to conforming to the general requirements of the FDCA, including the Premarket Notification requirements described above, all of our cardiac related 
510(k) submissions address the specific issues covered in this special controls guidance document. The algorithms we use in the BGM service also maintain FDA 510(k) clearance as a Class II device.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including certain sanctions, such as fines, penalties or injunctions; recall or seizure of our devices and intellectual property; operating restrictions; partial suspension or total shutdown of production; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance of new components or algorithms; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance already granted to one or more of our existing components or algorithms; and criminal prosecution.
CE Marking
Medical devices distributed within the EEA require the CE Marking, which is a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the EEA. The CE Marking is also found on products sold outside the EEA that are manufactured in, or designed to be sold in, the EEA. Although ISO 13485 certification is not a direct requirement for CE Marking medical devices under the European Medical Device Directives, it is recognized as a harmonized standard by the European Commission. ISO 13485 is aligned with the three European medical device directives that are applicable to different types of medical devices in Europe.   Failure to maintain appropriate CE Marking could have an adverse effect on our ability to use or sell our devices within the European Union.
Healthcare, Fraud, Waste and Abuse
In the United States, state and federal laws and regulations restrict healthcare providers from billing and collecting for products or services connected with fraudulent, wasteful or abusive conduct. These state and federal laws include civil and criminal false claims provisions, health fraud and false statements provisions, anti-kickback provisions, physician self-referral provisions, and more, violation of which may subject us to criminal penalties as well as potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs and civil monetary penalties.
Federal and state anti-kickback laws generally prohibit the payment or receipt of anything of value to induce prescription or referral of reimbursed products or services. Stark law limits certain relationships between referring physicians and providers of certain designated healthcare services. Anti-kickback laws restrict financial arrangements with certain healthcare professionals in a position to purchase, recommend or refer patients for our cardiac monitoring services or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under these laws.
Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Violations may result in substantial civil penalties including treble damages, as well as criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The False Claims Act (“FCA”) also contains “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions that allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging false claims and potentially other violations of fraud and abuse laws. Various states have enacted laws modeled after the FCA, including “qui tam” provisions, and some of these laws apply to claims filed with commercial insurers. Violation of federal and state fraud and abuse laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law, and on March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was signed into law. Together, the two measures, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), made fundamental changes to the United States healthcare system. The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility, required most individuals to have health insurance or pay a penalty, imposed new requirements for health plans and insurance policy standards, established health insurance exchanges, changed Medicare payment systems to encourage more cost-effective care and newly expanded tools to address fraud and abuse and required manufacturers of medical devices and other products reimbursed by Medicare to report annually to the government certain payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. In 2018, certain provisions of the ACA were modified and repealed effective 2019 and beyond, and in December 2019, the medical device excise tax was permanently repealed.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was enacted in 1996, amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act in 2009, and implemented through regulation (collectively, “HIPAA”). HIPAA, together with other data privacy and security laws such as the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) in Europe, dictate privacy and security standards governing the collection, storage, maintenance, dissemination, use and confidentiality of individually identifiable patient health information and other personal information. HIPAA applies directly to “covered entities,” which include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and many healthcare providers, who electronically transmit health information and thereby engage in HIPAA “covered transactions.” HIPAA also applies to “business associates,” individuals who perform certain functions or activities for or on behalf of covered entities that require the individuals to create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA is concerned primarily with the privacy of PHI when it is used and/or disclosed; the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI; notifying federal regulators and impacted patients in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI; and the content and format of certain identified electronic healthcare transactions. The laws governing healthcare information privacy and security impose civil and criminal penalties for their violation. Compliance with these laws requires substantial expenditures of financial and other resources for information technology system compliance, maintenance, monitoring, validation and evaluation. Historically, state law has governed confidentiality issues, and HIPAA preserves these laws to the extent they are more protective of a patient’s privacy or provide the patient with greater access to his or her health information. Many states continue to consider revisions to their existing laws and regulations that may or may not be more stringent or burdensome than the federal HIPAA provisions.
Medicare
Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS and its Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MAC”). The Medicare program provides qualified persons with healthcare benefits that cover the major costs of medical care within prescribed limits, subject to certain deductibles and co-payments. The Medicare program has established guidelines for local and national coverage determinations and reimbursement of certain equipment, supplies and services, which are subject to change. The methodology for determining coverage status and the basis and amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the location in which a Medicare beneficiary receives healthcare items and services, the type of items and services provided, and the benefits available to individual beneficiaries.
The Medicare program is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, billing guidelines, MAC contractor local coverage determinations and government funding restrictions. All of these policies may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare suppliers and practitioners, including those paid for our cardiac monitoring or other services. Other regulations such as facility standards, billing requirements, rules of participation and other regulations affecting the provision of and reimbursement for products and services also affect the ability to provide, bill and receive reimbursement for services or products provided under the program. Any changes in federal legislation, regulations or other policies affecting Medicare coverage, reimbursement or eligibility relative to our cardiac monitoring or other services could have an adverse effect on our performance.
Certain of our facilities are enrolled in Medicare as Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (“IDTFs”). An IDTF is defined by CMS as an entity independent of a hospital or physician’s office in which diagnostic tests are performed, often by licensed or certified non-physician personnel, and under appropriate physician supervision. Medicare prescribes detailed certification standards that every IDTF must meet in order to obtain or maintain its billing privileges, including requirements to, among other things, operate in compliance with all applicable federal and state licensure and regulatory requirements for the health and safety of patients; maintain a physical facility on an appropriate site meeting specific criteria; have a comprehensive liability insurance policy of at least $0.3 million per location; disclose certain ownership information; have its testing equipment calibrated and maintained in accordance with specific standards; have technical staff on duty with the appropriate credentials to perform tests; and permit on-site inspections. These requirements are subject to change. Our IDTF facilities are periodically inspected by CMS to confirm our compliance with the IDTF standards, and we believe that our facilities are in compliance with these standards.
Environmental Regulation
We use materials and products regulated under environmental laws, primarily in the manufacturing and sterilization processes. While it is difficult to quantify, we believe the ongoing cost of compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations.
Liability and Insurance
The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices and services of the types we produce entail an inherent risk of liability claims. In addition, we provide information to healthcare providers and payors upon which determinations affecting medical care are made, and claims may be made against us resulting from adverse medical consequences to patients allegedly resulting from the information we provide. To protect ourselves from liability claims, we maintain professional liability and general liability insurance on a “claims made” basis. Insurance coverage under such policies is contingent upon a policy being in effect when a claim is made, regardless of when the event(s) that caused the claim occurred. While, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a material claim has never been made against us and we believe our insurance policies are adequate in amount and coverage for our current operations, there can be no assurance that the coverage maintained by us is sufficient to cover all future claims. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance on commercially reasonable terms in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,700 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

We file electronically with the SEC our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). We make these reports available on our website at www.gobio.com, free of charge. Copies of these reports are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our filings, at www.sec.gov. We do not utilize social media platforms as our primary means of distributing material company information.
