 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  General Information
  
 Noble Roman’s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972 with three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pizzaco, Inc., N.R. Realty, Inc. and RH Roanoke, Inc., sells and services franchises and licenses for non-traditional foodservice operations and stand-alone locations under the trade names “Noble Roman’s Pizza,” “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake,” “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub” and “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs.” The concepts’ hallmarks include high quality pizza and sub sandwiches, along with other related menu items, simple operating systems, fast service times, labor-minimizing operations, attractive food costs and overall affordability. Since 1997, the Company has concentrated its efforts and resources primarily on franchising and licensing for non-traditional locations and now has awarded franchise and/or license agreements in 50 states plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Italy, the Dominican Republic and Canada. During 2016, the Company created a new stand-alone concept called Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub. In recent years the Company has focused its sales efforts on (1) franchises/licenses for non-traditional locations primarily in convenience stores and entertainment facilities and (2) license agreements for grocery stores to sell the Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake Pizza. In 2017, the Company will maintain that same focus and expects to begin to add franchising Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub to its business as well. Pizzaco, Inc. currently owns and operates two Company locations, RH Roanoke, Inc. operates a Company location and Noble Roman’s, Inc. owns and operates a Craft Pizza & Pub location which it intends to use as a base to support the franchising of that concept. References in this report to the “Company” are to Noble Roman’s, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
 Noble Roman’s Pizza
  
 The hallmark of Noble Roman’s Pizza is “Superior quality that our customers can taste.” Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results.
  
   ●
 A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional locations in a shelf-stable condition so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product in non-traditional locations.

   ●
 In-store fresh made crust with only specially milled flour with above average protein and yeast for use in its Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub locations, the first of which opened in January 2017.

   ●
 Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices, parmesan cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes in all venues.

   ●
 100% real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no soy additives or extenders.

   ●
 100% real meat toppings, with no additives or extenders, a distinction compared to many pizza concepts.

   ●
 Vegetable and mushroom toppings that are sliced and delivered fresh, never canned in non-traditional locations and vegetables will be sliced fresh on premises in the Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub locations.

   ●
 An extended product line that includes breadsticks and cheesy stix with dip, pasta, baked sandwiches, salads, wings and a line of breakfast products for the non-traditional locations.

  Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake
  
 The Company developed a take-n-bake version of its pizza as an addition to its menu offerings. The take-n-bake pizza is designed as an add-on component for new and existing convenience stores and as an offering for grocery store delis. The Company offers the take-n-bake program in grocery stores under a license agreement rather than a franchise agreement. In convenience stores, take-n-bake is an available menu offering under the existing franchise/license agreement. The Company uses the same high quality pizza ingredients for its take-n-bake pizza as with its baked pizza, with slight modifications to portioning for enhanced home baking performance.
 Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs
  
 Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs is a separate non-traditional location concept that focuses on sub sandwich menu items but only in locations that also have a Noble Roman’s franchise. Tuscano’s was designed to be comfortably familiar from a customer’s perspective but with many distinctive features that include an Italian-themed menu. The ongoing royalty for a Tuscano’s franchise is identical to that charged for a Noble Roman’s Pizza franchise. The Company has a grab-n-go service system for a selected portion of the Tuscano’s menu in an attempt to add sales opportunities for non-traditional Noble Roman’s Pizza locations.
 Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub
  
 In January 2017, the Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub opened in Westfield, Indiana, a prosperous and growing community on the northwest side of Indianapolis. Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub is designed to harken back to the Company’s early history when it was known simply as “Pizza Pub.” Like then, and like the new full-service pizza concepts today, ordering takes place at the counter and food runners deliver orders to the dining room for dine-in guests. The Company believes that Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub features many enhancements over the current competitive landscape. The restaurant features two styles of hand-crafted, made-from-scratch pizzas with a selection of 40 different toppings, cheeses and sauces from which to choose. Beer and wine also are featured, with 16 different beers on tap including both national and local craft selections. Wines include 16 high quality, affordably priced options by the bottle or glass in a range of varietals. Beer and wine service is provided at the bar and throughout the dining room.
  
 The pizza offerings feature Noble Roman’s traditional hand-crafted thinner crust as well as its signature deep-dish Sicilian crust. New technology and extensive research and development enable fast cook times, with oven speeds running only 2.5 minutes for traditional pies and 5.75 minutes for Sicilian pies. Traditional pizza favorites such as pepperoni are options on the menu, but also offered is a selection of original creations such as “Pig in the Apple Tree,” a pizza featuring bacon, diced apples, candied walnuts and gorgonzola cheese. The menu also features a selection of contemporary and fresh, made-to-order salads such as “Avocado Chicken Caesar,” and fresh-cooked pasta like “Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.” The menu includes baked subs, hand-sauced wings and a selection of desserts, as well as Noble Roman’s famous Breadsticks with Spicy Cheese Sauce.
  
 Additional enhancements include a glass enclosed “Dough Room” where Noble Roman’s Dough Masters hand make all pizza and breadstick dough from scratch in customer view. Also in the dining room is a “Dusting & Drizzle Station” where guests can customize their pizzas after they are baked with a variety of toppings and drizzles, such as rosemary infused olive oil, honey and Italian spices. Kids enjoy Noble Roman’s root beer tap, which is part of a special menu for customers 12 and younger. Throughout the dining room and the bar area are 13 large and giant screen television monitors for sports and the nostalgic black and white shorts featured in Noble Roman’s earlier days.

  Business Strategy
  
 The Company’s business strategy includes the following principal elements:
  
  1. Focus on revenue expansion through franchising/licensing traditional and non-traditional locations:
  
  Sales of Non-Traditional Franchises and Licenses. The Company believes it has an opportunity for increasing unit and revenue growth within its non-traditional venue, particularly with grocery store delis, convenience stores including Circle K franchise stores, travel plazas, Walmart stores and entertainment facilities. The Company’s franchises/licenses in non-traditional locations are foodservice providers within a host business and usually require a substantially lower investment compared to stand-alone traditional locations.
  
  Sale of Traditional Franchises.  The Company has developed the next generation stand-alone prototype for its Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub format. The Company has opened one location as a Company-owned store and plans to open a second location, followed by an aggressive plan to promote franchising in concentric circles from those locations.
  
  2. Leverage the results of research and development advances.
  
 The Company has invested significant time and effort to create what it considers to be competitive advantages in its products and systems for both its non-traditional and traditional locations. The Company will continue to make these advantages the focal point in its marketing process. The Company believes that the quality and freshness of its products, their cost-effectiveness, relatively simple production and service systems, and its diverse, modularized menu offerings will contribute to the Company’s strategic attributes and growth potential. The menu items for the non-traditional locations were developed to be delivered in a ready-to-use format requiring only on-site assembly and baking except for take-n-bake pizza, which is sold to bake at home. The Company believes this process results in products that are great tasting, quality consistent, easy to assemble, relatively low in food cost, and require minimal labor, which allows for a significant competitive advantage in the non-traditional locations due to the speed and simplicity at which the products can be prepared, baked and served to customers.
  
  3. Aggressively communicate the Company’s competitive advantages to its target market of potential franchisees and licensees.
  
 The Company utilizes the following methods of reaching potential franchisees and licensees and to communicate its product and system advantages: (1) calling from both acquired and in-house prospect lists; (2) frequent direct mail campaigns to targeted prospects; (3) web-based lead capturing; and (4) live demonstrations at trade and food shows. In particular, the Company has found that conducting live demonstrations of its systems and products at selected trade and food shows across the country allows it to demonstrate advantages that can otherwise be difficult for a potential prospect to visualize. There is no substitute for actually tasting the difference in a product’s quality to demonstrate the advantages of the Company’s products. The Company carefully selects the national and regional trade and food shows where it either has an existing relationship or considerable previous experience to expect that such shows offer opportunities for fruitful lead generation.

  Business Operations
  
  Distribution
  
 The Company’s proprietary ingredients are manufactured pursuant to the Company’s recipes and formulas by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers. These contracts require the manufacturers to produce ingredients meeting the Company’s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer.
  
 At present, the Company has primary distributors strategically located throughout the United States. The distributor agreements require the primary distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all ingredients necessary to meet the needs of the Company’s franchisees and licensees in their distribution areas for weekly deliveries to the franchisee/licensee locations and to its grocery store distributors in their respective territories. Each of the primary distributors purchases the ingredients from the manufacturer at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturers, but under payment terms agreed upon by the manufacturer and the distributor, and distributes the ingredients to the franchisee/licensee at a price determined by the distributor agreement. Payment terms to the distributor are agreed upon between each franchisee/licensee and the respective distributor. In addition, the Company has agreements with numerous grocery store distributors located in various parts of the country which agree to buy the Company’s ingredients from one of the Company’s primary distributors and to distribute those ingredients only to their grocery store customers who have signed license agreements with the Company.
  
  Franchising
  
 The Company sells franchises for both non-traditional and traditional locations.
  
 The initial franchise fees are as follows:
  
 
Franchise Format | Non-Traditional, Except Hospitals | Hospitals | Traditional Stand-Alone
--------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------+------------------------
Noble Roman’s Pizza | $7,500 | $10,000 | $30,000(1) 
Tuscano’s Subs | $6,000 | $10,000 | - 
Noble Roman’s & Tuscano’s | $11,500 | $18,000 | - 


 
 (1) With the sale of multiple traditional stand-alone franchises to a single franchisee, the franchise fee for the first unit is $30,000, the franchise fee for the second unit is $25,000 and the franchise fee for the third unit and any additional unit is $20,000.
  
 The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are deemed fully earned and non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party.

  Licensing
  
 Noble Roman’s Take-n-Bake Pizza licenses for grocery stores are governed by a supply agreement. The supply agreement generally requires the licensee to: (1) purchase proprietary ingredients only from a Noble Roman’s-approved distributor; (2) assemble the products using only Noble Roman’s approved ingredients and recipes; and (3) display products in a manner approved by Noble Roman’s using Noble Roman’s point-of-sale marketing materials. Pursuant to the distributor agreements, the primary distributors place an additional mark-up, as determined by the Company, above their normal selling price on the key ingredients as a fee for the Company in lieu of royalty. The distributors agree to segregate this additional mark-up upon invoicing the licensee, to hold the fees in trust for the Company and to remit them to the Company within ten days after the end of each month.
 Competition
  
 The restaurant industry and the retail food industry in general are very competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Actions by one or more of the Company’s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses, maintain and renew existing franchises or licenses, or sell its products. Many of the Company’s competitors are very large, internationally established companies.
  
 Within the competitive environment of the non-traditional franchise and license segment of the restaurant industry, management has identified what it believes to be certain competitive advantages for the Company. First, some of the Company’s competitors in the non-traditional venue are also large chains operating thousands of franchised, traditional restaurants. Because of the contractual relationships with many of their franchisees, some competitors may be unable to offer wide-scale site availability for potential non-traditional franchisees. The Company is not faced with any significant geographic restrictions in this regard.
  
 Many of the Company’s competitors in the non-traditional venue were established with little or no organizational history operating traditional foodservice locations. This lack of operating experience may limit their ability to attract and maintain non-traditional franchisees or licensees who, by the nature of the venue, often have little exposure to foodservice operations themselves. The Company’s background in traditional restaurant operations has provided it experience in structuring, planning, marketing, and controlling costs of franchise or license unit operations which may be of material benefit to franchisees or licensees.
  
 The Company’s new Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub format competes with similar restaurants in its service area. Some of the competitors are company-owned or franchised locations of large chains and others are independently owned. Many of the Company’s competitors are large and well-established.
  
  Seasonality of Sales
  
 Direct sales of non-traditional franchises or licenses may be affected by seasonalities and holiday periods. Sales to certain non-traditional venues may be slower around major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the first quarter of the year. The Company’s sales of take-n-bake pizza in grocery stores are typically slower during the summer months, especially when the weather is hot. Additionally, extreme winter weather conditions, compared to the norm for the various regions of the country, adversely affect franchisee’s/licensee’s sales, which in turn affects Company royalties.

  Employees
  
 As of March 1, 2017, the Company employed approximately 26 persons full-time and 53 persons on a part-time, hourly basis, of which 20 of the full-time employees are employed in sales and service of the franchise/license units and six full-time employees and all 53 employed on a part-time basis manage and work the Company-owned restaurant locations. No employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
 Trademarks and Service Marks
  
 The Company owns and protects several trademarks and service marks. Many of these, including NOBLE ROMAN’S ®, Noble Roman’s Pizza®, THE BETTER PIZZA PEOPLE ®, “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake Pizza,” “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub” and Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs®, are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as with the corresponding agencies of certain other foreign governments. The Company believes that its trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to its sales and marketing efforts.
 Government Regulation
  
 The Company and its franchisees and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses. Each location, including the Company’s Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub location, is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, employment, alcohol and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a location. Vendors, such as our third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees, licensees and vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, as well as laws and regulations relating to minimum wage and other employment-related matters. In certain circumstances, the Company is, or soon may be, subject to various local, state and/or federal laws requiring disclosure of nutritional and/or ingredient information concerning the Company’s products, its packaging, menu boards and/or other literature. Changes in the laws and rules applicable to the Company or its franchisees or licensees, or their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
  
 The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing certain specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for additional federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company is subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchised units.
