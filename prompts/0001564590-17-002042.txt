Our customers include substantially all of the leading global telecommunication operators and thousands of enterprise customers, including many Fortune 500 enterprises, and leading multi-system operators (MSOs). We have long-standing, direct relationships with our customers and serve them through a direct sales force and a global network of channel partners. 
 On August 28, 2015, we completed the acquisition of TE Connectivity’s Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) business in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.0 billion. The BNS business provides fiber optic and copper connectivity for wireline and wireless networks. Our results include net sales generated by the BNS business of approximately $1.8 billion and $0.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 During 2016, The Carlyle Group (Carlyle) sold the remaining portion of its ownership of our Company and no longer holds any stock in CommScope.
 As of January 1, 2016, we reorganized our internal management and reporting structure as part of the integration of the BNS acquisition. The reorganization changed the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, we are reporting financial performance for 2016 based on these operating segments: CommScope Connectivity Solutions (CCS) and CommScope Mobility Solutions (CMS).  Prior to this change, we operated and reported based on the following operating segments: Wireless, Enterprise, Broadband and BNS. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the 2016 presentation.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenues were $4.92 billion and our net income was $222.8 million. For further discussion of our current and prior year financial results, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CommScope provides solutions for the core, access and edge layers of telecommunications networks. The core layer is the central part of a network that provides very high-speed services to entities that are connected to the network. The core layer includes data centers, headends and central offices and the high-speed networks that connect them. The access layer connects subscribers and edge devices to the core and includes outside-plant distribution networks.  The access layer typically runs from a central office or wiring center to cell sites, commercial buildings or homes.  The edge layer is the entry point on or off the network. The edge network includes routers, certain wireless base stations and building and campus networks, including single and multi-dwelling unit residences. The table below summarizes 2016 revenue, global leadership position and solutions offerings for our two segments:

Industry Background
 We participate in the large and growing global market for connectivity and essential communications infrastructure. This market is being driven by the growth in bandwidth demand associated with the continued adoption of smartphones, tablets and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication as well as the proliferation of data centers, Big Data, cloud-based services, streaming media content and the Internet of Things (IoT). Telecommunications operators are deploying 4G and fiber optic networks and are planning 5G networks to support the dramatic growth in bandwidth demand. As users consume more data on smartphones, tablets and computers, enterprises face a growing need for higher bandwidth networks, in-building cellular coverage and more robust, efficient and intelligent data centers. MSOs are investing in their networks to deliver a competitive triple-play of services (voice, video and high-speed data) and to maintain service quality.  There are several major trends that we expect to drive network deployments and investment, including:
Evolving Network Architecture
 The pace of change in networking has increased as consumers and data-driven businesses utilize more bandwidth and shift toward ubiquitous mobile applications. Exponential growth in video and “universal mobility” are revolutionizing how we connect to each other and changing the network architecture needed to support consumer demand. This trend requires better network coverage, greater broadband access and increased capacity and data storage. 
 Operators are working to transition their networks to become faster and more efficient. CommScope sees several key network trends that will continue to impact CommScope and the industry during 2017 and beyond:
  
1) | Network Convergence: Operators are moving toward converged or multi-use network architectures. Rather than building upon independent wireline and wireless networks, operators are now shifting toward networks that combine voice, video and data communications into a single, converged network. These changes are expected to help operators increase the efficiency and capability of the network, improve asset utilization and reduce cost. We expect that fiber and wireless technologies will be essential building blocks of converged networks. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Densification: As wireless operators work to meet consumer demand, they utilize three primary tools to increase capacity: a) adding wireless spectrum, b) improving network efficiency and c) increasing network density (i.e., adding more cell sites). Although the Company benefits from all three strategies, densification of cell sites is expected to be a key driver as operators transition toward 5G networks. Densification includes enhanced sectorization at macro cell sites, building new metro-level or small-cell sites and establishing better in-building coverage. The Company expects that densification will require significant fiber connectivity between wireless cell sites.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Virtualization and Centralization: Operators are virtualizing and centralizing wireless networks to make them more flexible and efficient. The first step toward capacity virtualization is deploying centralized radio access networks (CRAN). CRAN is a centralized computing architecture for radio networks which requires installation of direct fiber connectivity to individual cell sites. By leveraging the signal carrying capacity of fiber, operators can centrally control dozens or even hundreds of cell sites in the network. Centralizing independent wireless base stations can support the efficient distribution of capacity, improve network latency, reduce the amount of equipment needed at each individual cell site, and lower power and leasing costs. These CRAN nodes will evolve to become “Cloud RAN” nodes as operators “virtualize” the network by combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a single, software-based administrative entity. Network virtualization also supports the transition to 5G.

4) | Optimization: Deployment of wired and wireless networks is complex and costly. Operators are highly focused on optimizing network resources and reducing the total cost of ownership. Optimization includes techniques such as innovative fiber connectivity solutions to reduce installation time, network intelligence to monitor equipment efficiency, spectrum reuse, offloading traffic into Wi-Fi and utilization of unlicensed spectrum—especially inside buildings.

FTTX Deployments 
 Residential and business bandwidth consumption continues to grow substantially. The proliferation of over-the-top video, multiscreen viewing, cloud services and social media are prompting operators to accelerate fiber deployment. Operators can increase network capacity by installing fiber deeper into their networks. Although consumer devices are increasingly connected to the network via a wireless connection such as LTE or Wi-Fi, these wireless access points must have abundant backhaul capacity available to provide consumers the experience they expect. Operators around the globe are deploying fiber-to-the-node (FTTN), fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) and fiber-to-the-distribution point (FTTdP) to build next generation networks. These networks use the capabilities of fiber to enable consumers access to content at higher speeds with improved response time. As networks improve and deliver higher speed and greater reliability, many operators are choosing to provide both residential and business services over a common physical layer infrastructure, saving them time and money. In addition, with the coming deployments of outdoor small cells and fixed wireless broadband to the home, these same service providers are hoping to utilize this common physical layer infrastructure to provide connectivity to these wireless access points. FTTX deployments in North America are expected to remain one of the largest growth drivers for the industry over the next few years.
 Shift in Enterprise Spending
 Several trends in the enterprise market are expected to create opportunities and challenges. First, the shift toward mobility in business enterprises is expected to impact the amount and type of structured copper connectivity needed over the longer-term. As the bandwidth requirements for Wi-Fi and indoor cellular networks increase, more access points will be needed throughout commercial buildings. As a result, enterprises are expected to adjust in-building cabling designs to deliver both power and high-speed data to those devices. While enterprises continue to need copper connectivity to power edge devices, enterprises are deploying fiber more extensively in both corporate facilities and in data centers. Over the longer term, we expect the ongoing demand for fiber solutions to be somewhat offset by decelerating demand for copper solutions in networks. Due to huge increases in data traffic and migration of applications to the cloud, enterprises are also shifting spending toward multi-tenant (co-located) data centers. In addition, new hyperscale cloud service providers now offer cloud data center services as a replacement to in-house corporate data centers.  
 An increase in average data center size and the number of assets in a data center significantly raises the total cost of ownership and the complexity of managing data center infrastructure. Data center operators strive to manage their resources efficiently and to reduce energy consumption by monitoring all elements within the data center. Automated infrastructure management software helps operators improve operational efficiency, maximize capability and reduce costs by providing clear insight into cooling capacity, power usage, utilization, applications and overall performance. 
 Momentum of 5G
 Although not expected to be standardized before the end of the decade, 5G wireless is evolving from an industry vision toward a tangible, next generation wireless technology. Some operators are already planning for a transition to 5G wireless and have announced trials and pre-standard deployments of 5G technology. The primary uses for 5G are expected to include:
  
o | Enhanced mobile broadband—to support significant improvement in data rates and user experience,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | IoT and M2M communications to support the expected billions of connections between machines as well as short bursts of information to other systems and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Ultra-fast response time—to support applications like public safety, autonomous vehicles and drones.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Densification, virtualization and optimization of the network are all required to support 5G. Operators will need to both acquire and launch new spectrum for 5G, as well as continue their strategy of re-allocation of spectrum from one generation to another.  Some of this spectrum will be at much higher frequencies and will use new technologies to deliver exceptional amounts of bandwidth to subscribers. 5G also requires significant fiber to connect wireless access points to each other to improve latency of the network. As operators transition toward 5G, they must also manage fundamental network deployment issues of site acquisition, power, backhaul and in-building wireless proliferation.
 Metro Cell, DAS and Small Cell Investment to Enhance and Expand Wireless Coverage and Capacity
 The traditional macro cell network requires mobile users to connect directly to macro cell base stations. Macro cells are primarily designed to provide coverage over wide areas and typically transmit high power. They are not optimal for dense urban areas where physical structures often create coverage gaps and capacity is frequently constrained. Adding new macro cells or increasing the number of sectors on existing sites has been the traditional way to increase mobile capacity and will continue to be an important layer of the network. As demand growth continues to outpace capacity growth, new solutions are required for densely populated areas. Metro cells and indoor networks are emerging as important layers of the network.  Metro cells are smaller outdoor cell sites, located closer to the ground, having a lower power level than a traditional macro cell site.  Metro cells blend into their environment and are often found integrated with traditional street furniture, which helps alleviate zoning restrictions that have made traditional deployments difficult. Finally, there are small cell and DAS solutions that address the capacity and speed requirements from an indoor perspective. These systems provide coverage and capacity to the indoor environment and reduce the load from the macro and metro layers, which improves overall network performance. Small cell and DAS systems may range from small single operator, single-band, low-capacity systems for use in enterprise buildings to large multi-carrier, multi-technology, multi-band systems for use in high-capacity public venues.
 Wireless operators view in-building coverage as a critical component of their network deployment strategies. Key challenges for wireless operators in providing in-building cellular coverage are signal loss while penetrating building structures and interference created by mobile devices while connected to macro cell sites. In-building DAS solutions bring the antenna significantly closer to the user, which results in better coverage and capacity while simultaneously reducing interference. In-building DAS provides seamless signal handover for users inside buildings and can support multi-operator, multi-frequency and multi-protocol (2G, 3G, 4G) solutions. Small cells are self-contained radio units that generally provide single frequency and single-provider service to a relatively small area, similar to a Wi-Fi access point. The benefits of small cell technologies are becoming increasingly important with the trend towards mobility in the enterprise market.
 Operators also commonly use traditional DAS solutions to address outdoor capacity issues in urban areas, deploying them in effect as metro cells. By deploying multi-band, multi-technology solutions in this way, operators can create small coverage re-use areas, which optimizes use of existing licensed spectrum by increasing repeated usage of the same frequencies within a defined coverage area.

We provide a broad portfolio of connectivity solutions including fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) equipment and headend solutions for these customers.  Our fiber optic connectivity solutions are primarily comprised of hardened connector systems, fiber distribution hubs and management systems, couplers and splitters, “plug and play” multiport service terminals, hardened optical terminating enclosures, high density cable assemblies, splices and splice closures. These products are used in both local-area and wide-area networks and “last-mile” FTTH installations, including deployments of FTTN, FTTP, and FTTdP to homes, businesses and cell sites. These networks use the capabilities of fiber to enable consumers access to content at higher speeds and faster response times.  
 Our customers are pushing fiber deeper into networks. They are investing in broadband to deliver higher-speed data to homes and businesses; fiber to macro cell towers, metro cells and small cells; and enabling network virtualization in wireless networks. These networks are capital intensive with a high portion of deployment costs related to labor in the field. We are focused on enabling solutions for our customers to build an effective and efficient FTTX network.  With our technological capabilities and diverse portfolio, we can help operators lower capital expenditures and reduce the total cost of ownership by creating solutions that shift labor from the field to the factory. We have a broad, technologically-advanced FTTX portfolio which we believe positions us to capitalize on the expected growth in fiber networks.
 CommScope Mobility Solutions Segment (CMS)
 The CMS segment provides merchant RF wireless network solutions, as well as metro cell, DAS and small cell solutions. Our macro cell site solutions can be found at wireless tower sites and on rooftops. Macro cell site applications represent approximately three-quarters of our CMS segment net sales.  Our metro cell solutions can be found on street poles and on other urban structures. Our DAS and small cell solutions allow wireless operators to increase spectral efficiency and enhance cellular coverage and capacity in challenging network conditions such as commercial buildings, urban areas, stadiums and transportation systems.
 Our solutions, marketed primarily under the Andrew brand, enable wireless operators to meet coverage and capacity requirements for next generation networks. We focus our physical-layer solutions on all aspects of the Radio Access Network (RAN) from the macro through the metro, to the indoor layer. Our macro cell site, metro cell site, DAS and small cell solutions establish us as a global leader in RF infrastructure solutions for wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We strive to provide a one-stop source for managing the technology lifecycle of a wireless network, including complete physical layer infrastructure solutions for 2G, 3G and 4G applications.

 Research and development is important to preserve and expand our position as a market leader and to provide the most technologically advanced solutions in the marketplace. We invested over $200 million in research and development during 2016 and expect to continue with substantial investments in future years. We intend to focus our major research and development activities on high-growth opportunities such as FTTX, base-station antennas, metro cell and small cell wireless deployment and data centers. We are also in the process of developing solutions that support the convergence of wireline and wireless networks in preparation for 5G. Many of our professionals are leaders and active contributors in standards-setting organizations which helps ensure that our products can be formulated to achieve broad market acceptance. 
Customers
 Our customers include substantially all of the leading global telecom operators and thousands of enterprise customers, including many Fortune 500 enterprises, and leading cable television providers or MSOs, which we serve both directly and indirectly. Major customers and distributors include companies such as Anixter International Inc., Verizon Communications Inc., Graybar Electric Company, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Wesco International Inc., Charter Communications, Inc., Ericsson, Inc., T-Mobile, Talley Inc. and AT&T Inc. Other global customers include Vodafone Group, Plc, America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V, Deutsche Telekom AG and NBN Co. Limited. We support our global sales organization with regional service centers in locations around the world.
 Products from our CMS segment are primarily sold directly to wireless operators, OEMs that sell equipment to wireless operators or other service providers that deploy elements of wireless networks at the direction of wireless operators.  Our customer service and engineering groups maintain close working relationships with these customers due to the significant amount of customization associated with some of these products.  Direct sales to our top three CMS segment operator customers represented 17% and 14% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to our top three OEM customers represented 5% and 6% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No direct CMS segment customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 Products from our CCS segment are primarily sold through independent distributors or system integrators. We also sell directly to cable television system operators, broadband operators or service providers that deploy broadband networks. Direct sales to our top three CCS segment customers, all of whom are distributors, represented 19% and 15% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net sales to our largest distributor, Anixter International Inc. and its affiliates (Anixter), accounted for 11% and 12% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

We generally have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers, wireless operators or OEM customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers, and any significant reduction in sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their business with respect to the purchase of and payment for our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 We employ a global manufacturing and distribution strategy to control production costs and improve service to customers. We support our international sales efforts with sales representatives based in Europe, Latin America, Asia and other regions throughout the world. Our net sales from international operations were $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 Patents and Trademarks
 We pursue an active policy of seeking intellectual property protection, including patents and registered trademarks, for new products and designs. On a worldwide basis, we held approximately 10,600 patents and patent applications and approximately 2,700 registered trademarks and trademark applications as of December 31, 2016. We consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, and while no single patent is material to our overall operations, we believe the CommScope, Andrew, SYSTIMAX, HELIAX and AMP NETCONNECT trade names and related trademarks are critical assets to our business. We intend to rely on our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary knowledge, trade secrets and continuing technological innovation, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We will continue to protect our key intellectual property rights.
Backlog and Seasonality
 At December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had an order backlog of $612 million and $572 million, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Our backlog includes only orders that are believed to be firm. Sometimes, unfilled orders may be canceled prior to shipment of goods, but cancellations historically have not been material. However, our current order backlog may not indicate future demand.
 Due to the variability of shipments under large contracts, customers’ seasonal installation considerations and variations in product mix and in profitability of individual orders, we can experience significant quarterly fluctuations in sales and operating income. Our operating performance is typically weaker during the first and fourth quarters and stronger during the second and third quarters. These variations are expected to continue in the future. It may be more meaningful to focus on annual rather than interim results.
 Competition
 The market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We encounter significant domestic and international competition across both segments of our business. Our competitors include large, diversified companies — some of whom have substantially more assets and greater financial resources than we do.  We also face competition from small to medium-sized companies and less diversified companies that have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the markets we serve.

Proven Management Team with Record of Operational Excellence and Successful M&A Integration
 We have a strong track record of organically growing market share, establishing leadership positions in new markets, managing cash flows, delivering profitable growth across multiple economic cycles and integrating large and small acquisitions. Our senior management team has an average of over 20 years of experience in connectivity solutions for the communications infrastructure industry.
 We have a history of strong operating cash flow and have generated approximately $1.2 billion in cumulative operating cash flow over the last three years. Our strong cash flow profile has allowed us to continue to invest in innovative research and development, pursue strategic acquisitions, repay debt and return cash to stockholders prior to our initial public offering in 2013 (the IPO). We continuously pursue strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing our resources, reducing manufacturing and distribution costs and lowering our overall cost structure.
 Throughout our history, we have successfully complemented our strong organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Although we have not yet fully integrated the BNS business, we have already delivered substantial synergies, completed significant system integrations and re-organized the business.  We expect to have substantially completed the BNS integration by the end of 2017.  Our management team has effectively integrated other large acquisitions, such as Andrew Corporation in 2007 and Avaya Connectivity Solutions in 2004.  We have also executed tuck-in acquisitions, such as Argus and Alifabs, to help expand our market opportunities and continue to solve our customers’ business challenges in multiple growth areas. We have also made strategic minority investments in order to gain access to key technologies or capabilities.

Raw Materials
 Our products are manufactured or assembled from both standard components and parts that are unique to our specifications. Our internal manufacturing operations are largely process oriented and we use significant quantities of various raw materials, including copper, aluminum, steel, brass, plastics and other polymers, fluoropolymers, bimetals and optical fiber, among others. We use significant volumes of copper, aluminum, steel and polymers manufacturing coaxial and twisted pair cables and antennas. Other parts are produced using processes such as stamping, machining, molding and pressing from metals or plastics. Portions of the requirements for these materials are purchased under supply arrangements where some portion of the unit pricing may be indexed to commodity market prices for these metals. We may occasionally enter forward purchase commitments for a specific commodity to mitigate our exposure to price changes for a portion of our anticipated purchases. Certain of the raw materials utilized in our products may only be available from a few suppliers. We may, therefore, encounter availability issues and/or significant price increases.
 Our profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price of our raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. Prices for copper, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have fluctuated substantially during the past several years. We have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again. Delays in implementing price increases, failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases, or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.
 In addition, some of our products are assembled from specialized components and subassemblies manufactured by suppliers. We depend upon sole suppliers for certain key components for some of our products. If these sources could not provide these components in sufficient quantity and quality on a timely and cost efficient basis, it could materially impact our results of operations until another qualified supplier is found. We believe that our supply contracts and our supplier contingency plans mitigate some of this risk.
 Environment
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are or may be subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements, could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we do not comply with these laws or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased cost of compliance, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Efforts to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide, have been underway throughout the world which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain environmental laws impose strict and in some circumstances joint and several liability on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. This can have the effect that an entity pays more than its fair share to address such contamination. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and occasionally disposed of at such facilities. Consequently, from time to time it has been necessary to undertake investigation and remediation projects at a few of these sites. There can be no assurance that the contractual indemnifications we have received from prior owners and operators of certain of these facilities will continue to be honored. In addition, we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites, and from time to time we have been and may be held responsible for investigation and clean-up costs at these sites, particularly where those owners and operators have been unable to pay for investigation and clean-up. Also, there can be no guarantee that new environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement or the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which could be material. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016 we had a team of over 25,000 people to serve our customers worldwide. The majority of our employees are located outside of the United States. As a matter of policy, we seek to maintain good relations with our employees at all locations. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements in the United States.  A significant portion of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers’ councils or similar statutory arrangements.  From a Companywide perspective, we believe that our relations with our employees and unions or workers’ councils are satisfactory though we have experienced challenges in certain countries and may encounter more such challenges. Historically, periods of labor unrest or work stoppage have not had a material impact on our operations or results.
