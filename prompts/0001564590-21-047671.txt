Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 One of the original off-price retailers, Tuesday Morning is a leading destination for unique home and lifestyle goods. We were established in 1974 and specialize in name-brand, better/best products for the home. We are known for irresistible finds at an incredible value and we search the world for amazing deals to bring to our customers.
 We are an off-price retailer, selling high-quality products at prices generally below those found in boutique, specialty and department stores, catalogs and on-line retailers. Our customers come to us for an ever-changing, exceptional assortment of brand names at great prices. Our primary merchandise categories are upscale home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, gourmet food, pet supplies, bath and body products, toys and seasonal décor. We buy our inventory opportunistically from a variety of sources including direct from manufacturer, through closeout sellers and occasionally other retailers. We have strong supplier relationships and we strive to make it easy for our vendors to do business with us, so that they will come to us first. Our goods are deeply-discounted, but never seconds or irregulars.
 Our customer is a savvy shopper with a discerning taste for quality at a value. Our strong value proposition has established a loyal customer base, who we engage regularly with social media, email, direct mail, and digital media. 
 With 490 stores across the country as of June 30, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”), we are in the neighborhood in convenient, accessible locations. Our store layout is clean and simple, and the low-frills environment means we can pass even deeper savings on to our dedicated customer base. Our stores operate in both primary and secondary locations of major suburban markets, near our middle and upper‑income customers. We are generally able to obtain favorable lease terms due to our flexibility regarding site selection and our straightforward format, allowing us to use a wide variety of space configurations.
 We operate our business as a single operating segment.
 
COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity and cash flow. On March 25, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our 687 stores nationwide, severely reducing revenues and resulting in significant operating losses and the elimination of substantially all operating cash flow. As allowed by state and local jurisdictions, 685 of our stores gradually reopened as of the end of June 2020. Two stores were permanently closed during the fourth quarter 2020.  In accordance with our bankruptcy plan of reorganization, described below, we completed the permanent closure of 197 stores in the first quarter of 2021 and the closure of our Phoenix, Arizona distribution center (“Phoenix distribution center”) in second quarter of 2021. In addition, as part of our restructuring, we secured financing to pay creditors in accordance with the plan of reorganization and to fund planned operations and expenditures.  
 
Future impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the potential further geographic spread and duration of the ongoing pandemic, the timing and extent of recovery in traffic and consumer spending in our stores, the extent and duration of ongoing impacts to domestic and international supply chains and the related impacts on the flow, availability and cost of products, the production and administration of effective medical treatments and vaccines, and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.
 
Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
 
 
• | In response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on May 27, 2020, we filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). During the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, we continued to operate our businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.

• | On June 9, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving procedures for the closure of up to 230 of our store locations. In early June 2020, in accordance with orders of the Bankruptcy Court, we commenced the process to close 132 store locations in a first wave of store closings. By the end of July 2020, all of these stores were permanently closed. In mid-July 2020, we began the process to close an additional 65 stores following negotiations with our landlords, and those store closures were completed in August 2020. In total, we permanently closed 197 stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In addition, we closed our Phoenix distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

order on December 23, 2020 (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Amended Plan, with certain modifications described in the Confirmation Order (as modified and confirmed, the “Plan of Reorganization”). On December 31, 2020, we legally emerged from bankruptcy, resolving all material conditions precedent listed in the Plan of Reorganization. However, the closing of the Rights Offering was considered a critical component to the execution of our confirmed Plan of Reorganization, therefore, we continued to apply the requirements of ASC 852 – Reorganizations until that transaction closed on February 9, 2021. In connection with our legal emergence from bankruptcy on December 31, 2020, the Company completed certain debt financings and sale-leaseback transactions of our corporate office and Dallas distribution center properties contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. See Notes 1, 2, 3 and 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions on these matters.

• | In February 2021, the Company completed the equity financing transaction contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization with a $40 million rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) that expired in February 2021. Eligible holders of the Company’s common stock subscribed to purchase approximately $19.8 million of shares, at $1.10 per share, with Osmium Partners (Larkspur SPV) LP (the “Backstop Party”) purchasing the remaining $20.2 million of shares. The Company closed on the Rights Offering and in February 2021, recorded proceeds of $40.0 million and recognized a non-cash charge of approximately $14.5 million for a change in fair value of the company’s common stock issued to the Backstop Party. See Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Business Strategy  
 In fiscal 2021, we focused on resetting our merchandise strategy to our heritage of being an off-price retailer. We edited our assortment and drove our merchandising efforts to deliver our customers a treasure hunt and strong values that are representative of the off price marketplace. Additionally, we worked to improve working capital management and inventory turns, and continued to optimize our marketing effectiveness, cost controls and infrastructure.
Competition & Seasonality
 We believe the principal factors by which we compete are value, brand names, breadth and quality of our product offerings. Our prices are generally below those of department and specialty stores, catalog and on‑line retailers and we offer a broad assortment of high‑end, first quality, brand-name merchandise. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including department, discount and specialty stores, e‑commerce and catalog retailers and mass merchants, which sell, among other products, home furnishings, housewares and related products. We also compete in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of home furnishing and houseware products that we sell. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources that may, among other things, increase their ability to purchase inventory at lower costs or to initiate and sustain aggressive price competition.
 Our business is subject to seasonality, with a higher level of our net sales and operating income generated during the quarter ending December 31, which includes the holiday shopping season. Net sales in the quarters ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 accounted for approximately 29%, 37% and 34% of our annual net sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The rate for fiscal 2021 is impacted by store closures during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 
 Working Capital Items
 Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period from Thanksgiving to the end of December. We expect to fund our operations with funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  See Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.  
 Inventory is one of the largest assets on our balance sheet. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers’ demands while keeping the inventory fresh and turning the inventory appropriately to optimize profitability.
 Purchasing
 We provide an outlet for manufacturers and other sources looking for effective ways to reduce excess inventory resulting from order cancellations by retailers, manufacturing overruns, bankruptcies and excess capacity. Since our inception, we have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining first quality, brand-name off‑price merchandise in adequate volumes and at competitive prices. We utilize a mix of both domestic and international suppliers. We generally pay our suppliers timely and generally do not request special consideration for markdowns, advertising or returns. During fiscal 2021, our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 10.3% of total purchases, with no single vendor accounting for more than 1.3% of total purchases. We continue to build strong vendor relationships following our emergence from Chapter 11 and have had no significant supplier issues as a result of the bankruptcy filing.

Low Cost Operations
 It is our goal to operate with a low cost structure in comparison to many other retailers. We place great emphasis on expense management throughout the Company. Our stores have a “no frills” format and we are flexible in our site selection in order to maintain favorable lease terms.
Customer Shopping Experience
 While we offer a “no frills” format in our stores, we have made progress in reorganizing and refreshing our stores to enhance our customers’ shopping experience. We offer a flexible return policy and we accept all major payment methods including cash, checks, all major credit cards, gift cards and digital wallets. We continue to work on initiatives we believe will enhance our customers’ shopping experience.
Distribution Network
 In fiscal 2021, we primarily utilized our 1.2 million square feet of distribution center facilities in Dallas, Texas along with bypass facilities and a network of pool point facilities throughout the country which service all of our stores throughout the United States. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we reached the decision to close our 0.6 million square foot distribution center in the Phoenix distribution center and consolidate operations in our Dallas-based facility, which was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In June 2021, we leased an additional 100,000 square foot warehouse in Dallas, Texas (the “Stemmons DC Facility”) to supplement our distribution network.
 Pricing
 Our pricing policy is to sell merchandise generally below retail prices charged by department and specialty stores, catalog and on‑line retailers. Prices are determined centrally and are initially uniform at all of our stores. Once a price is determined for a particular item, labels displaying two‑tiered pricing are affixed to the product. A typical price tag displays a “Compare At” or “Compare Estimated Value” price, and “Our Price”. Our buyers determine and verify retail “Compare At” or “Compare Estimated Value” prices by reviewing prices published in advertisements, catalogs, on‑line and manufacturers’ suggested retail price lists and by visiting department or specialty stores selling similar merchandise. Our information systems provide daily sales and inventory information, which enables us to evaluate our prices and inventory levels and to adjust prices on unsold merchandise in a timely manner and as dictated by sell-through percentages, thereby effectively managing our inventory levels and offering competitive pricing.
Human Capital Management 
 As of June 30, 2021, we employed 1,607 persons on a full‑time basis and 4,692 persons on a part‑time basis, which is a significant reduction from the prior year due to the impacts of COVID-19 resulting with a reduction in force we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Our associates are not represented by any labor unions, and we have not experienced any work stoppage due to labor disagreements. We believe that our associate relationships are strong, in part, due to the following areas of commitment to a loyal and inclusive associate base: 
Associate Engagement 
 We have an Engagement Committee of which the associate members are diverse from across the organization. The Committee focuses on communication and events to bring our associates together such as ongoing associate events, associate appreciation week, community volunteer opportunities, and charitable events. We conduct periodic associate opinion surveys to directly engage with and collect feedback from our associates, which we use to improve the experience of our teams. Our leadership and human resources department maintain an open-door policy for associates to report concerns, and we provide an anonymous reporting hotline, available in multiple languages. Also, we conduct town hall meetings so that associates can directly hear about the business from senior leaders. We strive to deliver a workplace experience where the quality of our engagement with fellow associates, business partners and customers aligns with our company values.  
Talent Development 
 We utilize an online training and education platform for all associates to be compliant with federal, state, privacy and cybersecurity laws as applicable. We also invest in our store associates through structured training programs for our assistant store managers and store managers that enable our associates to be more effective leaders and helps them strive towards achieving the career they envision for themselves. All associates are given detailed feedback about their performance on at least an annual basis through formal performance appraisals. Based on the associate’s career goals, leaders may work to design individual development plans. Further, the company engages in succession planning to identify and develop talent within the organization.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Associate engagement and retention require an understanding of the needs of a diverse, creative and purpose-driven workforce. We firmly believe that working in a culture focused on diversity, equity and inclusion spurs innovation, creates healthy and high-performing teams, and delivers superior customer experiences. We aim to provide equal opportunity for all employees. As of June 30, 2021, 74.5% of our total workforce identified as female and 43.8% were minorities. Additionally, 50% of our Vice-Presidents and above identified as female. Currently, we are building relationships with organizations, universities, colleges and other networks to expand our reach to potential diverse candidates including a summer internship program at the corporate office that we look to expand to other areas of the business in the near future. 
 We remain focused on increasing the representation of minority talent through hiring and career development by striving to have our stores reflect the diversity in their communities. Our core value of being welcoming to all celebrates our commitment to respect and diversity. Further, the stores offering a diverse range of products creates an inclusive shopping experience.  Our passion for the deal extends to our commitment to providing our customers with a multicultural range of products at a variety of price points. 
 Safety/Health and Wellness 
 We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our associates and customers. Aligned with our values, we strive to continuously monitor our work environment to keep our associates and customers as safe as possible. We have an open door policy for all associates to report concerns or safety issues. If an associate does not feel comfortable reporting an incident to their immediate manager or the human resources department, then the associate may contact the company’s ethics and compliance hotline via a toll free number or access it via the web.  The hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our commitment to associate safety also include ongoing safety communications with weekly safety topics, safety training and audits for review. 
 During fiscal 2020, to address the safety and public health of our workforce and customers due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of protocols, including: 
  
• | Developing and distributing a playbook along with a video to guide the safe return to offices, stores, work sites and implementing temporary work-from home-policies as appropriate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishing strict safety protocols and procedures company-wide, including an in-depth training program, social distancing measures, enhanced sanitization, daily wellness checks including temperature verifications and supplying personal protective gear such as masks and gloves;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we began offering a vaccination incentive program including offering vaccines onsite at the corporate office and distribution center.
  Compensation and Benefits 
 We offer a benefits package designed to put our associates’ health and well-being, and that of their families, at the forefront. Depending on position and location, associates may be eligible for: 401(k) plan and other investment opportunities; paid vacations, holidays and other time-off programs; health, dental and vision insurance; health and dependent care tax-free spending accounts; medical, family and bereavement leave; paid maternity/primary caregiver benefits; tax-free commuter benefits; wellness programs; time off to volunteer, and matching donations to qualifying nonprofit organizations. 
 In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we acted quickly to meet the needs of our team members, by providing certain enhanced benefits, such as: 
 • Created a dedicated associate hotline to provide real time support for any COVID-19-related issues; 
 • Reinforced social distancing through signage, floor markers, taped grid patterns on floors, and directional arrows; 
 • Continued telehealth support and employee assistance programs; and 
 • Provided special wellness resources and tools.

In fiscal 2022, we plan to open approximately eight new stores. We also plan to close approximately eight stores.
 
Site Selection. We continue to evaluate our current store base for potential enhancement or relocation of our store locations. As a result of this ongoing evaluation, we intend to pursue attractive relocation opportunities in our existing store base, close certain stores by allowing leases to expire for underperforming stores or where alternative locations in similar trade areas are not available at acceptable lease rates, and, when appropriate, open new stores. For both new stores and relocations, we negotiate for upgraded sites.  Additionally, we have reviewed all of our leases and renegotiated the terms, with favorable outcomes for many of our leases.  We believe that this strategy will better position us for long‑term profitable growth.
 Store Leases. We conduct substantially all operations from leased facilities, including our corporate offices in Dallas and the Dallas warehouse, distribution and retail complex, which were leased on December 31, 2020, subsequent to the sale and leaseback of those facilities on that date. Our retail store locations, our corporate office and our distribution center are under operating leases that will expire over the next 1 to 10 years. Many of our leases include options to renew at our discretion. We include the lease renewal option periods in the calculation of our operating lease assets and liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will renew the lease. We also lease certain equipment under finance leases that generally expire within 5 years. 
 Store Layout.  Our site selection process and “no frills” approach to presenting merchandise allow us to use a wide variety of space configurations. The size of our stores ranges from approximately 6,000 to 30,000 square feet, averaging on a per store basis approximately 12,400 square feet as of June 30, 2021.  Historically, we have designed our stores to be functional, with less emphasis placed upon fixtures and leasehold aesthetics. With our current real estate strategy, we continue to be focused on designing a very functional, easy to shop environment that also highlights the quality of the merchandise. We display all merchandise on counters, shelves, or racks while maintaining minimum inventory in our stockrooms.

Store Operations.  Our stores are generally open seven days a week, excluding certain holidays. The timing and frequency of shipments of merchandise to our stores results in efficiency of receiving and restocking activities at our stores. We attempt to align our part‑time employees’ labor hours with anticipated workload and with current sales. We conduct annual physical counts of our store merchandise staggered throughout the second half of our fiscal year, primarily when stores are closed.
 Store Management.  Each store has a manager who is responsible for recruiting, training and supervising store personnel and assuring that the store is managed in accordance with our established guidelines and procedures. Store managers are full‑time employees. Our store managers are supported by district and regional level support. Store managers are responsible for centrally-directed store disciplines and routines. The store manager is assisted primarily by part‑time employees who generally serve as assistant managers and cashiers, and help with merchandise stocking efforts. Members of our management visit selected stores routinely to review inventory levels and merchandise presentation, personnel performance, expense controls, security and adherence to our policies and procedures. In addition, district and regional field managers periodically meet with senior management to review store policies and discuss purchasing, merchandising, advertising and other operational issues.
