Arcus strives to create more value through efficiency in mining. The initial expected annual production capacity of fluorite (“CaF2”) for 2020 and 2021 is described below:
 

Type | Metallurgical Grade | Acid Grade 
---------------------------+---------------------+---------------
CaF2 Content | 50% | 80% to 90% | 97% 
Estimated Capacity in 2020 | 30,000 tons | 6,000 tons | 22,000 tons
Estimated Capacity in 2021 | 35,000 tons | 6,000 tons | 12,000 tons
Final Product | Granule | Granule/Powder | Powder 

 
Arcus intends to start producing 97% Acid Grade powder products and further increase the production of the metallurgical grade products in 2020. 
 
Nevertheless, there are several areas where Arcus expects to outperform the market: 
 

· | Abundant fluorite resources for a long-term sustainable business; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Experience in mine construction, mining and marketing of fluorite. 

 
In summary, the Company intends to make full use of Mongolia’s fluorite resource advantages and market under the guidance of our experienced management team.
 
Arcus Company Background
 
The founders and the management of Arcus have extensive experience in the mining industry in Africa, China, Russia and Mongolia. Their industrial experience includes exploration, mining and mineral investment. With extensive experience in the manufacture and sale of fluorite and related products, Arcus believes the Company will be able to produce the raw material needed for various high standard industrial products, including the manufacture of acid grade fluorite, metallurgical grade fluorite and more.
 
To meet ever-changing demands from customers, Arcus established a management team comprised of several experienced persons in the industry, as well as financial and marketing experts from international and local markets. The mines use advanced production equipment to produce high-quality products for the market. 
 
In 2014, the Mongolian Parliament waived several restrictions on issuing new minerals exploration licenses and introduced a series of new regulations to encourage foreign investments in the Mongolian mining sector. Arcus is well positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in this promising business environment.

Arcus Company Structure
 
Arcus indirectly holds three fluorite projects in Mongolia through its wholly owned subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong, namely Best Metro (Hong Kong) Limited, China Aim (Hong Kong) Limited, which in turn wholly own Mongolian based fluorite mining companies Khan Shashir LLC (“Khan Shashir”), Shek Hung Gold LLC (“Shek Hung”) respectively. Arcus Hong Kong Limited wholly own the PRC based Best Metro Import & Export Trading (Inner Mongolia) Limited as a trading arm.
 
The demand for metallurgical grade fluorite in China and other Asian countries currently exceeds supply, and current market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, creating excellent opportunities for the Company. Inherent uncertainties in the mining industry as well as the changing legal and political environment in Mongolia potentially bring additional business risks, as detailed under “Risk Factors” below. 
 
Shek Hung currently owns a project called Altan Ovoo, while Khan Shashir owns the mines Oosmonskogo 1 and Oosmonskogo 2.
 


Mining Licenses
 
The three fluorite projects in Mongolia are Altan Ovoo (“Mine A”), Oosmonskogo 1 (“Mine B”) and Oosmonskogo 2 (“Mine C”). 
 
The three projects have all been issued official mining licenses. The mining licenses allow the right to conduct mining activities throughout the license areas and to construct structures within the license areas that are related to its mining activities.
 
Mine A is located in Uulbayan soum, Sukhbaatar province, 530 kilometers (“km”) from Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Mine A’s mining license, reference number MV-009918, is valid until December 29, 2034. Mine A covers an area of 39.35 hectares (97.24 acres).
 
Mine B is located in the Bayan-Ovoo soum, Khentii province, 440 km from Ulaanbaatar. Mine B’s license, reference number MV-016819, is valid until April 28, 2041. Mine B covers an area of 98.37 hectares (243.08 acres).
 
Mine C is adjacent to Mine B. Mine C’s license, reference number MV-017305, is valid until April 23, 2043. Mine C covers an area of 300.96 hectares (743.69 acres).

Resources and Reserves
 
After years of exploration, a significant potential for high grade fluorite resources for Mine A and Mine B has been positively demonstrated.
 
The historic exploration of Mine A and Mine B can be divided into three phrases:
 

· | An investigation conducted by the former Soviet Union governmental agencies in the last century; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | An investigation conducted by an independent consultant from the United States in 2012; and 
· | An investigation conducted by SRK Consulting in 2014, a leading mining consulting services provider.

 
Arcus’ own geological team will continue to search for other resources through continued exploration in the areas surrounding existing deposits. 
 
Mine A
 
Phase 1: Investigation conducted by former Soviet Union government agencies in 1980’s
 
The former Soviet Union politically governed Mongolia between 1925 and 1991. Its governmental agencies performed the first systematic exploration on Mine A between 1985 and 1987. Only one vein was located, east-trending with a strike length of 600 to 700 meters. The major work performed included drilling and digging six trenches three to four meters deep along the vein.
 
Phase 2: Investigation conducted by an independent surveyor in 2012
 
Since the date of the report by the Soviet Union governmental agencies, 27 new holes were drilled (2,916 m) underneath the trenches excavated in the 1980s to investigate the resource in Mine A. Most holes were drilled vertically or at an angle of 60° to the north, as the vein dips approximately 45° to the south.
 
Phase 3: Investigation conducted by SRK Consulting
 
Considering the advice from the independent explorer on the possibility of re-drilling some core holes to increase output of Mine A and Mine B, Arcus formally engaged SRK Consulting to perform a formal survey on both mines. 
 
In late 2014, a specialist from SRK Consulting visited both Mine A and Mine B. SRK Consulting collected 43 extra drill core samples in Mine A during its visit. The finding by SRK Consulting is at a better grade with an average CaF2 of 34%.
 

6

Mine B
 
Phase 1: Investigation conducted by former Soviet Union government agencies in 1930s to 1950s
 
Former Soviet Union governmental agencies performed the first systemic exploration on Mine B in 1937 and continued until approximately 1950. The main vein located was north-striking. It was traced by trenching and defined to be at least 400 meters in length in the 1940’s.
 
Major work performed in Phase 1 included:
 

1. | Over 160 trenches dug along the vein surface, which are now mostly deteriorated;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Over 35 vertical drill holes; and 
3. | A 35-meter underground tunnel along the main vein zone. 

 
Phase 2: Investigation conducted by an independent surveyor in 2012
 
The Company has drilled 9 vertical core holes with an aggregate length of 877 meters in 2011 to update information on Mine B. Based on the samples obtained from the 9 vertical core holes drilled and assays of 4 drill hole cores in the Soviet Union period.
 
Phase 3: Investigation conducted by SRK Consulting
 
During the site visit to Mine B, the specialist consultant from SRK Consulting observed that most of the fluorite ores in Mine B have a grade of more than 90% CaF2 and could be used for ornamental and lapidary purposes. 
 
Based on the samples taken by SRK Consulting, the average grade of CaF2 is 67%.
 
Mine C
 
No exploration or resource estimate has been done on Mine C, but initial surface investigations suggest that the resource of Mine B may extend onto the license of Mine C.
 
Future development
 
The Company is planning to continue with a second round of exploration in Mine A and Mine B and start a first round of exploration in Mine C. The primary objective would be to gain a better understanding of the geological structure to assist in mine planning and to upgrade the identified inferred resource to the indicated resource category.
 
According to SRK Consulting, the drill holes in Mine A do not provide consistent coverage of all areas. Therefore, another round of exploration would allow a more detailed understanding of the resource allocation and help upgrade much of the inferred resource into the indicated resource category. Full feasibility studies for Mine A and Mine B will be prepared once it’s the right time. These feasibility studies will be conducted by external specialist consultants together with Arcus’ experienced team.
 
Mine C is adjacent to Mine B, and given the large cover area of Mine C, we are optimistic regarding the resources of Mine C. Based on preliminary estimates by the geologists, it is possible that the resource of Mine C could be greater than that of Mine B. Conducting a thorough exploration of the resource will allow better planning on mining Mine C and ensure sustainability of the Company’s growth.
 
Operations
 
Both Mine A and Mine B were in the exploration stage in 2019. Revenue generated during the year were $101,222 by Mine A and $181,635 by Mine B. We expected to further extend the operation of Mine A and Mine B in the second quarter of 2020.
 
There are two types of products available from Mine B, metallurgical and acid grade fluorite. Metallurgical grade fluorite is sold mainly to steel manufacturers for use as flux in steel production. Acid grade fluorite which is used to manufacture hydrofluoric acid, a feedstock for many different chemical processes. At the moment, there is only metallurgical grade fluorite available from Mine A.
 
The Company ran trial productions at Mine A and Mine B in 2019. Below is the summary of revenue for 2019 from the trial productions.
 

Type of Finished Products | Grade Mined | Quantities (In tons) | | Mining Recovery | | Average Price (USD) 
--------------------------+-------------------+-----------------------+-------+-----------------+----+---------------------
Metallurgical Fluorite | Concentration 50% | | 4,418 | | 95 | % | 22.91
Metallurgical Fluorite | Concentration 65% | | 2,221 | | 95 | % | 81.78

Workflow of Operations
 
The operation at Mine A and Mine B of the Company involves several steps as shown below:
 



Mine Preparation
 
Preparing a mine involves investigation, exploration, evaluation and the construction of necessary infrastructures and utilities facilities, among other tasks.
 
Both Mine A and Mine B are now equipped with the necessary facilities, but the infrastructure in Mine B is more comprehensive. The basic facilities information of Mine A and Mine B is shown below:

 | Mine A | Mine B 
----------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------
Water Resources | Drilled water wells | Drilled water wells 
Electricity Resources | Local wind turbine generators | Bayan-Ovoo soum electrical power grid
Mining Method | Open pit mining | Underground mining 
Shafts | Not applicable | 4 in production 

Water Resources
 
It is probable that there is sufficient water from drilled wells for mining and processing operations in Mine A and Mine B. Several such wells have been completed at both Mine A and Mine B. All the water will be recycled, but in the dry climate, evaporation is high.
Electricity Resources
 
Mine B is currently connected to the Bayan-Ovoo soum electrical power grid. Power generation in Mine A is currently supported by a set of wind turbines. Both Mine A and Mine B have sufficient power to meet daily usage, and each has two sets of contingent diesel generators.
Infrastructures
 
At Mine B, the construction of offices, living quarters and explosive stores has been completed. Of the four shafts built in Mine B, one shaft and the other shaft has been excavated with a 150 meter long and 180 meter long development drive in the fluorite ore respectively. There was no vertical development in 2019. Construction on excavating an underground tunnel to connect the four shafts is completed in 2019. 
 
Mining activities are halted for the winter break, which takes place between January and March every year. Since mining activities are conducted underground, which is more dependent on the weather condition, the winter break for the mining activities is one month longer than the winter break for the production line. We have adopted open-pit mining at Mine A which is different from Mine B. Although mining activities are subject to weather, open-pit mining is more flexible so we decided to suspend the mining activities at Mine A in mid-February instead of late November 2019 as we did with Mine B. Production of both Mine A and Mine B is to be continued after the winter break and is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2020.
 
Mine A is planned as an open pit mine because the mineralization outcrops on the surface are relatively easy to begin mining. Four temporary offices and storage containers have been set up at Mine A. Since the resource in Mine A is large, management plans to develop Mine A in stages. Mining of the open pit has been commenced in 2019, while the deeper ores will be subjected to further exploration.
 
Mine A is originally planned to produce fluorite powder. However, in order to cope with our business development, the management decided to put the construction of refinery at Mine A on hold for now. Once it is the suitable time for further expanding our business, the management may resume the plan of the construction of refinery at Mine A.

Mining
 
A strategic open pit exploration at Mine A has been started in 2019. The refinery operations described below apply only to Mine B but can serve as a general reference regarding the future production of Mine A. Starting from year 2019, we have outsourced the mining activities to subcontractors.
Refining
 
The Company will not outsource its core fluorite processing to third parties but rather work together with the strategic partners. Major fluorite processing of metallurgical grade fluorite includes gravity separation, which refines the fluorite granules, followed by sorting the granules by sizes in accordance with a customer’s needs. 
 
The major machines employed in Mine B are the shakers and the jiggers. A jigger is a vertical container where a pulsing action divides ores into different layers according to their densities. When sorted by a shaker, ore is placed on a horizontal water surface, and the shaker applies longitudinal forces. As ores of different densities respond to longitudinal forces, they are sorted accordingly. Both shakers and jiggers are common tools in conducting gravity selection, but jiggers mainly divide coarse ores into different size groups (30 mm - 80 mm) and shakers mainly refine smaller ores (3 mm – 10 mm or 1 mm – 3 mm).
 
Sales and Marketing
 
From 2015 throughout 2019, the mines have still been in exploration stage so the Company decided to sell metallurgical grade fluorite within the territory of Mongolia to avoid incurring cross-border freight and transportation. The Company would like to further expand its production in the second quarter of 2020. Some of the ultimate target customers include foreign steel manufacturers.
Customers
 
The Company intends to develop a pool of customers to reduce its distribution risk. The Company’s targeted customer base is set forth below:
 

· | Korean steel manufacturers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Chinese steel manufacturers; 
· | Other foreign steel manufacturers (e.g., Japanese, Indian, American, etc.);
· | Online sales platforms; 
· | Fluorochemical companies, mainly in China due to large demand; 
· | Chinese and other foreign aluminum manufacturers. 

The Market for Fluorite in Mongolia
 
Fluorite and its Applications
 
Fluorite, commercially termed as fluorspar, is a transparent halide mineral of various colors, composed primarily of calcium fluoride (CaF2). Fluorite is the dominant source for the chemical element fluorine. Due to its unique chemical properties, fluorine is largely irreplaceable in its use. The major applications of fluorite and the corresponding requirement of content percentage are summarized below:
 




Most of the world demand for fluorite is for acid-grade fluorite, which is used to manufacture hydrofluoric acid, a feedstock for many different chemical processes. The second greatest demand is for metallurgical grade fluorite, used as flux in steel and aluminum production. A small portion is produced as ceramic grade fluorite for the manufacture of ceramics and enamels due to the high content percentage requirement.
