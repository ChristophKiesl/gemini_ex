Overview 
 DIRTT Environmental Solutions Ltd. is an innovative manufacturing company featuring a proprietary software and virtual reality visualization platform, coupled with vertically integrated manufacturing that designs, configures and manufactures prefabricated interior solutions used primarily in commercial spaces across a wide range of industries and businesses. We combine innovative product design with our industry-leading, proprietary ICE® Software (“ICE” or “ICE Software”), and technology-driven, lean manufacturing practices and sustainable materials to provide end-to-end solutions for the traditionally inefficient and fragmented interior construction industry. We create customized interiors with the aesthetics of conventional construction but with greater schedule and cost certainty, shorter lead times, greater future flexibility, and better environmental sustainability than conventional construction. 
 Our ICE Software allows us to sell, design, visualize (including 3D virtual reality modeling of interiors), configure, price, communicate, engineer, specify, order and manage projects, thereby reducing challenges associated with traditional construction, including cost overruns, change orders, inconsistent quality, delays and material waste. While other software programs and virtual reality tools are used in the architectural and construction industries, we believe our ICE Software provides end-to-end integration and management, from design through engineering, manufacturing and installation. Our interior construction solutions include prefabricated, customized interior modular walls, ceilings, and floors; decorative and functional millwork; power infrastructure; network infrastructure; and pre-installed medical gas piping systems. We strive to incorporate environmentally sustainable materials and reusable components into our solutions while creating flexible, functional and well-designed environments for the people who will use them. 
 We offer our interior construction solutions throughout the United States and Canada, as well as in select international markets, through a network of independent distribution partners (“Distribution Partners”) and an internal sales team. Our Distribution Partners use ICE to work with end users to envision and design their spaces, and orders are electronically routed through ICE to our manufacturing facilities for production, packing and shipping. Our Distribution Partners then coordinate the receipt and installations of our interior solutions at the end users’ locations. 
 Our name “DIRTT” stands for Doing It Right This Time. DIRTT was incorporated in Alberta, Canada, under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) (“ABCA”) on March 4, 2003. Our headquarters are located at 7303 30th Street S.E., Calgary, Alberta, T2C 1N6, Canada, and our telephone number at that address is (403) 723-5000. Our manufacturing facilities are in Calgary, Alberta; Phoenix, Arizona; and Savannah, Georgia; with an additional facility under construction in Rock Hill, South Carolina. 
 We completed our initial public offering in Canada in November 2013 and listed our common shares on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) in October 2019. Our common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the ticker symbol “DRT” and on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DRTT.”

 Our Solutions 
 We offer a wide array of interior construction solutions powered by technology that address the challenges inherent in traditional interior designing and construction methods. Unlike traditional interior construction, including traditional prefabricated products, our solutions do not have predetermined shapes, sizes or configurations, so clients are free to design any shape, size or configuration that is necessary to meet their needs. Our design and visualization technologies integrate with our manufacturing capabilities and enable short and precise manufacturing times. With a strong network of Distribution Partners, we are able to complete an interior construction project in as few as 30 days, from visualization and completion of design to installation and move-in. Because our solutions remain highly adaptable over time, clients are able to change and customize our solutions even after installation to maintain satisfaction with the functionality and aesthetics of their space as their needs change. 
 Sustainability practices are a core part of our business, from design and manufacturing to installation and beyond. Our solutions are form-fit, so the only waste produced at job sites is packing material, which is biodegradable, recyclable or able to be returned to DIRTT for reuse. 
 DIRTT Solutions 
 Our solutions typically encompass over 90% of an interior space. Walls, doors, cabinetry, access floor, ceilings, power solutions, data networks, heavy timber and medical gas components are all fabricated in our manufacturing facilities and shipped to the site for final assembly and installation. The following table provides a brief description of our primary solutions (together with related complementary offerings, “DIRTT Solutions”): 
 
 
DIRTT Solution | Description

DIRTT Timber | Prefabricated timber construction for interior mezzanines, structural elements for low-rise buildings, and other architectural elements, including completely customized cross-laminated timber and glue-laminated (glulam) timber. 

 
Our DIRTT Power and DIRTT Networks solutions may be integrated with DIRTT Walls, and DIRTT Networks solutions may also be integrated with DIRTT Floors and DIRTT Ceilings. DIRTT Millwork solutions may be added to DIRTT Walls for decorative and functional purposes. Additionally, DIRTT Walls, DIRTT Floors, DIRTT Ceilings and DIRTT Timber may be integrated among each solution. 
 ICE® Software 
 Our manufacturing approach is built on a foundation of technology, the core of which is our proprietary ICE Software. We use ICE to sell, design, visualize, configure, price, communicate, engineer, construct, specify, order and manage projects. ICE enables us to efficiently manufacture fully custom interiors while addressing challenges associated with traditional construction, including cost 
 7


overruns, inconsistent quality, delays and significant material waste. ICE also gives our clients control over the look, cost and timing of their interior construction projects. 
 Clients typically engage an architect or designer and initially design their interior including space planning, materials, colors, finishes, which are then often presented in two-dimensional renderings or a building information model (“BIM”). A Distribution Partner imports this design into ICE and prices projects in real time. Clients can make changes after the design is imported into ICE, which will immediately be reflected in the price quote. Throughout these iterations, clients can explore and walk through their proposed space in immersive and interactive 3D virtual reality, on-screen computer renderings, and floorplan details so they can more readily understand the design. Throughout every stage of the process design changes can be made easily and in real time. We believe this is a significantly enhanced experience for our clients as compared with the experience of reviewing a two-dimensional blueprint or CAD drawing or user expertise intensive BIM file. In addition to the ICE tools that enable these experiences at each of our Distribution Partners, we currently have four specialized virtual reality walk-through centers, including one at our corporate headquarters, that allow clients to use virtual reality headsets to physically walk through a 3D virtual reality model of their design. ICE’s virtual and augmented reality technology, including applications for phones, tablets and PCs, allows project stakeholders in different physical locations to meet in real time to visualize, move about, interact with, discuss and edit their future spaces without having to visit one of our virtual reality walk-through centers. ICE also provides the ability to export a BIM file for use in design reviews of an entire project consisting of non-DIRTT construction elements coming from many different types of software.
 Once the client is satisfied with the design in ICE, the specifications are transmitted to our manufacturing facilities, where the physical product solutions are created to the exact design standards and specifications set forth in the design. ICE’s detailed bill of material data output is key to managing the many aspects of the manufacturing process, including product inventory and cataloguing, price quotation, order submission, parts manufacturing, and production management, thereby facilitating the delivery of custom solutions with shorter production times. We allocate production among our manufacturing facilities based on proximity to the job site and available capacity. ICE’s information allows a project to be tracked in detail across the entire life of the project, from sales, production, delivery, and installation. The ICE file (containing a project’s engineering and manufacturing data) generated during the design and specification process is preserved and can be used for optimizing future reconfigurations, renovations, technology integration initiatives and changes to a client’s space at lower cost than traditional construction methods. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to help clients envision and design interior construction projects and then build and deliver those projects faster, cleaner, more efficiently and with a better overall client experience and satisfaction than traditional construction methods. The modular aspect of our DIRTT Solutions allows them to be easily reconfigured with a minimal amount of waste as client space needs change. Our innovative, technology-driven approach includes outstanding product design that is customized for each client application and delivered on time and on budget. 
 Our strategy is founded on the following priorities: 
  
• | The identification and pursuit of client segments that benefit most from DIRTT’s value proposition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Client-centric, continuous innovation in DIRTT Solutions and our technology to enhance product differentiation and drive market penetration and growth;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ongoing development and support of our Distribution Partners to ensure flawless execution and a superior end client experience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In combination with a focus on cost-discipline, a continuous improvement philosophy, and a focused approach to capital investment, we believe these strategic priorities will drive increased value creation for our employees, clients, Distribution Partners, and shareholders. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following attributes provide us with competitive strengths in the interior solutions manufacturing industry: 
  
• | Leader in Integrated Design and Manufacturing Technology. We believe our ICE Software is the only interior construction technology that efficiently integrates the design, configuration, and virtual reality visualization processes
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with the manufacturing process. The use of 3D technology in a design environment, utilizing video game technology for real time decision making, is an approach pioneered by DIRTT.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy and Intuitive Software Interface. Our ICE Software is a fast, powerful tool with an intuitive user interface. Our software’s ease of use enables rapid time-to-value for our clients and collaboration among all the stakeholders involved in the design, reconfiguration, budgeting and manufacturing processes. Our use of 3D virtual reality and augmented (mixed) reality technologies enables clients to visualize and modify their designs before manufacturing begins, thereby reducing cost and time to completion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary Solutions Components. The physical components that comprise our DIRTT Solutions have been designed to provide clients with numerous options and full modularity. As a result, we are able to create interior environments that are fully customizable and not limited by a pre-set product list. The modular nature of our components allows them to be reconfigured easily, with minimal disruption to the occupants of the space and with minimal job site waste.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Distribution Partner and Sales Network. Our strong network of Distribution Partners and DIRTT sales representatives allows us to maximize our geographic reach, helps build brand awareness in the interior construction market, and enhances our positioning in our target markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Superior Results Compared to Traditional Design and Construction. We believe we produce superior client results as compared with traditional design and construction methods in sequencing, certainty, budget allocation, and outcome.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective Sequencing. Conventional construction generally follows a rigid sequencing process. Typically, wall framing is constructed first, followed by floors and electrical and data networks. This process is then followed by drywall installation, painting, and flooring, and then installation or building of millwork and fixtures. These steps generate significant waste and create opportunities for delay, change orders, cost overruns and rework. In contrast, DIRTT Solutions design and integrate the walls, floors and ceiling, including the finish, electrical wiring and data networks. They are manufactured off-site and arrive on-site organized, labeled and ready to be installed. This enables the interior solutions to be produced concurrently with on-site construction work, thereby reducing on-site time and the overall construction schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Certainty. Our technology-based design and manufacturing solutions address changes in design, communications with clients, and material costs with more certainty than conventional construction methods, which often involve retrofitting electrical and data networks, change orders, uncertain timelines, and costly rework. Our controlled manufacturing environment reduces deficiencies and errors and produces more consistent solutions in predictable time frames.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Budget. Because of our integrated design, visualization and manufacturing technologies, we can price the effect of design choices and changes immediately and deliver the fully designed, manufactured interior solutions ready to install. This provides budget certainty both in the cost of our DIRTT Solutions as well as in on-site labor for the installation process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Outcome. Our interior spaces look like the images our clients expect from the design drawings and virtual visualizations, because those same drawings and visualizations drive the manufacturing process. Plumbing, electrical, A/V and data networks are integrated into the architecture of our DIRTT Solutions. For example, DIRTT Walls carry an aesthetic of permanent walls, but if an IT or facilities team needs to get inside the wall for any reason, they can use a tool to remove the surface of the wall to examine the wall cavity quickly, cleanly and quietly. This eliminates the need to knock down, and then patch and repaint, drywall or reconfigure fixtures and cabinetry. Our modular designs offer flexibility and interconnectivity with any technology, furniture, millwork or DIRTT Solutions that were previously used or that will be used in the future, allowing clients to reconfigure and repurpose their space while reducing disruptive and time-consuming demolition and waste removal.

Distribution Partners and Sales Network 
 We primarily sell DIRTT Solutions through a network of independent Distribution Partners working in conjunction with local DIRTT sales representatives, as well as internal DIRTT industry specialists, business development professionals and a dedicated Distribution Partner support team. Distribution Partners and local sales representatives are located in cities throughout the United States and Canada, as well as in select international markets. The use of a dispersed network of Distribution Partners greatly enhances our ability to drive awareness of the DIRTT brand throughout our markets. 
 As part of our distribution agreements, our 72 Distribution Partners are typically required to invest in their own DIRTT Experience Center (“DXC”) so that they are able to effectively showcase DIRTT Solutions. These DXCs are showrooms that provide 
 9


mock-ups of DIRTT Solutions and related product offerings. As well, DIRTT maintains DXCs in Calgary, Toronto, Chicago, New York City, Savannah, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, with an additional DXC under construction in Dallas.
 Our Distribution Partners operate under agreements that outline sales goals and marketing territories which are generally non-exclusive. We expect our Distribution Partners to build regional DIRTT-dedicated teams (sales, design and project management) and to use our ICE Software in the sales process. In addition to sales and marketing, our Distribution Partners provide value throughout the construction process. At the pre-construction stage, Distribution Partners provide design assistance services to the architect and designer; throughout the construction process, Distribution Partners act as a specialty subcontractor to the general contractor and provide installation and other construction services. Post-move in, Distribution Partners provide warranty work, ongoing maintenance and reconfiguring support. Local DIRTT sales representatives work closely with the Distribution Partners throughout the process to ensure successful project implementation and the highest client satisfaction. Distribution Partners generally place orders for DIRTT Solutions directly with us and pay us directly for such orders. 
 We have the ability to bring on new Distribution Partners in a wide range of geographic areas, which permits us to quickly establish a presence in new market areas. Our Distribution Partners also scale our virtual reality technology, such as our phone- and tablet-based applications, to fit their capacity and needs. 
 At December 31, 2020, we had a total of 72 Distribution Partners and 61 sales representatives across North America. We are not dependent on any one Distribution Partner or sales representative. 
 Manufacturing and Properties 
 Our DIRTT Solutions are manufactured at our facilities in Calgary, Alberta; Phoenix, Arizona; and Savannah, Georgia. Our wall surfaces (which we call tiles), millwork and timber solutions are manufactured in Calgary, while aluminum, glass and power components are manufactured at all three locations. Through distributed manufacturing we can shift production of some components among our manufacturing sites, reduce transportation times and costs, and meet targeted lead times. In 2019, we conducted an evaluation of our aluminum, tile and millwork capacities under various growth scenarios and concluded that the capacity of our aluminum manufacturing facilities is currently sufficient to support our anticipated growth. Given the longer lead time to acquire tile and millwork manufacturing equipment, combined with a lack of redundancy in those manufacturing facilities, we also concluded that we should commence construction of a new combined tile and millwork facility. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a lease for a building located in Rock Hill, South Carolina, which will provide for approximately 130,000 square feet of manufacturing space for the combined tile and millwork factory. We currently expect construction of this factory to be substantially completed and commissioned in the second quarter of 2021. Should the need arise, we have the expansion rights to lease an additional 130,000 square feet of space. Should we experience additional growth, we may need to add or expand additional manufacturing facilities. 
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
 Our inventory balances consist primarily of raw materials, which are kept on hand as components of our custom manufacturing process. Managing our raw material inventory is essential to our business, given our short lead times from order to shipment and our high level of order customization. Our key manufacturing materials are aluminum, hardware, wood and glass. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, aluminum accounted for approximately 30.9% of our purchased materials, while hardware, wood and glass accounted for approximately 14.1%, 11.2%, and 7.2%, respectively. While we maintain multiple suppliers for key materials, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, two suppliers accounted for approximately 28% and 24% of our aluminum supply, two suppliers accounted for approximately 50% and 46% of our wood supply and one supplier accounted for approximately 41% of our hardware supply. 
 Materials are sourced domestically and, to a much lesser extent, overseas. Approximately 97% of our materials are manufactured and purchased in North America. Purchase decisions are made on the basis of cost, quality and ability to meet delivery requirements. We do not typically enter into long-term agreements with suppliers. In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all our operations, although aluminum purchases may be subject to market capacity constraints. 
 Technology and Development 
 We continue to focus on developing client-centric innovations and enhancements of both ICE Software and DIRTT Solutions with a primary focus on improving client experience, increasing market penetration and growing key markets. At December 31, 2020, we employed 105 employees within our technology and development groups and, including capitalized amounts, invested $11.6 million, $11.3 million and $9.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in innovation activities.

Clients 
 DIRTT’s principal geographic markets are the United States, Canada, and, to a more limited extent, select international markets. Our revenue is derived almost entirely from projects in North America sold by our North American Distribution Partners. 
 Our revenue opportunities primarily come from commercial projects, including both new construction projects and renovations of existing buildings. Clients range from small owner-managed businesses to multinational Fortune 500 companies across a variety of industries, including healthcare, education, financial services, government and military, manufacturing, non-profit, energy, professional services, retail, technology and hospitality. We view DIRTT Solutions as generally industry agnostic, with applications in many different industries with minimal adjustments. We are not dependent on any one client or industry segment. No single client represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. 
 Competition 
 The overall market for interior construction is fragmented and highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the interior construction industry include price (including cost certainty), speed, quality, customization and service. Our main competitors are comprised primarily of conventional construction firms, individual tradespeople (including framers, drywall installers, and interior product designers) and modular systems manufacturers. Additionally, conventional construction firms are beginning to develop customizable wall paneling and other interior construction solutions and may directly compete with our DIRTT Solutions. We also compete with commercial furniture manufacturers, such as Teknion Corporation, Haworth Inc. and Allsteel Inc., who offer a variety of prefabricated interior wall solutions. We expect competition to increase as new entrants or solutions enter the interior construction market. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
Seasonality 
 The construction industry has also historically experienced seasonal slowdowns related to winter weather conditions and holiday schedules, which affect shipping and on-site installation dates, in the fourth and first quarters of each calendar year. Our business has generally, but not always, followed this trend with a slight time lag, leading to stronger sales in the second half of the year versus the first half. Weather factors can also influence third-party exterior construction schedules and site conditions, which may in turn affect timing of interior renovations. 
 Due to the fixed nature of certain of our manufacturing costs, such as our facilities leases and related indirect operating costs, periods of higher revenue volume tend to generate higher gross profit and operating income margins while periods of lower volume tend to result in lower gross profit and operating income margins. Quarters that contain consistent monthly manufacturing volumes tend to generate higher gross profit than those where manufacturing levels vary significantly from month to month. 
 Patent and Intellectual Property Rights 
 Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights relating to our products, production processes, our technology, including our ICE Software, and other operations. We rely on a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as patent, copyright and trademark laws, to protect our proprietary rights and competitive advantage. We register our patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate and take measures to defend patents where we deem others are infringing on our patents. The following table presents the status as of December 31, 2020 of our issued and pending patents relating to various aspects of DIRTT Solutions and ICE Software: 

 | Granted | | Applications
--------------------------+---------+-----+-------------
Jurisdiction | Patents | | Pending 
Canada | | 63 | | 41 
United States | | 108 | | 21 
European Union | | 40 | | 34 
Singapore | | 21 | | 5 
Patent Cooperation Treaty | | - | | 14 
Other | | 57 | | 4 
Total | | 289 | | 119

 
Our issued patents expire between 2021 and 2039. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we develop innovations and new technology, we expect to file additional and supplemental patents to protect our rights in those innovations and new technology.

Sustainability and Environmental Matters 
 Conventional construction typically generates substantial waste. According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2018 Fact Sheet, approximately 189 million tons of building construction and demolition waste was generated in 2018, approximately 30% of which was related to wood products, drywall and plasters. Imprecise calculations or last-minute design changes may result in excess materials on the job site, such as wiring, drywall, wood, paint and flooring, that are sometimes unable to be reused or recycled. Measuring and cutting materials on-site leads to scrap waste that generally is sent to landfills. Sustainability is an integral component of our corporate brand identity and DIRTT Solutions. DIRTT Solutions are designed for disassembly, are form-fit and allow for less materials waste throughout the manufacturing and installation process. We integrate environmentally friendly elements into our business wherever possible, including utilizing solar energy at most of our factories to offset a portion of the cost of electricity and the environmental impact of our operations, and utilizing materials with high recycled content in our DIRTT Solutions. We also ship DIRTT Solutions with recyclable or reusable packing and shipping materials. 
 The adoption of environmentally responsible building codes and standards, such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council, also has the potential to increase demand for products, systems and services that contribute to building sustainable spaces. All of our DIRTT Solutions can contribute to the award of LEED credits and other green building rating systems. We continue to develop new products, systems and services to address market demand for products that enable construction of buildings that require fewer natural resources to build, operate and maintain. Our EnzoTM line of wall components received the Canadian Green Building Council’s Green Building Product of the Year Award in 2015 due to its ingenuity and application, particularly as a benefit to healthcare facilities. With the help of Climate Earth Inc., in 2014 DIRTT was the first modular wall manufacturer to complete a full scope Life Cycle Assessment, resulting in 15 Environmental Product Declarations. In May 2019, we completed our second Life Cycle Assessment and released updated Environmental Product Declarations. 
Government Regulations 
 The operation of our business is subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of various manufacturing facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state, provincial and local levels in both the United States and Canada. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigative or remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders limiting current or future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or industrial wastes have been mismanaged or otherwise released. 
 While we do not believe that compliance with federal, state, provincial or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations, we cannot provide any assurances that future events, such as changes in existing laws or regulations, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions related to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs. 
 Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 
 We may be involved from time to time in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with Distribution Partners, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. We may, for example, be a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and claims under other allegations, including claims from our employees either individually or collectively. We do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. For additional information regarding our current legal proceedings, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) enacted in April 2012. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include: 

• | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 
  
• | the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1 million) or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates (or public float) exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter in our prior fiscal year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, DIRTT employed 1,013 employees, 98% full time, 2% part time. We had 1,013 full-time employees consisting of 606 employees in production, 115 employees in sales and marketing, 105 employees in technology and development, 102 employees in operations support, and 85 general and administrative employees. At year-end, approximately 54% of our workforce are salaried employees and approximately 46% are compensated on an hourly basis. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 32% of our workforce was based in the United States, and approximately 68% was based on Canada. Our 2020 hiring efforts were directed towards both our manufacturing and non- manufacturing functions. This reflects the build out of our commercial organization, accounting for 30% of our new hires, and streamlining our operations space, accounting for 55% of our hiring activities. The Company’s recent gender diversity data shows that 28% of our employees are female company wide. In 2020 we hired 175 employees, with 41% of new employees being female.  
Diversity & Inclusion
 DIRTT recognizes the importance of progressing conversations and initiatives around diversity and inclusion. “Grow through diversity” is one of our core values. Our strategy encompasses leadership training around key topics related to unconscious bias, allyship and the value of attracting and retaining a diverse and inclusive organization.  The strategy further focuses on the establishment and deployment of learning streams, mentoring circles, incorporating inclusive language into our offer packages and benefit materials, and the implementation of a diversity counsel.  Our efforts begin at the early stages of the employee life cycle, where diversity candidates are highlighted and presented to hiring managers for review.  We seek to hire based on talent and skill / capability needs and fit.  DIRTT has also incorporated diversity into various internal programs including succession planning and risk profiles.  
Culture & Engagement
 DIRTT has put new measures in place to assess and enhance the level of engagement and satisfaction of our employees.  Specific activities include the deployment of a performance management tool, catered to drive discussions around team goals, performance and development opportunities, and greater transparency around policy and procedures, tied to cost and risk mitigation.  
 
In the second quarter of 2020 we deployed our first company-wide engagement survey focused on core themes of meaningful work, supportive management, positive work environment, growth opportunity, trust in leadership and mental health awareness.

Targeted initiatives were put in place company wide to assess the progression of themes from the survey on overall employee engagement and experience. Results from the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated an average positive increase of 4% enhancement of employee engagement through a variety of targeted measures.  
 
Additional initiatives that we attribute to the progression of culture and engagement include launching learning and development opportunities, enhanced communication platforms, employee recognition programs, and a company-wide philanthropic organization.  
 
Connecting to our community is a critical piece of the DIRTT story. Re-establishing a stronger corporate social responsibility program that demonstrates our drive to put community at the center of the business was a focus area in the third quarter of 2020. This involved developing a strategy, carving out a roadmap of initiatives and establishing a committee of 20 employees across the organization. As part of our strategy we are focusing our efforts on establishing meaningful engagement opportunities, creating inclusive giving campaigns, driving sustainable impact and enabling our employees to connect on philanthropic efforts. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we kicked off our 2020 holiday giving campaign which was a coordinated virtual effort in support of foodbanks across North America. The support for this campaign helped to reconnect DIRTT employees’ desire to give back with tangible outcomes for their communities.  
 Our core commitment to organizational safety resulted in a total recordable incident rate (“TRIF”) of 0.48 in 2020, more than 75% below the industry average and a significant improvement from 4.9 TRIF in 2019. Our enhanced safety protocols and robust contact tracing have been effective thus far in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 infections within our facilities and have helped us to avoid any material production disruptions.
 We use a range of compensation incentives which vary by role, including: annual variable compensation determined based on a combination of achieving team objectives and financial targets for the Company; quarterly bonuses paid on adherence to targets related to safety, quality, delivery, inventory and productivity; and commissions based on sales goals. We also use various forms of stock-based compensation as a retention tool and to further align employee interests with the interests of our shareholders. We monitor our retention by way of voluntary turnover, which was 14% in 2020.
 In response to the COVID 19 pandemic, DIRTT established a business continuity and response committee to develop robust
 company-wide COVID-19 protocols and guidelines. The committee has prepared easily accessible COVID-19 guidelines for all areas
 of the business, including manufacturing, travel, client tours and day-to-day operations. In addition, we have established protocols for
 reporting and contact tracing, and have limited access to our facilities, offices and other spaces to essential operations to minimize the
 risk of exposure to COVID-19. We have also implemented enhanced cleaning protocols, increased signage, shift rotations in
 cafeterias, limited headcounts in conference and meeting rooms, adopted policies with respect to essential workers, and work-from home guidelines and best practices, including ergonomics. In addition, we have taken measures to address the mental health of our
 employees through a variety of company-wide initiatives. We also provide personal protective equipment to all of our employees, and
 to clients that are engaged in essential tours. We have established a safety champions committee responsible for ensuring any
 employee or visitor coming into our spaces is briefed on our COVID-19 protocols and guidelines. Lastly, we have implemented an app for reserving workspaces to help our employees adhere to our social distancing protocols, provide for greater support of contact tracing and ensure we adhere to capacity levels that will help us maintain safety protocols related to COVID-19. 
 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced labor-related work stoppages or strikes, and we believe we currently have a positive relationship with our employees.
