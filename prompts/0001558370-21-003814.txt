ITEM 1. Business
​
Overview
Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc.is a leading streaming video-on-demand (VOD) company. We operate Crackle Plus, a portfolio of ad-supported and subscription-based VOD networks, Screen Media, a subsidiary that acquires and distributes content, and a number of affiliates that produce and co-produce original content. 
​
Crackle Plus is comprised of unique networks, each delivering popular and original premium content focused on different themes such as family, kids, horror and comedy. Crackle Plus brands include Crackle, among the most watched ad-supported independent VOD networks, Popcornflix, Popcornflix Kids, Truli, Pivotshare, Españolflix and FrightPix. As of December 31, 2020, Crackle Plus served more than 30 million monthly active visitors through many distribution platforms including Roku, Amazon Fire, Vizio and others. These visitors viewed content produced through our various television production affiliates, acquired by Screen Media, or licensed from Sony Pictures Television (SPT), Lionsgate, Paramount, Fox, Warner Brothers and more than 100 other production and distribution companies. For the period ended December 31, 2020, viewers of Crackle Plus networks have access to more than 10,800 films and 22,000 episodes of licensed or company-owned original or exclusive programming. The Company’s original and exclusive programming made up approximately 18.4% of total ad impressions served in 2020. 
​
Screen Media manages one of the industry’s largest independently owned television and film libraries consisting of approximately 1,350 feature films and 275 episodes of television programming. Screen Media also acquires between 10 and 20 new films each year. Screen Media provides content for the Crackle Plus portfolio and also distributes its library to other exhibitors and third-party networks to generate additional revenue and operating cash flow. 
​
Chicken Soup for the Soul’s various television production activities are done through a number of affiliates including Landmark Studio Group, Chicken Soup for the Soul Originals, and APlus.com, which produce or co-produce original content for Crackle Plus and, occasionally, for other third-party networks. 
​
We believe that we are the only independent ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) business with the proven capability to acquire, create and distribute original programming and that we have access one of the largest libraries of valuable

company-owned and third-party content. We believe this differentiation is important at a time of a major shift in consumer viewing habits as the growth in both availability and quality of high-speed broadband enables consumers to consume video content at any time on any device.
​
Since our inception in January 2015, our business has grown rapidly. For the full year 2020, our net revenue was $66.4 million, as compared to the full year 2019 net revenue of $55.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the strong performance of our distribution operation area and the full year inclusion of the Crackle Plus network to our business (acquired May 2019). We had net losses of approximately $44.6 million in 2020, as compared to net losses of $35.0 million in 2019. Our 2020 Adjusted EBITDA was approximately, $11.8 million, as compared to 2019 Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 million. As described below in “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure”, we use Adjusted EBITDA as an important metric for management. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition” and “Item 8. Financial Statements” for more information.
​
According to industry projections, the U.S. market for AVOD network revenue is expected to increase from $26.6 billion in 2020 to $53.5 billion in 2025. At the same time, advertising spending on linear television networks is expected to decline as more viewers transition from pay television subscriptions to online video viewing. For these reasons, interest in the AVOD business model is increasing, evidenced by traditional linear network operators increasingly seeking to acquire or launch AVOD networks to maintain access to viewers making this transition. We believe AVOD networks will continue to grow rapidly, particularly as consumers seek affordable programming alternatives to multiple SVOD offerings.
​
Our Strategy
In this environment we believe we are in a differentiated position. We identified the trends favoring growth of AVOD networks in 2015 and began building our offering in 2017, including the development of our original content production strategy. Our strategic objective is to build the premier ad-supported streaming network for both viewers and advertisers. In pursuing this goal, we believe we have the advantage of being unencumbered by the competing strategic choices and priorities of diversified media companies that own VOD networks and legacy linear television networks. We are singularly focused on building leading VOD networks that feature a range of mass-appeal and thematic programming options with a focus on original and exclusive content, and that employ innovation and data analytics to deliver more personalized viewing experiences and more engaging advertising. We are executing on this strategy in three ways:

● | Content: Cost-effectively grow our production business, our content library asset and our ownership of content rights. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Original & Exclusive programming. Our “originals and exclusives” focus, supported by our distribution and production business, is designed to distinguish our network brands among viewers. We are able to add to our existing broad base of content without the significant capital outlay of a traditional television or film studio by producing new originals at low cost through creative partnerships, such as our award-winning 2019 series Going from Broke, which will begin production of its second season in 2021. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Expanding production capacity. We believe we can continue to build an attractive and cost-effective content development pipeline by expanding our production capacity through partnerships such as our majority owned subsidiary Landmark Studio Group, and by partnering with proven industry talent who prefer to work, at times, outside of the consolidated major studio industry, where, we believe it is increasingly difficult for this talent to control the creative process and ownership rights to their intellectual property. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Content acquisition and rights ownership. Through Screen Media, we will continue to acquire the rights to additional exclusive content. This strategy will reduce our reliance on content licensing, which will lead to lower costs of revenue and increased gross margin and provide us with wider distribution opportunities to generate additional revenue. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Advertising: Utilize existing technology and data to deliver innovative advertising formats and relevant ads that engage viewers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Attractive audience. We believe we enjoy strong relationships with leading advertisers based on our demographic reach, our sales approach and our commitment to premium content and innovative, engaging ad formats. Our networks offer advertisers a desirable target audience: the average age of Crackle viewers is 33, compared to 58 for traditional broadcast networks, and 54 for advertising-supported cable networks. We estimate that 32% of our viewers fall in the 18-34 age demographic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ​

o | Diverse sales channels. To reach these viewers we employ a diverse and targeted advertising sales strategy, using multiple sales channels to provide us with optionality. Nearly 90% of our advertising revenues are derived from direct sales and local reseller agreements, which we believe give us greater margin contribution and control over our advertising avails than is possible with programmatic advertising.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Technology investment. As we grow our portfolio of networks, we are investing in the integration of advertising platform technology stacks and the growth of our sales force. We are also testing new advertising formats and technologies that drive user engagement and offer increased value to advertisers. For example, our “Jumbotron” format engages viewers immediately upon their entry to the Crackle app through video and sound, with premium ad placement in our “Spotlight Channel”. Our “FreeView” format offers viewers who select a title the option to watch one 30 to 60 second advertisement before starting the program, in exchange for an extended advertisement-free experience. “FreeView” has been demonstrated to drive higher user engagement with the placed advertisement and higher brand recall. As we execute on all of these initiatives, we believe we will be positioned to increase both overall advertising sales and ad insertion rates, firmly establishing our AVOD networks as a compelling option for advertisers compared to traditional linear broadcast or cable networks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Viewership: Grow distribution to gain new viewers and employ sophisticated data analytics to deliver more compelling experiences. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Content and Distribution. We exploit our increasing, exclusive access to quality programming to grow and retain viewers on our existing networks. To augment audience acquisition we have engaged in distribution arrangements with an increasing number of media platforms including Roku, Amazon Fire, Vizio, Samsung , LG and others. In the Spring of 2021, for example, our new distribution partnership with Vizio will feature a “Crackle button” on a large number of new Vizio television remote controls to increase Crackle awareness and guide viewers to our leading AVOD network.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | New Genre-specific Networks. As we grow our content libraries, we are also continuously evaluating opportunities to create new thematic networks that focus on certain genres and types of programming and we expect these networks to deliver more targeted advertising opportunities to marketers. We are also actively evaluating opportunities to acquire additional AVOD networks that can accelerate our path to even greater scale.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

o | Personalized Viewer Experiences. As we grow viewership and as our networks progress, we are gathering a growing amount of data on what our viewers watch and also how they engage with advertising. We are increasingly investing in capabilities to manage and analyze our data with the goal of better personalizing viewer experiences and enabling targeted advertising. Over time, by combining this effort with continued innovation in user interfaces, we may consolidate our general entertainment and themed AVOD offerings into a single AVOD network with multiple channels, in a format similar to current subscription VOD networks

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | In 2020, we began to create linear free advertising supported streaming television (“FAST”) networks for certain of the platforms we have AVOD networks on including Plex, Vizio , Samsung, Xumo and others. We see these networks as a way to increase the ad impressions we generate with our content library as well as a way to efficiently market the breadth of the content that is available on our AVOD networks. We expect to create more of these FAST networks in 2021.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | We also sell advertising for other networks in order to aggregate a greater number of ad impressions for our advertising customers. In 2020, these networks included Funimation and CrunchyRoll. We recently entered into an agreement with Plex to sell ads on their behalf as well.

​
Distribution and Production. In this operations area, we produce television content through various affiliates and acquire and distribute movies and television series worldwide through Screen Media. The primary purpose of Screen Media and our television production affiliates is to provide our Crackle Plus VOD networks with original and exclusive programming. In addition, Screen Media’s ability to distribute acquired or company-produced films and television series enables us to further monetize programming on a cost advantaged basis. Through our Screen Media subsidiary, we maintain license agreements to distribute our content across all media, including theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, free, cable, pay television, VOD, mobile and new digital media platforms worldwide. We own the copyright or long-term distribution rights to approximately 1350 feature films and 275 television episodes, representing one of the largest independently owned libraries of filmed entertainment in the world.
​
Through Screen Media, our cable and satellite VOD distribution agreements include those with DirecTV, Cablevision (Altice USA), Verizon and In Demand (owned by Comcast, Charter and Time Warner Cable). Our Internet VOD distribution agreements include those with Amazon, iTunes, Samsung, YouTube, Hulu, Xbox, Netflix, Sony, and Vudu, among others. We have also expanded our international distribution capabilities which were expanded in 2020.
​
We produce content utilizing the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand, together with our management’s industry experience and expertise, to generate revenue through the production and distribution of video content with sponsors. Since we seek

to have both the committed funding and contractually agreed upon production costs for our video content prior to moving forward with a project, we have high visibility into the profitability of a particular project before committing to proceed with such project. In addition, we take limited financial risk on developing our projects.
​
We operate a low-cost content production strategy by partnering with brand sponsors, utilizing tax credits and pre-selling rights to various media companies in order to mitigate our financial risk on project development. Doing so allows us to secure committed funding and production capabilities for our original video content prior to moving forward with a project. This provides us with high visibility into the profitability of a particular project before committing to proceed with such projects. Completed projects provide Crackle Plus with original content while providing the company with additional distribution revenue opportunities. Part of this strategy, Landmark Studios, which develops, produces, distributes and owns the IP it creates, building a valuable library. The studio is independent, having the ability to sell its content to any network or platform, while also developing and producing original content for Crackle Plus. Landmark controls all worldwide rights and distributes those rights exclusively through Screen Media.
​
Competition
​
We are in a highly competitive business. The market for streaming entertainment is rapidly changing. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and computer-related activities. We compete for viewers and programming with much larger companies which have significant resources and brand recognition, including dominant video on demand providers such as Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Fox, and major film and television studios. We also compete with numerous independent motion picture and television distribution and production companies, television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for viewers, subscribers, and the services of performing artists, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses.
 ​
In addition, our video content competes for media outlet and audience acceptance with video content produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our video content is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing video content available in the marketplace at or near the same time.
 ​
Given such competition, and our stage of development, we emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. We rely on our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative, desirable video content.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We are party to the “CSS License Agreement,”(as defined) through which we have been granted the perpetual, exclusive, worldwide license by CSS to exclusively exhibit, produce and distribute video content using the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand and related content, such as stories published in the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Chicken Soup for the Soul and related names are trademarks owned by CSS. We have the proprietary rights (including copyrights) in all company-produced content and believe the Brand provides a competitive advantage in attracting advertisers and entertainment talent. As a result of the acquisitions of Screen Media, Pivotshare, Crackle and other smaller libraries and companies we now own copyrights or global long-term distribution rights and AVOD rights to approximately 10,800 films and 22,000 television episodes.
 ​
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, which are described more fully in the section titled “Risk Factors”.
