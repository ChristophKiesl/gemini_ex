Changes from Prior Periodic Reports
In this report we have complied with the disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Release No. 33-10825 “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105” and we have early adopted the changes in disclosure standards included in SEC Release No. 33-10890 “Management's Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information.”
Modernization of Regulation S-K
Effective as of November 9, 2020, the SEC issued Release No. 33-10825 “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105”. This release was adopted to modernize the description of business, legal proceedings, and risk factor disclosures that registrants are required to make pursuant to Regulation S-K. Specifically, this release requires registrants to provide disclosure relating to their human capital resources and to restructure their risk factor disclosures. Additionally, the release increases the threshold for disclosure of environmental proceedings to which the government is a party. This report reflects these changes. These changes are required for any annual report subsequent to the effective date. As such, we have adopted these changes in this report. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information
In November 2020, the SEC issued Release No. 33-10890, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information”, which will become fully effective on August 9, 2021, with voluntary compliance permitted on or after February 10, 2021. This release was adopted to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the SEC eliminated the requirement for selected financial data, only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting comprehensive income, and amending the matters required to be presented under Management’s Discussion and Analysis to, among other things, eliminate the requirement of the contractual obligations table. Early application is permitted if companies comply with the amended item in its entirety. We elected to adopt changes early in this Form 10-K.
General Description of Business and Operations
Sila Realty Trust, Inc., formerly known as Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc., or the Company, or we, is a Maryland corporation that was formed on January 11, 2013, and has elected, and currently qualifies, to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Sila Realty Operating Partnership, LP f/k/a Carter Validus Operating Partnership II, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or the Operating Partnership, formed on January 10, 2013. We are the sole general partner and, prior to the completion of the Internalization Transaction (as defined herein) on September 30, 2020, Carter Validus Advisors II, LLC, or our Former Advisor, was the special limited partner of the Operating Partnership. As of the closing of the Internalization Transaction, we own directly, all of the interests in the Operating Partnership.
We were formed to invest primarily in quality income-producing commercial real estate, with a focus on data centers and healthcare properties, preferably with long-term leases, to creditworthy tenants, as well as to make other real estate-related investments in such property types, which may include equity or debt interests, including securities, in other real estate entities. We also may originate or invest in real estate-related debt.
We raised the equity capital for our real estate investments through two public offerings, or the Offerings, from May 2014 through November 2018, and we have offered shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, pursuant to two Registration Statements on Form S-3 (each, a “DRIP Offering” and together the "DRIP Offerings") since November 2017. As of December 31, 2020, we had accepted investors’ subscriptions for and issued approximately 151,238,000 shares of Class A, Class I, Class T and Class T2 common stock in our Offerings, resulting in receipt of gross proceeds of approximately $1,467,668,000, before share repurchases of $116,956,000, selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $96,734,000 and other offering costs of approximately $27,618,000
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 153 real estate properties, comprising of approximately 8,480,000 rentable square feet of single-tenant and multi-tenant commercial space located in 68 metropolitan statistical areas, or MSA, and two micropolitan statistical areas, or µSA. As of December 31, 2020, the rentable space of these real estate properties was 93.0% leased.
Table of Contents

We have historically established, and intend to continue to establish, an estimated per share net asset value, or Estimated Per Share NAV, on at least an annual basis. Each Estimated Per Share NAV was determined by our board of directors after consultation with an independent third-party valuation firm. The Estimated Per Share NAV is not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm. The following table outlines the established Estimated Per Share NAV as determined by our board of directors for the last three years as of each valuation date presented below:
Valuation Date | Effective Date | Estimated Per Share NAV
June 30, 2018 | October 1, 2018 | $9.25 
October 31, 2019 | December 18, 2019 | $8.65 
September 30, 2020 | December 8, 2020 | $8.69 

The global outbreak of coronavirus, or COVID-19, has forced temporary closures, changes to the operating hours or other temporary changes to the business of certain tenants in our healthcare and data center properties. In response, certain of our tenants had sought rent concessions, including decreased rent or rent deferrals. We discussed the circumstances with our tenants and granted rent deferrals to an immaterial number of tenants impacted by COVID-19, relative to the overall portfolio. At this time, we anticipate decreased rent and rent deferral repayments to continue for a relatively short time and to have an immaterial impact on the collectability of tenant receivables over their respective term of the lease. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we entered into 30 rent concessions and lease modifications due to the impact of COVID-19 on our tenants, and collected approximately 99% of rental revenue related to these lease concessions and lease modifications for such period. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the future value of our assets may be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Therefore, although we intend to publish an updated Estimated Per Share NAV on an annual basis, we may be required to reevaluate the Estimated Per Share NAV sooner if the COVID-19 outbreak has an impact on our Company, tenants and assets that materially differs from the impact currently factored into our Estimated Per Share NAV.
SC Distributors, LLC, an affiliate of our Former Advisor, or our Dealer Manager, served as the dealer manager of our Offerings. Effective September 30, 2020, as a result of the Internalization Transaction, the Dealer Manager is no longer affiliated with us. The Dealer Manager received fees for services related to our Offerings. We continue to pay the Dealer Manager a distribution and servicing fee with respect to Class T and Class T2 shares that were sold in our Offerings.
Our shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of the stockholders. In the event we do not achieve a liquidity event on or before the seventh anniversary of the completion or termination of the primary offering of our initial public offering, or November 24, 2024, our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend or eliminate the deadline to achieve a liquidity event (which would require the approval of our stockholders); or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio. A liquidity event could include a sale of all or substantially all our assets, a sale or merger of our company, a listing of our common stock on a national securities exchange (provided we meet the then applicable listing requirements), or other similar transaction.
Except as the context otherwise requires, “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to Sila Realty Trust, Inc., our Operating Partnership and all wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Internalization Transaction
Prior to September 30, 2020, we were externally advised and managed by Carter Validus Advisors II, LLC, or our Former Advisor. On July 28, 2020, we and our Operating Partnership entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, which provided for the internalization of the external management functions previously performed for us and our Operating Partnership by our Former Advisor and its affiliates, or the Internalization Transaction. The Purchase Agreement was entered into with our Former Advisor and various affiliates of our Former Advisor, or the Sellers, and Sila Realty Management Company, LLC f/k/a CV Manager, LLC, a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, or Manager Sub. On September 30, 2020, we closed the Internalization Transaction. Effective September 30, 2020, as a result of the Internalization Transaction, our Former Advisor is no longer affiliated with us.
Under the Purchase Agreement and related agreements, immediately prior to the closing of the Internalization Transaction, the Sellers assigned or caused to be assigned to Manager Sub all of the assets necessary to operate our business and our subsidiaries, or the Business, and delegated all obligations of the Sellers in connection with the Business to Manager Sub pursuant to an assignment and acceptance agreement. Immediately thereafter, under the Purchase Agreement, our Operating Partnership (i) acquired 100% of the membership interests in Manager Sub for an aggregate cash purchase price of $40,000,000, subject to certain adjustments, or the Purchase Price, and (ii) redeemed our Former Advisor’s limited partner

interest (including special limited partner interest) in our Operating Partnership. $25,000,000 of the Purchase Price was paid on September 30, 2020, or the Closing, and, subject to certain acceleration provisions: (i) $7,500,000 will be due and payable on March 31, 2021, and (ii) $7,500,000 will be due and payable on March 31, 2022.
On September 30, 2020, we and Sila REIT, LLC, f/k/a Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, LLC, entered into the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of our Operating Partnership, or the Third A&R LP Agreement, in order to reflect the completion of the Internalization Transaction.
Upon completion of the Internalization Transaction, 76 individuals, who were previously employed by an affiliate of our Former Advisor, became our employees, and the functions previously performed by our Former Advisor were internalized by us. As an internally managed company, we will no longer pay our Former Advisor and its affiliates any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the advisory agreement that was terminated prior to the Closing.
Concurrently with, and as a condition to the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, we entered into an employment agreement with each of Michael A. Seton and Kay C. Neely, pursuant to which Mr. Seton and Ms. Neely have served from and after the Closing as our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. Such employment agreements became effective at and upon the Closing.
Effective upon the Closing, our board of directors approved the establishment of a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee.
On July 28, 2020, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, John E. Carter resigned as the chairman of our board of directors, effective immediately. On July 28, 2020, our board of directors elected Jonathan Kuchin, independent director and the chairman of the audit committee, as chairman of our board of directors, effective immediately. On September 30, 2020, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and as a closing condition therein, John E. Carter resigned as a director of our board of directors at and upon the Closing. As a result of Mr. Carter’s resignation, our board of directors reduced its size so that it now has five members, four of whom are independent directors.
Other Key Developments during 2020 and Subsequent
•On April 30, 2020, due to the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any impact it may have on us, our board of directors decided to temporarily suspend share repurchases under the share repurchase program, except for repurchase requests due to death, effective with repurchase requests processed on the third quarter repurchase date of 2020, which was July 30, 2020. On December 11, 2020, our board of directors authorized and approved the Amended and Restated Share Repurchase Program, or the A&R SRP, which applied beginning with the first quarter repurchase date of 2021, which was January 28, 2021. Under the A&R SRP, the Company will only repurchase shares due to death or involuntary exigent circumstance in accordance with the A&R SRP, subject in each case to the terms and limitations of the A&R SRP, including, but not limited to, quarterly share limitations, an annual 5.0% share limitation and DRIP funding limitations.
•On December 1, 2020, our board of directors established the Estimated Per Share NAV of $8.69, which was calculated as of September 30, 2020, and became effective on December 8, 2020.
•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased two operating healthcare properties, comprising approximately 49,000 of rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16,077,000. In addition, we purchased one development healthcare property for approximately $58,000 in acquisition costs and funded approximately $849,000 related to the construction. We anticipate completing the development project in January 2022.
•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold two healthcare properties for an aggregate sale price of $58,000,000 and generated net proceeds of $28,542,000. In connection with the sale of one of the healthcare properties, we issued a note receivable in the amount of $28,000,000. 
•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we drew $140,000,000 on our credit facility, $20,000,000 of which was related to a property acquisition and the funding of share repurchases, $75,000,000 was drawn to provide additional liquidity due to the uncertainty in overall economic conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic and $45,000,000 was related to another property acquisition and the Internalization Transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repaid $110,000,000 on our credit facility.
•As of March 19, 2021, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, owned 153 real estate properties, for an aggregate purchase price of $3,084,201,000 and composed of approximately 8,541,000 rentable square feet of commercial space.
•As of March 19, 2021, we had a $938,000,000 outstanding principal balance under our credit facility.

Investment Objectives and Policies
Our primary investment objectives are to:
•acquire high quality healthcare properties and data centers leased to tenants capitalizing on critical and structural economic growth drivers; 
•pay regular cash distributions to stockholders;
•preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders;
•realize appreciated growth in the value of our investments upon the sale of such investments in whole or in part; and
•be prudent, patient and deliberate with respect to the purchase and sale of our investments considering current and future real estate markets.
We cannot assure stockholders that we will attain these objectives or that the value of our assets will not decrease. Furthermore, within our investment objectives and policies, we have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments and the purchase and sale of our assets, subject to the approval of our board of directors. Our board of directors may revise our investment objectives and policies if it determines it is in the best interest of our stockholders.
Investment Strategy
We focus our investment activities on acquiring mission critical net-leased properties that are primarily in the data center and healthcare sectors. We expect that most of our properties will continue to be located throughout the continental United States; however, we may purchase properties in other jurisdictions. We may also invest in real estate-related debt and securities that meet our investment strategy and return criteria, provided that we do not intend for such investments to constitute a significant portion of our assets, and we will evaluate our assets to ensure that any such investments do not cause us to fail to maintain our REIT status or cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
We seek to obtain investments that are (i) essential to the successful business operations of the tenant, or "mission critical"; (ii) leased to creditworthy and investment grade tenants, preferably on a net-leased basis; (iii) long-term leases, preferably with terms of six years or longer, which typically include annual or periodic fixed rental increases; and (iv) located in geographically diverse, established markets with superior access and visibility.
We may acquire properties in various stages of development or that require substantial refurbishment or renovation. We will make this determination based upon a variety of factors, including the available risk-adjusted returns for such properties when compared with other available properties, the effect such properties would have on the diversification of our portfolio, and our investment objectives of realizing both current income and capital appreciation upon the sale of such properties.
To the extent feasible, we will continue to seek to achieve a well-balanced portfolio of real estate investments that is diversified by geographic location, age and lease maturities. We also intend to focus on acquiring properties in the high-growth data center and healthcare sectors. We expect that tenants of our properties will be diversified between national, regional and local companies.
Creditworthy Tenants
We expect many of the tenants of our properties to be creditworthy national or regional companies with high net worth and high operating income.
A tenant is considered creditworthy if it has a financial profile that we believe meets our criteria. In evaluating the creditworthiness of a tenant or prospective tenant, we will not use specific quantifiable standards, but will consider many factors, including, but not limited to, the proposed terms of the property acquisition, the financial condition of the tenant and/or guarantor, the operating history of the property with the tenant, the tenant’s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant’s industry segment, and the lease length and other lease terms at the time of the property acquisition.
We monitor the credit of our tenants to stay abreast of any material changes in credit quality. We monitor tenant credit by: (1) reviewing the credit ratings of tenants (or their parent companies) that are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies; (2) reviewing financial statements that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease; (3) monitoring news reports and other available information regarding our tenants and their underlying businesses; (4) monitoring the timeliness of rent collections; and (5) conducting periodic inspections of our properties to ascertain proper maintenance, repair and upkeep. During the year ended December 31, 2020, and subsequent, through the day of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain of our tenants experienced a deterioration in their creditworthiness due to a number of factors, 
Table of Contents

including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, however, none of these tenants are material to our overall portfolio.
Description of Leases
We generally acquire properties subject to existing tenant leases. When spaces in properties become vacant, existing leases expire, or we acquire properties under development or requiring substantial refurbishment or renovation, we anticipate entering into net leases. Net leases typically require tenants to pay, in addition to a fixed rent, all or a majority of the costs relating to the three broad expense categories of real estate taxes (including special assessments and sales and use taxes), insurance and common area maintenance (including repair and maintenance, utilities, cleaning and other operating expenses related to the property), excluding the roof and structure of the property. Generally, the leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. As a precautionary measure, we may obtain, to the extent available, secondary liability insurance, as well as loss-of-rents insurance. Tenants are generally required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing a certificate of insurance to us on an annual basis. With respect to multi-tenant properties, we expect to have a variety of lease arrangements with the tenants of these properties. Since each lease is an individually negotiated contract between two or more parties, each lease will have different obligations of both the landlord and tenant. Many large national tenants have standard lease forms that generally do not vary from property to property. We will have limited ability to revise the terms of leases to those tenants. We expect that multi-tenant properties may be subject to "gross" or "modified gross" leases. "Gross" leases require the tenant to pay a fixed rental amount inclusive of all of the tenant's operating expenses. Any operating expenses not covered by the tenant's rental amount are the responsibility of the landlord (including any operating expense increases in subsequent years). "Modified gross" leases typically require the tenant to pay, in addition to a fixed rental amount, a portion of the operating expenses of the property.
A majority of our acquisitions generally have lease terms of six years or longer at the time of the property acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term of our properties was 9.6 years. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Some of the leases also will contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent periodically during the lease term.
Investment Decisions
We may purchase, without the specific prior approval of our board of directors, properties with a purchase price of less than $15,000,000, so long as the investment in the property would not, if consummated, violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness and the consideration to be paid for such properties does not exceed the fair market value of such properties. Where the purchase price is equal to or greater than $15,000,000, investment decisions will be made by our board of directors upon our recommendation.
In evaluating and presenting investments for approval, we, to the extent such information is available, consider and provide to our board of directors, with respect to each property, the following:
•proposed purchase price, terms and conditions;
•physical condition, age, curb appeal and environmental reports;
•location, visibility and access;
•historical financial performance;
•tenant rent roll and tenant creditworthiness;
•lease terms, including rent, rent increases, length of lease term, specific tenant and landlord responsibilities, renewal, expansion, termination, purchase options, exclusive and permitted uses provisions, assignment and sublease provisions, and co-tenancy requirements;
•local market economic conditions, demographics and population growth patterns;
•neighboring properties; and
•potential for new property construction in the area.
Investing in and Originating Loans
Our criteria for originating or acquiring loans are substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties. We may invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. Further, we may invest in unsecured loans or loans secured by assets other than real estate; however, we will not make unsecured loans or loans not secured by mortgages unless such loans are approved by a majority of our independent directors.
Table of Contents

Our underwriting process typically involves comprehensive financial, structural, operational and legal due diligence. We do not require an appraisal of the underlying property from a certified independent appraiser for an investment in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans.
We will not make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans outstanding on the property, including our borrowings, would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, unless substantial justification exists, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors. Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans in cases in which it believes there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property or we intend to foreclose upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets.
We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or we may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders. We will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the term of the loan, the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meet our investment criteria and objectives.
Investing in Real Estate Securities
We may invest in non-majority owned securities of both publicly-traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. We may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire such securities. However, any investment in equity securities (including any preferred equity securities) that are not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an over-the-counter market must be approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable.
Acquisition Structure
We have and expect to continue to acquire fee interests in properties (a fee interest is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although other methods of acquiring a property may be utilized if we deem them to be advantageous.
To achieve our investment objectives, and to further diversify our portfolio, we have invested and will continue to invest in properties using a number of acquisition structures, which could include direct and indirect acquisitions, joint ventures, leveraged investments, issuing units in our Operating Partnership in exchange for properties and making mortgages or other loans secured by the same types of properties which we may acquire.
Joint Ventures
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership partnerships for the purpose of making investments. Some of the potential reasons to enter into a joint venture would be to acquire assets we could not otherwise acquire, to reduce our capital commitment to a particular asset, or to benefit from certain expertise a partner might have. In determining whether to invest in a particular joint venture, we evaluate the assets of the joint venture under the same criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the selection of our investments. We also evaluate the terms of the joint venture as well as the financial condition, operating capabilities and integrity of our partner or partners.
Disposition Policy
We intend to hold each asset we acquire for an extended period of time, generally five to seven years, or for the life of the Company. However, circumstances may arise that could result in the earlier sale of some assets. The determination of whether an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, specific real estate market conditions, tax implications for our stockholders, and other factors. The requirements for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes also will put some limits on our ability to sell assets after short holding periods.
We may, with the prior approval of our board of directors, dispose of an asset or asset portfolios with a contract sale price of $15,000,000 or less, using the greater of (i) the most recent net asset value for such asset or asset portfolio, as determined by an independent third-party expert and (ii) the contract sale price of such asset or asset portfolio. Where the sale price is greater than $15,000,000, decisions will be made by our board of directors upon management's recommendation.
The sale price of a property that is net-leased will be determined in large part by the amount of rent payable under the lease and the capitalization rate applied to that rent. If a tenant has a repurchase option at a formula price, we may be limited in realizing any appreciation. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. The terms of payment will be affected by custom in the area in which the property being sold is located and the then-prevailing economic conditions.
Table of Contents

Qualification as a REIT
We elected, and currently qualify, to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we would then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
Financing Strategy and Policies
We believe that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objectives and has the potential to maximize returns to our stockholders. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at a later time. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. We intend to limit our aggregate borrowings to 50% of the fair market value of our assets, unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors.
Distribution Policy
The amount of distributions we pay to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and restrictions imposed by our organizational documents and Maryland law.
We currently pay, and intend to continue to pay, monthly distributions to our stockholders. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund distributions, we may borrow or sell assets in order to fund distributions, or make distributions out of net proceeds from potential future offerings. We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations. Subject to certain exceptions, there is no limit to the amount of distributions that we may pay out of net proceeds from potential future offerings.
In accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
To the extent that distributions to our stockholders are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions are taxable as ordinary income. To the extent that our distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital to our stockholders for federal income tax purposes, to the extent of their basis in their stock, and thereafter will constitute a capital gain. 
See Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Distributions," for further discussion on distribution rates approved by our board of directors.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 74 employees, of which approximately 65% were female and 35% were male. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, minorities represented approximately 31% of our workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct annual training designed to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual 
Table of Contents

orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law and are routinely recognized for outstanding performance. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. Our employees are offered great flexibility to meet personal and family needs. In an effort to ensure employee safety, we moved to a remote work environment at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to be a primarily remote workforce. Once we determine it is safe to resume in-office operations, we will maintain a flexible work policy that allows for remote work at varying levels, dependent on an employee's role in the Company.
Reportable Segments
We operate through two reportable business segments – commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare. See Note 14—"Segment Reporting" to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Insurance
See the section captioned “—Description of Leases” above.
Competition
As we continue to purchase properties for our portfolio, we are in competition with other potential buyers (some of whom have more cash, available liquidity, and/or offer competitive advantages against us in the acquisition of properties) for the same properties and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers, or we may have to locate another property that meets our investment criteria. Although we generally acquire properties subject to existing leases, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Leases
As of December 31, 2020, we had cash on deposit, including restricted cash and escrowed funds, in certain financial institutions that had deposits in excess of current federally insured levels. We limit cash investments to financial institutions with high credit standing; therefore, we believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on our cash deposits. To date, we have not experienced any loss of or lack of access to cash in our accounts.
The following table shows the segment diversification of our real estate properties based on rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020:
