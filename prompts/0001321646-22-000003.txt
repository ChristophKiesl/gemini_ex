THE COMPANY
General
We are a leading global sustainable specialty chemicals company that manufactures styrenic block copolymers (“SBCs”), specialty polymers, and high-value bio-based products primarily derived from pine wood pulping co-products. Our operations are managed through two operating segments: (i) Polymer segment and (ii) Chemical segment. See Note 13 Industry Segment and Foreign Operations to the consolidated financial statements for segment reporting of financial results.
References in this report to “Kraton,” “our company,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” and “us” as used in this report refer collectively to Kraton Corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Except as expressly stated otherwise in this Form 10-K, disclosures herein relate to Kraton as a standalone corporation and do not take into account the status or closing of the Merger and any effect on the Company thereafter. Following the closing of the Merger, Kraton will be a privately held company and no longer subject to the disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
This Form 10-K includes financial statements and related notes that present the consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of Kraton Corporation. Kraton Corporation is a holding company whose only material asset is its investment in its wholly owned subsidiary, Kraton Polymers LLC. Kraton Polymers LLC and its subsidiaries own all of our consolidated operating assets.
Corporate History
Kraton Corporation was incorporated in 2009 under Delaware law and is the successor to a Delaware limited liability company formed in 2003. In December 2009, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). On January 6, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Arizona Chemical (the “Arizona Chemical Acquisition”). We conduct our business through Kraton Polymers LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries.
On March 6, 2020, we completed the sale of our Cariflex business to Daelim Industrial Co, Ltd. (subsequently renamed “DL Holdings Co., Ltd.”). As part of the sale, we entered into a multi-year Isoprene Rubber Supply Agreement (“IRSA”) with DL Chemical. In accordance with the IRSA, we will supply Isoprene Rubber (“IR”) to DL Chemical for a period of five years, with an optional extension for an additional five years. See Note 4 Disposition and Exit of Business Activities for further discussion of the IRSA. On September 27, 2021, we entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which DL Chemical, a subsidiary of DL Holdings Co., Ltd. (formerly Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd.), agreed to acquire 100.0% of us in an all-cash transaction.
Agreement and Plan of Merger. On September 27, 2021, Kraton Corporation (the “Company” for purposes of this section) entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock of the Company then outstanding will be converted into the right to receive $46.50 in cash, without interest, other than (1) those shares owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent or the Company (which will be cancelled without any consideration) and (2) any shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised, and not withdrawn, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.
On December 9, 2021, the Company held a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company, at which stockholders of Kraton overwhelmingly approved and adopted the Merger Agreement. The acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2022.
POLYMER SEGMENT PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
SBCs are highly-engineered synthetic elastomers, which we invented and commercialized over 50 years ago. We developed the first unhydrogenated styrenic block copolymers (“USBC”) in 1964 and the first hydrogenated styrenic block copolymers (“HSBC”) in the late 1960s. Our SBCs enhance the performance of numerous products by imparting greater flexibility, resilience, strength, durability, and processability, and are used in a wide range of applications, including adhesives, coatings, consumer and personal care products, sealants, lubricants, medical, packaging, automotive, paving and roofing, and footwear products. Prior to the sale of our Cariflex business, under the Cariflex brand name, we also sold IR and isoprene rubber latex (“IRL”), which are non-SBC products primarily used in applications such as medical products, personal care, adhesives, tackifiers, paints, and coatings. As part of the sale, we continue to produce and sell IR in accordance with the IRSA with DL Chemical.
We believe our SBC products offer many characteristics that help our customers drive towards their sustainability goals. Among others, our SBCs may offer features such as greater recyclability, increased durability that reduces the costly need for maintenance and replacement, and alternatives to less environmentally friendly materials, such as PVCs.
Our SBCs are high performance elastomers that are engineered for a wide range of applications. Our SBC products possess a combination of high strength and low viscosity, which facilitates ease of processing at elevated temperatures and high processing speeds. Our products can be processed in a variety of manufacturing applications, including injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, extrusion and hot melt, and solution applied coatings.
The majority of worldwide SBC production is dedicated to USBCs, which are primarily used in paving, roofing, adhesives, sealants, coatings, and footwear applications. HSBCs, which are significantly more complex and capital-intensive to manufacture than USBCs, are used in applications such as lubricant additives, soft touch and flexible materials, personal hygiene products, medical products, automotive components, certain adhesive and sealant applications, and protective films. 
Our Polymer segment products are manufactured and our commercial activities are organized in the following product groups based upon polymer chemistry and process technologies: Performance Products, Specialty Polymers, IR sold exclusively to DL Chemical in accordance with the IRSA, and Cariflex (prior to March 6, 2020).
Performance Products
Our Performance Products are comprised of USBC product grades, which impart characteristics such as:
•resistance to temperature and weather extremes in roads and roofing;
•resistance to cracking, reduced road noise, and better water dispersion; and
•increased processing flexibility in adhesive formulations for packaging tapes and labels, and materials used in disposable diapers.
In paving and roofing applications, our Performance Products primarily consist of styrene-butadiene-styrene (“SBS”) for use in modified asphalt applications, which in roofing applications produces stronger and more durable felts and shingles, and in paving applications enhances the strength and elasticity of asphalt-based paving compositions over an extended temperature range. In paving applications, we believe our polymers extend road life by allowing pavements to withstand heavy traffic loads and varying climate conditions, and our HiMA technology can reduce required inputs while extending road life in new road construction. Our roofing applications provide a more sustainable alternative by increasing durability and system life. Our sustainable paving applications allow thinner full-depth pavements and longer road life, reducing raw materials required for paving and lessening pollution caused by congestion arising from frequent repairs of roads. Our products primarily compete with chemicals such as styrene-butadiene rubber latex, acetates, polyphosphoric acids and thermoplastic materials like ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer, polyethylene, atactic polypropylene and unmodified asphalts. We believe that customer choice for these markets is driven principally by total end-product cost, temperature performance, bitumen source and application. 
In personal care applications, our Performance Products primarily consist of SBS and styrene-isoprene-styrene (“SIS”) for the manufacturing of ultra-thin stretchable films used for the production of diapers. In addition, our SIS polymers are also used in the lamination process for other personal care products. Our products primarily compete against low priced alternatives such as metallocenes. We believe that customer choice for these markets is driven principally by total end-product cost and performance.
In adhesives applications, our Performance Products primarily compete with ethylene-vinyl acetate, polyolefins, and metallocene polyolefins. The choice between these materials is influenced by bond strength, specific adhesion, consistent performance to specification, processing speed, hot-melt application, resistance to water and cost. Our SBCs are compatible with many other formulating ingredients. We believe demand for utilization of SBC-based adhesives is primarily driven by cost reduction and higher performance.
Specialty Polymers. Our Specialty Polymers are comprised of HSBC products that are significantly more complex to produce than our Performance Products. As a result, our Specialty Polymers generally generate higher margins than our Performance Products. 
Our Specialty Polymers impart characteristics such as:
•improved flow characteristics for many industrial and consumer sealant and lubricating fluids;
•soft feel in numerous consumer products such as razor handles, power tools, and automobile components;
•impact resistance for demanding engineered plastic applications;
•flexibility for wire and cable plastic outer layers;
•stretch properties in disposable diapers and adult incontinence products;
•resistance to ultraviolet light;
•processing stability and viscosity; and
•elevated temperature resistance.
We believe our HSBC offerings are often the more sustainable choice when compared to alternatives. Among other features, our HSBCs can offer improved recyclability of polyethylene-terephthalate and polypropylene streams, and function as replacements for less sustainable alternatives such as PVC, mainly in medical applications.
Our products primarily compete against a variety of chemical and non-chemical alternatives including, but not limited to, thermoplastic vulcanizate, thermoplastic polyurethane, PVC, thermoplastic polyolefin, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyamide, and ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer based products. We believe demand for our Specialty Polymers portfolio is principally driven by customer-specific needs and the ability to balance performance characteristics such as soft-touch, durability, stretch and impact.
Because many of our products are highly engineered and customized formulations, they require specialized product testing and validation, production and process evaluation. This results in potentially long lead times to achieve customer and industry established approvals. Our innovation-led growth strategy focuses on translating the inherent strengths of our product technologies such as flexibility, resilience, impact and moisture resistance, and aesthetics (clarity and haptics) to target opportunities in which we can expand and/or have the potential to create new market spaces for our solutions.
Cariflex. Prior to the sale of our Cariflex business, we produced Cariflex IR and IRL. Cariflex products were based on synthetic polyisoprene polymer and did not contain natural rubber latex or other natural rubber products, making them an ideal substitute for natural rubber latex, particularly in applications with high purity requirements such as medical, healthcare, personal care, and food contact. Cariflex is included in our results of operations through March 6, 2020.
Isoprene Rubber. In connection with the sale of our Cariflex business, we entered into the IRSA with DL Chemical, under the terms of which we will supply IR to DL Chemical for a period of five years, with an optional extension for an additional five years. As the IRSA product sales are at cost, we deferred approximately $180.6 million of the aggregate purchase price for our Cariflex business. The deferred income will be amortized into revenue as a non-cash transaction when the products are sold. See Note 4 Disposition and Exit of Business Activities for further discussion of the IRSA.
CHEMICAL SEGMENT PRODUCTS AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
We manufacture and sell sustainable, high value products primarily derived from pine wood pulping co-products. We refine and further upgrade two primary feedstocks, crude tall oil (“CTO”) and crude sulfate turpentine (“CST”), both of which are co-products of the wood pulping process, into value-added biobased specialty chemicals. We refine CTO through a distillation process into four primary constituent fractions: tall oil fatty acids (“TOFA”); tall oil rosin (“TOR”); distilled tall oil (“DTO”); and tall oil pitch. We further upgrade TOFA and TOR into derivatives such as dimer acids, polyamide resins, rosin resins, dispersions, and disproportionated resins. We refine CST into terpene monomer fractions, which can be further upgraded into specialty terpene resins. The various fractions and derivatives resulting from our CTO and CST refining process provide for distinct functionalities and properties, determining their respective applications and end markets. Our products derived from CTO and CST offer sustainable, non-genetically modified (“GMO”), bio-based alternatives.
Our Chemical segment is based predominantly on the refining and upgrading of CTO and CST. We also have the capacity to upgrade hydrocarbon-based raw materials, such as alpha-methyl-styrene (“AMS”), and bio-based gum rosins, where appropriate, and are able to offer tailored solutions for our customers.
The segment’s products are manufactured and our commercial activities are organized in the following product groups based upon end markets and process technologies: Adhesives, Performance Chemicals, and Tires.
Adhesives. We offer a broad range of products to service target adhesives submarkets, including rosin-based tackifiers for packaging and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, terpene-based tackifiers for bookbinding, hygiene and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, AMS resins for bookbinding and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, and hot melt polyamides for flexible packaging, industrial applications, and road marking. We seek to position our renewable, non-GMO, bio-based offerings as the material of choice for producers seeking to meet consumer demand for products that do not use less sustainable and GMO materials, like hydrocarbon-based solutions. We provide rosin based tackifiers with similar performance to hydrocarbon-based alternatives. 
Our tackifiers are primarily used in hot melt adhesives, which are heavily used in the packaging submarket. Our focus in packaging is to improve our competitive position by introducing higher quality tackifiers that work in new polymer systems. We believe our efforts to improve functionality of tackifier offerings will enable differentiated and profitable growth in emerging markets. 
Roads and Construction. Within the pavement marking submarket, we provide rosin-based binders for the thermoplastic pavement marking submarket and produce insoluble maleic-based tackifiers. We believe our advanced bio-based offerings in the pavement marking submarket enable our customers to formulate more durable road markings, improving sustainability by lessening raw material use.
Performance Chemicals. We serve various submarkets with a wide product offering, providing value across several different applications including, among others, fuel additives, oilfield chemicals, mining fluids, coatings, and metalworking fluids and lubricants. Our products include:
TOFA. Compared to other fatty acids obtained from various vegetable and animal origins, TOFA has a chemical composition characterized by distinctive features used as components in various applications. For example: 
End use market(examples) | Features 
Coatings | •serves as a binder in solvent-based paints as well as in hybrid coatings•preferred over soybean oil due to its higher unsaturation, better reactivity, flexibility, compatibility, and superior sustainability
Mining | •lower viscosity and higher affinity with the ore extract allows for a higher recovery yield•preferred over oleic acid 
Oilfield chemicals | •easier handling, better solubility in drilling muds, as well as higher surface activity and emulsifying power•preferred over oleic acid 
Fuel additives | •improves the lubricity of low-sulfur diesel fuel, preventing engine fuel pump wear 

Dimer Acids. Our dimer acids are used for the production of polyamide resins used in applications such as epoxy coatings, flexographic inks, and high performance adhesive applications. In addition, dimer acids are building blocks in the production of corrosion inhibitors and emulsifiers used in the production and recovery of petroleum and natural gas. Our dimer acids compete with dimer acids derived from other feedstocks such as rapeseed and cottonseed oil.
TOR. TOR is used in all major rosin applications for the manufacture of adhesives, inks, pavement markers, rubber, and paper.
DTO. DTO is a mixture of TOFA and rosin acids. Our DTO is primarily used as an emulsifier for metalworking fluids and lubricants, in which our product offers improved performance attributes and, in many cases, offers a more sustainable alternative by replacing less environmentally friendly hydrocarbon-based chemicals. In these applications, it is sometimes used in place of TOFA.
Terpene Fractions. We supply terpene fractions, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, and upgrade them mainly as specialty tackifiers for the adhesives market and tread enhancers for the tires market.
Tires. We sell a range of products that enhance the performance and manufacturing of high performance, winter, and all-season tires. Our terpene-based tread enhancement resins optimize wet grip of tire treads while maintaining reduced rolling resistance and enhanced durability which contribute to improved vehicle fuel efficiency. We market our AMS-based tread enhancement additives through product attributes that include reduced rolling resistance, increased durability, wet grip enhancement, and exceptional compatibility with rubber compounds, especially solution styrene-butadiene rubber polymers. We also sell TOFA, DTO, and rosins as processing aids, which provide select functionalities at various steps in the rubber and tire manufacturing process.
We were one of the first companies to supply tread enhancement resins to the tire industry and won early qualifications with innovative tire manufacturers. We believe our tires products are a key enabler for our customers to achieve their sustainability goals. The quest for improved fuel economy has prompted the introduction of silica-based “green tires” in which certain of our products are a key component. AMS resins were the first tread enhancement additive commercialized beyond basic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and we believe they offer a good balance of properties, price, and performance for current generation tires. Our SYLVATRAXXTM terpene-base tread enhancement additives are made of up to 100% bio-renewable materials.
GENERAL
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,751 employees worldwide, the majority of which were substantial full-time employees. We have collective bargaining agreements in place in multiple global Kraton locations, and employee representatives or employee representative bodies, such as works councils, are established at Kraton facilities across the world. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 23.4% of our employees in the United States were unionized.
To remain a leading global producer of specialty polymers and high-value biobased products derived from pine wood pulping co-products, it is crucial that we continue to attract new and retain our current talent. Through our diverse and inclusive workplace, our comprehensive compensation and benefits, our career management, and our focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives.
Diversity and Inclusion. Innovation at Kraton stems from the diverse perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our employees. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where all employees are treated with dignity and respect. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. Of our independent directors, 57% are female, 14% are ethnically diverse and 14% are based outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 20% of Kraton’s full-time executive positions and 23% of full-time employees, globally. Our workforce is globally diverse, with approximately 64% working in North America, 29% in Europe, 1% in South America and 6% in Asia. Our board of directors has ongoing oversight of our diversity and inclusion programs. 
Total Rewards. To ensure a compelling total rewards philosophy and practice, we have practices in place to deliver fair and equitable compensation to employees based on their role, contribution, and performance. All full-time employees are covered by a health care package, as applicable in their particular country, and all full-time employees have access to paid annual leave and company-paid holidays, based on the particular country in which they live.
Career Management. Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and remain a leading global producer of innovative products. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities. Particularly, our career development framework enables leaders and team members to identify career paths and opportunities. The individual development plan is the first step in this framework. Employees take ownership of their career development in consultation with their leaders and create a plan covering an appropriate time frame, given the person’s individual situation. We also conduct an annual assessment of individual performance and provide skills and leadership development training. In 2021, 100% of our eligible employees received an annual performance review. 
Health, Safety and Wellness. The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance, and mental health of our employees is fundamental to our success. We are committed to ensuring that employees have a safe working environment. We conduct internal audits on health and safety issues at our locations. We provide protective equipment to all impacted employees and conduct recurring employee health and detailed safety risk assessments. We also offer training of relevant employees on health and safety risks and best working practices. All of our sites are certified as having either a responsible care management or environmental management system in place. Some sites have both certifications.
Throughout the year, we support the physical, financial, and mental wellbeing of all of our employees around the world through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other benefits. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee wellbeing, health, and safety. Among other actions, we continued the meetings of our COVID-19 crisis management team to provide guidance to the organization as we navigate the challenges presented by the pandemic. We have also continued work-from-home requirements, social-distancing, restrictions on visitors to our facilities, and limited in-person meetings and other gatherings. See COVID-19 Pandemic included in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sales and Marketing
Our business is predominantly based on a short sales cycle. We sell our products through a number of channels, including a direct sales force, marketing representatives, and distributors. We use third-party marketing representatives and distributors in markets where they have existing platforms and are more cost effective in completing market coverage. We have long-term relationships and a wide network of distributors across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.
Our sales personnel are primarily responsible for maintaining relationships with our customer base and providing product advice. In general, they coordinate contact between our customers and our research and development personnel to provide quality control and new product solutions. Our close interaction with our customers has allowed us to develop and maintain what we consider to be strong customer relationships.
Our customers are facing increasing demands for more sustainable products and solutions. As a bio-based supplier of specialty chemicals and as a producer of specialty polymers that provides alternatives to non-recyclable materials, as well as solutions that can facilitate the circular economy, we believe we are positioned to benefit from these developing market trends.
Competition
In each of our markets, we compete on a range of factors, including price, breadth of product availability, product quality, sustainability features, and the speed of service from order to delivery. We believe our customers also base their supply decisions on the supplier’s ability to design and produce customized products and the availability of technical support. We also compete against a broad range of alternative materials throughout our product groups, including petrochemical, animal and vegetable-based substitutes. Major competitors in our market include large domestic and international companies. No one or small number of competitors is dominant across all industries in which we compete and no single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use butadiene, styrene, and isoprene as our primary raw materials in our Polymer segment and CTO and CST in our Chemical segment as our primary raw materials. 
For our Polymer segment, we procure our raw materials from multiple sources in the U.S. and foreign countries, through a range of short-term and long-term supply agreements. 
For our Chemical segment, we have an exclusive long-term supply contract with International Paper, which extends through 2027, under which it has agreed to sell to us, and we have agreed to purchase from it, all of the CTO and CST produced at its paper mills. We also maintain long-standing relationships with other major suppliers of our raw materials in the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, our CTO supply sources are further diversified by our ability to refine and process black liquor soap into CTO in the U.S. Most of our Chemical segment manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to the facilities of our raw material suppliers, allowing us to procure our raw materials at a low delivered cost. Furthermore, we work directly with our suppliers at their production facilities to enhance their CTO and CST yields through technological improvements, which we believe allows us to maximize our raw material supplies, to improve the efficiency of our suppliers’ operations, and to foster strong, long-lasting relationships with them.
We believe that raw material supplies for both segments will be available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in 2022. The cost of these raw materials has generally correlated with changes in energy prices and is generally influenced by supply and demand factors, and for our isoprene monomers the prices of natural and synthetic rubber. Each of our reportable segments were impacted in 2021 by the inflationary environment of raw material costs and these conditions may continue in 2022.
Research, Development, and Technology
Our primary research and development activities are conducted in laboratories in Almere, Netherlands; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Houston, Texas; Savannah, Georgia; and Shanghai, China. We also have a world class facility located at our Belpre, Ohio, site that accelerates polymer development efforts and the commercialization of new products and reduces customer qualification lead times. In addition to our core research activities, research and development personnel also support maintenance of ongoing business activities and other support functions. The below details our significant research and development activities:
Core research and development 
•new product and process development
•technical support and new application development
•technology platform development
Business support
•safety and regulatory compliance
•operations and quality support
•technical support to sales team and customers
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Other Intellectual Property Rights
We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights to conduct our business, including patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. We had 787 granted patents and 252 pending patent applications at December 31, 2021. These patents protect our innovative technologies and applications against infringement, and create long-term, sustainable competitive advantages in our core growth markets. Since patents are generally in effect for a period of 20 years from the filing date, and therefore, assuming 
most of these applications will be granted, we expect a significant portion of our patent portfolio to remain in effect for a significant period. The granted patents and the applications cover both the U.S. and foreign countries. We do not expect that the expiration of any single patent or specific group of patents would have a material impact on our business, and the overall profitability of our business is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license, or franchise.
Our material trademarks will remain in effect unless we decide to abandon any of them, subject to possible third-party claims challenging our rights. Similarly, our trade secrets will preserve their status as such for as long as they are the subject of reasonable efforts, on our part, to maintain their secrecy. We maintain a number of trade names that are protected by trademark laws.
Governmental Regulation
Our operations in the U.S. and abroad are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations at the international, national, state, and local levels. Matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; and Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to health, safety, environmental, risk reduction, and security matters. We incurred capital expenditures in 2021 for regulatory purposes of $8.0 million and estimate such expenditures will be approximately $4.0 million in 2022 and $4.0 million in 2023.
Costs of remediation at our current and former facilities are covered by indemnification agreements, insurance or through allocated reserves. We currently estimate that the costs of remediation will not materially affect our operations or cause us to materially exceed our anticipated level of capital expenditures. Although resolution of environmental liabilities will require future cash outlays, it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position, although there can be no assurance that such impacts would not occur.
Many of our products and operations are subject to laws of the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported. These laws include the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation in the European Union. REACH places great responsibility on companies to manage the risks that chemical substances may pose to health and the environment by requiring additional testing, documentation, risk assessments and registrations. These registrations of our chemical substances are a license to operate and are a prerequisite for the Company to manufacture or import our products in the European Union. The Company has successfully registered all required chemical substances to allow manufacturing and import of Kraton products into the European Union. The Company is also actively preparing for future registration needs. The cost of compliance with any new laws or regulations cannot be estimated until the manner in which they will be implemented has been precisely defined.
Seasonality
Seasonal changes and weather conditions typically affect our sales of products in our paving, pavement marking, roofing, and construction applications, which generally results in higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the calendar year compared to the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Sales for our other product applications tend to show relatively little seasonality.
