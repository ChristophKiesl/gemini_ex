Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 22, 2021 and formed for the purpose of purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
On January 26, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000 in consideration for 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares (the “founder shares”). The outstanding founder shares included an aggregate of up to 750,000 shares subject to forfeiture by our Sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that our Sponsor would collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering (assuming our Sponsor did not purchase any public shares in our initial public offering). On May 11, 2021, 750,000 founder shares were forfeited by the Sponsor.
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on March 22, 2021. On March 25, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 20,000,000 units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000. Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant ("public warrant"). Each public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 6,000,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement (the “private placement warrants”) to our Sponsor, Magnum Opus Holdings LLC, generating gross proceeds of $6,000,000. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants were added to the net proceeds from the initial public offering held in a trust account. If we do not complete a business combination within 24 months from the consummation of the initial public offering, the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law).
We had granted the underwriter in the initial public offering a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,000,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. In May 2021, the underwriters' over-allotment option expired.
The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account if we do not consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of our initial public offering plus the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued or to be issued to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, its affiliates or any member of our management team upon conversion of any working capital loans. In no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one.
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict whether investors

will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter or (2) our annual revenues are less than $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
Proposed Business Combination
On August 26, 2021, the Company, Integrated Whale Media Investment Inc., a BVI business company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, in its capacity as a seller (“IWM”), and shareholders’ representative (the “Shareholders’ Representative”), Highlander Management LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in the State of Delaware (“Highlander,” and together with IWM, the “Sellers”), Forbes Global Holdings Inc., a BVI business company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IWM (“FGH”), and Forbes entered into a business combination agreement (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”). FGH is an intermediate holding company between IWM and Forbes that directly owns 95% of the share capital of Forbes and does not otherwise have its own operations. Highlander directly owns the remaining 5% of the share capital of Forbes. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, (A) the Company will purchase (i) all of the share capital of FGH from IWM and thus, indirectly, 95% of the share capital of Forbes held directly by FGH and (ii) the remaining 5% of the share capital of Forbes from Highlander and (B) all of the outstanding options of Forbes held by each optionholder (the “Optionholders”) (whether vested or unvested) as of the closing of the Business Combination will be cancelled, in each case, in exchange for a combination of cash and newly issued ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, valued at $10.00 per share. Following the consummation of the transactions, the Company will directly or indirectly hold 100% of the issued share capital of FGH and Forbes.
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable to IWM, Highlander and the Optionholders will be valued at $620,000,000, subject to adjustments for cash and cash equivalents, indebtedness and net working capital of the target companies relative to a target as of the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), which will be paid in a combination of cash and shares of the Company. The Closing Consideration will be allocated among IWM, Highlander and Optionholders on a pro rata basis based on their relative direct or indirect, fully diluted ownership of Forbes (with respect to the Optionholders, on a net “cashless” exercise basis). The aggregate cash consideration will be an amount equal to the Company’s proceeds in connection with a private placement for $10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $400,000,000 (the “Private Placement”) and the funds in the Company’s trust account as of the Closing, plus cash and cash equivalents of the target companies, minus unpaid transaction expenses of the Company as of the Closing, minus transaction expenses of the Sellers and the target companies as of the Closing, minus $145,000,000. The remainder of the Closing Consideration will be paid in a number of newly issued ordinary shares of the Company valued at $10.00 per share. At the Closing, the Company will deposit with an escrow agent an amount equal to $5,000,000 of the cash consideration, which will be disbursed following the final determination of the Closing Consideration.

Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, our Initial Shareholders and IWM entered into a support agreement (the “Support Agreement”), pursuant to which each Initial Shareholder has agreed to, among other things, vote to adopt and approve the Business Combination Agreement and the other documents contemplated thereby and the transactions contemplated thereby, not transfer any share of the Company until termination of the Support Agreement, waive or not otherwise perfect any anti-dilution or similar protection with respect to any Founder shares and not elect to have any share of the Company redeemed in connection with the transactions.
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, our Initial Shareholders, IWM and Highlander entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). On February 10, 2022, the Company, the Sponsor, IWM and Binance entered into an amended and restated investor rights agreement (the “Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement”), which amended and replaced the original Investor Rights Agreement dated as of August 26, 2021 in its entirety. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement, (i) the board of directors of the post-combination company shall be comprised of nine (9) directors at and immediately following the Closing, of which one individual shall be nominated by the Sponsor, two individuals shall be nominated by IWM, one individual shall be the chief executive officer of combined company, two individuals shall be nominated by Binance and three individuals shall be jointly nominated by unanimous agreement of the Sponsor, IWM and Binance; (ii) the board of directors of the post-combination company shall be divided into three classes of directors, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms; (iii) the Company will agree to undertake certain resale shelf registration obligations in accordance with the Securities Act and certain holders have been granted customary demand and piggyback registration rights; (iv) each party to the to the Amended and Restated Investor Rights Agreement (including parties to the original Investor Rights Agreement) agrees to a twelve (12)-month lock-up period following the Closing for the shares and warrants of the Company owned by such party, subject to certain customary exceptions; and (v) the Company shall form a steering committee, including two directors nominated by Binance and any other directors as may be determined by the New Forbes Board from time to time, who will advise and provide insights to the management team and the board on recent developments in cryptocurrencies and related assets to inform the Company’s digital media coverage and product development strategies.
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (the "Initial PIPE Investors"), pursuant to which the Initial PIPE Investors have agreed to, in connection with the Closing, purchase an aggregate of 40,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company in a private placement for $10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $400,000,000. On February 1, 2022, Binance Capital Management Co., Ltd., a business company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Binance”, and together with other Initial PIPE Investors that did not assign their obligations under the subscription agreements, the “PIPE Investors”), agreed to invest $200,000,000 in the Private Placement by assuming from certain of the Initial PIPE Investors all or a portion of their obligations under their respective subscription agreements to purchase an aggregate of 20,000,000 Class A ordinary shares of the Company in a private placement for $10.00 per share. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates will not participate in the Private Placement. The proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to partially fund the cash consideration to be paid to IWM, Highlander and the Optionholders at the Closing and transaction expenses of the Company, Sellers and target companies, with any remainder used to fund working capital of post-combination company. Under the Subscription Agreements, the obligations of the parties (or, in some cases, some of the parties) to consummate the Private Placement are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, (i) the absence of a legal prohibition on consummating the Private Placement; (ii) all conditions precedent under the Business Combination Agreement having been satisfied or waived; (iii) the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects; and (iv) material compliance with covenants.
On November 22, 2021, we filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A relating to the Business Combination (the "Proxy Statement"). The Business Combination is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to approval by our shareholders and other customary closing conditions.
Our publicly traded Class A ordinary shares, public units and public warrants are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols "OPA," "OPA.U" and "OPA WS," respectively. We intend to apply to continue the listing of our public shares and public warrants on the NYSE under the symbols "FRBS" and "FRBSW," respectively, upon the Closing.
Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to the initial public offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions 

7



cannot be amended without a special resolution. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where it has been approved by either (i) at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given; or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two-thirds of our shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders.
Our Initial Shareholders will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:

● | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per- share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less franchise and income taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law;

● | Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on our initial business combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or our officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide we will not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of the initial public offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets requirement.
The Companies Act permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval of a special resolution. A company’s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but, provided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provides otherwise.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
We currently utilize office space at Unit 1009, IBC Tower, Three Garden Road, Central, Hong Kong as our executive offices. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have three officers: Jonathan Lin, our Chief Executive Officer, Frank Han, our President, and Kevin Lee, our Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been elected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding 

9



adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
