ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organization
GreenSky, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on July 12, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of completing an initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock and certain Reorganization Transactions in order to carry on the business of GreenSky Holdings, LLC (“GS Holdings”) and its consolidated subsidiaries. GS Holdings, a holding company with no operating assets or operations, was organized in August 2017. On August 24, 2017, GS Holdings acquired a controlling interest in GreenSky, LLC ("GSLLC"), a Georgia limited liability company, which is an operating entity. See Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a detailed discussion of the Reorganization Transactions, as defined in that footnote, and the IPO.
Unless the context requires otherwise, "we," "us," "our," "GreenSky" and "the Company" refer to GreenSky, Inc. and its subsidiaries. "Bank Partners" are defined as federally insured banks that originate loans under the consumer financing and payments program that we administer for use by merchants on behalf of such banks in connection with which we provide point-of-sale financing and payments technology and related marketing, servicing, collection and other services (the "GreenSky program" or "program").
Company Overview
GreenSky is a leading U.S.-based technology company enabling frictionless promotional financing at the point of sale for a growing ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners. Our Company was founded on the idea that payment, credit and commerce could be enhanced using technology delivered via an elegant user experience. We believe payment and credit can be an asset that empowers and enables commerce, not a distraction or impediment. Our mission is to help businesses grow and delight their customers. For specific key developments and results during the year ended December 31, 2019, see "Executive Summary–2019 Developments" and "Executive Summary–2019 Results" in Part II, Item 7.


The way in which we conduct our business is guided by our core values:
Our business model, built upon repeat and growing usage by merchants, allows us to generate recurring revenues with limited customer acquisition and marketing costs, resulting in attractive unit economics and strong margins. We derive most of our revenue and profitability from upfront transaction fees that merchants pay us every time they facilitate a transaction using our platform. Thus, our profitability is strongly correlated with merchant transaction volume. The transaction fee rate depends on the terms of financing underlying the consumer loans. In addition, we collect servicing fees on the loan portfolios we service for our Bank Partners and share, indirectly, in the excess profitability, if any, of the loan portfolios we facilitate for our Bank Partners.
We developed and have been advancing and refining our proprietary, purpose-built platform to provide significant benefits to our growing ecosystem of merchants, consumers and Bank Partners. Our platform enables each of these constituents to benefit from enhanced access to each other and to our technology, resulting in a virtuous cycle of increasing engagement and value creation. We believe our ecosystem grows stronger with scale.
Merchants. Merchants using our platform presently range from small, owner-operated home improvement contractors and healthcare providers to large national home improvement brands and retailers and healthcare service organizations. The value proposition to merchants leveraging our scalable, proprietary technology platform includes: 
•Increased sales volume. By facilitating low or deferred interest promotional point-of-sale financing and payments solutions for their customers, merchants enhance their sales volume potential through higher conversion from bid to contract, and increased ticket size.
•Seamless integration. Our platform is designed to provide a seamless experience for our merchants with a mobile-native design that is intuitive, easy to use and integrates effortlessly with merchants’ existing payments systems. We settle payments through a national credit card payment network or through the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) network, meaning merchants that already accept these types of payments require no systems integration to adopt our platform. This frictionless onboarding makes consumer point-of-sale financing available for merchants of all sizes. 
•Accelerated funding. Our merchants typically receive a sizable portion of their funding faster than they would if they were paid in installments in a more traditional 30-day billing cycle.
•Agility. We work creatively and collaboratively to design, configure and manage promotional financing offers that fulfill the evolving and competitive needs of our merchants while continuing to improve our solutions to appeal to their customers.
Consumers. Consumers who transact on our platform typically have super-prime or prime credit scores and find financing with promotional terms to be an attractive alternative to other forms of payment, particularly in the case of larger purchases. We provide a completely paperless, mobile-enabled experience that typically permits a consumer to apply and be approved for financing in less than 60 seconds at the point of sale. The value proposition to consumers includes:
•Superior experience. Because we are able to process an application and approve financing at the point of sale with limited burden on the consumer, our platform enables consumers to “apply and buy” in most cases in less than 60 seconds, utilizing an intuitive mobile interface and paperless loan agreement. 
•Promotional interest rates and terms. The majority of the loans facilitated by our platform carry promotional financing with deferred interest or reduced-rate terms, an attractive alternative relative to typical financing rates on credit card accounts.
•Enables larger purchases. By allowing merchants to market to their customers by focusing on the monthly cost of their purchases rather than the one-time upfront cash outlays, consumers are able to better budget for larger purchases.
•Preserves revolving credit availability. Rather than utilizing revolving credit for large purchases, which results in available credit lines being reduced, the loans we facilitate preserve credit card availability for everyday purchases.
Bank Partners. Bank Partners in our ecosystem have access to our proprietary technology solution and merchant network, enabling them to build a diversified nationwide portfolio of high-quality consumer loans with attractive risk-adjusted yields. Our platform delivers significant loan volume, while requiring minimal upfront investment by our Bank Partners. Furthermore, our program is designed to adhere to the regulatory and compliance standards of our Bank Partners, which has helped us to gain their confidence, allowing them to outsource both loan facilitation and servicing functions to us. The value proposition to our Bank Partners includes:
•Consumer credit exposure at attractive risk-adjusted yields. We believe loans originated on our platform offer strong net interest margin, credit performance and duration characteristics relative to financing institutions' other unsecured consumer lending opportunities.
•Nationally diversified, small-balance loans. While many of our Bank Partners may traditionally focus on lending opportunities within their geographic footprints, our platform enables them to originate loans in all 50 states, with an average loan size of approximately $9,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019, thus creating an efficient mechanism to aggregate a granular, diversified national portfolio.
•Access to our proprietary technology and merchant network. Over the past decade, we built and refined our technology platform to deliver significant value to merchants and consumers. We also cultivated strong relationships with "Sponsors" and merchants. "Sponsors" refers to manufacturers, their captive and franchised showroom operations, and trade associations with which we partner to onboard merchants. We believe our Bank Partners would require significant time and investment to build such a technology solution and merchant network themselves.
•No customer acquisition cost and limited operating expenses. Our platform alleviates the need for our Bank Partners to bear any marketing, software development or technology infrastructure costs to originate loans.
•Robust compliance framework. We continuously refine and upgrade our platform, risk management and servicing capabilities to meet the compliance, documentation and vendor management requirements of our Bank Partners and their regulators.
Our Platform
Our platform is powered by a proprietary, patent-pending technology infrastructure that delivers stability, speed, scalability and security. It supports the full transaction lifecycle, including credit application, underwriting, real-time loan allocation to our Bank Partners, document distribution, funding, settlement and servicing, and it can be expanded to additional industry verticals and origination channels as we scale our business. 
We believe our technology platform creates meaningful barriers to entry for other providers attempting to reach the same scale with merchants, consumers and funding partners. These attributes include: 
•Intuitive user interface. We designed our digital platform to be simple and easy to use.
•Paperless application and documentation environment. Our platform populates applications using a mobile device’s location data and a scan of the consumer’s driver license, eliminating unnecessary effort. Once the application is approved, a digital loan agreement is delivered in real time, generally back to the same mobile device. The consumer accepts the terms of the agreement through electronic signature, eliminating the need for a physical signature.
•Capacity to support a wide range of promotional financing solutions. Our technology enables merchants of all sizes and their sales associates to select among several promotional financing solutions based on customer preferences.
•Significant flexibility and processing capabilities. Our technology stack includes an “Application Tier” (multiple user-facing applications) and a dynamic “Database Tier” (real-time algorithmic underwriting and processing functionality, data archiving, lookup and reporting). Together, this results in a comprehensive technology solution that supports the full transaction lifecycle.
•Real-time credit decisions and placement with a Bank Partner. We developed an algorithm that underwrites potential loans against the specified credit criteria of each of our Bank Partners. Once loan applications are underwritten and matched against the Bank Partners’ credit criteria, a proprietary digital “round-robin” system allocates each unique approved loan to a Bank Partner.
•Automated regulatory compliance. During the underwriting process, our systems instantly check applicants against national databases designed to identify potential fraud, money laundering and other “red flags.”
•Integration into payments network. We settle and fund transactions on a national credit card network or via the ACH system, allowing merchants to adopt our digital platform without any capital expenditure or back-end payment systems integration.
•System of record and loan servicing. Our technology maintains the system of record for the portfolio of each of our Bank Partners, whereby details of all loans initiated, funded and serviced are maintained in a secure, online, user-accessible environment.
•Scalable digital platform. Because each feature of our platform is digitally-enabled, we can efficiently adapt to the changing preferences of our constituents and achieve greater scale.
Enterprise Risk Management
GreenSky operates in a highly regulated industry. In addition, our relationships with our merchants and third-party vendors subject us to a variety of regulatory, financial and reputational risks. The Company developed and implemented a comprehensive Compliance Management System to maintain compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the GreenSky program and designed to adapt to our evolving business strategy and operations. In addition, we have developed a proprietary complaints management system to identify, document and remediate customer complaints promptly and efficiently.
•Merchant Management. Prior to enrollment for participation in the GreenSky program, merchants undergo rigorous vetting and underwriting. Thereafter, merchants are subject to continued review through our Merchant Risk Management, Compliance Management and Complaints Management programs. Each of these programs is designed to prevent, detect and mitigate financial and reputational risks brought to the GreenSky program by merchants.
•Customer Satisfaction. We routinely place outbound customer satisfaction calls and emails to sample populations of borrowers as part of our ongoing merchant reevaluation and review process. This process includes dedicated outbound call campaigns to vulnerable populations, including seniors. We have a team of GreenSky Customer Advocates who work to resolve any borrower dissatisfaction with merchants. We make use of multiple communication channels to ensure borrower awareness of account activity, including welcome emails, account alerts and outbound calls.
•Bank Partners. We engage with bank partners that seek attractive risk-adjusted yields and portfolio diversification through exposure to high quality consumer credit. For the GreenSky program, each of our Bank Partners has directed a proprietary credit policy, which is grounded in proven, established credit performance attributes and is designed to incorporate the credit performance of a full economic cycle. Our proprietary technology platform instantly adjudicates on each application using transparent and verifiable credit criteria and allocates each loan based on the credit guidelines of our Bank Partners.
Intellectual Property, Patents and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors and other parties with whom we conduct business to control use and access to, and limit disclosure of, our proprietary information. In 2014, we submitted a patent application relating to our mobile application process and credit decisioning model, which application is currently pending. There is no assurance that our patent application will be granted. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States. We also own the domain name rights for "greensky.com", as well as other words and phrases important to our business. 
For additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property, see Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition
The consumer credit and payments market is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving, subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight and highly competitive. We face competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions and credit card issuers, as well as alternative technology-enabled lenders. Many of our credit and payment competitors are (or are affiliated with) financial institutions with the capacity to hold loans on their balance sheets, increasing the potential profitability of individual consumer relationships. Some of these competitors offer a broader suite of products and services than we do, including retail banking solutions, credit and debit cards and loyalty programs. 
We compete for merchants based on a number of key product features, including price, duration, simplicity of loan terms, promotional terms, ease of applying, merchant fees, user experience and time-to-funding. Our existing core unsecured term loan products face competition primarily from home equity lines of credit and general-purpose revolving credit cards. Consumers can access these alternatives through a range of traditional and 
technology-enabled sources. We expect competition to continue to increase as many traditional, large-scale consumer lenders are investing in technology to streamline loan application and funding processes. We also expect to face additional competition from current competitors or others who embrace new technologies to significantly change the consumer credit and payment industry.
Seasonality
Our business is generally subject to seasonality in consumer spending and payment patterns. Given that our home improvement vertical is a significant contributor to our overall revenue, our revenue generally is higher during the second and third quarters of the year as the weather improves, the residential real estate market becomes more active and consumers begin home improvement projects. During these periods, we tend to experience increased loan applications and, in turn, transaction volume. Conversely, our revenue generally slows during the first and fourth quarters of the year, as consumer spending on home improvement projects tends to slow leading up to the holiday season and through the winter months. As a result, the volume of loan applications and transactions also tends to slow during these periods. The elective healthcare vertical is susceptible to seasonality during the fourth quarter of the year, as the licensed healthcare providers take more vacation time around the holiday season. During this period, the volume of elective healthcare procedures and our resulting revenue tend to slow relative to other periods throughout the year. Our seasonality trends may vary in the future as we introduce our program to new industry verticals and become less concentrated in the home improvement industry. 
The origination related and finance charge reversal components of our cost of revenue (further discussed in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8) also are subject to these same seasonal factors, while the servicing related component of cost of revenue, in particular customer service staffing, printing and postage costs, is not as closely correlated to seasonal volume patterns. As transaction volume increases, the transaction volume related personnel costs, as well as costs related to credit and identity verification, among other activities, increase as well. Further, finance charge reversal settlements are positively correlated with transaction volume in the same period of the prior year. As prepayments on deferred interest loans, which trigger finance charge reversals, typically are highest towards the end of the promotional period, and promotional periods are most commonly 12, 18 or 24 months, finance charge reversal settlements follow a similar seasonal pattern as transaction volumes over the course of a calendar year. 
Lastly, we have observed seasonal patterns in consumer credit, driven to an extent by income tax refunds, which results in lower charge-offs during the second and third quarters of the year. Credit improvement during these periods has a positive impact on the incentive payments we receive from our Bank Partners. Conversely, during the first and fourth quarters of the year, when credit performance is comparably lower, our incentive payment receipts are negatively impacted, which in turn has a negative impact on our cost of revenue.
Significant Customers
Our top ten merchants (including certain groups of affiliated merchants) accounted for an aggregate of 22% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Home Depot is our most significant single merchant and represented approximately 4% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, affiliates of Renewal by Andersen, our largest Sponsor, such affiliates including both Andersen Corporation-owned licensed dealers and approximately 80 independently owned and operated Renewal by Andersen licensed dealers, represented together approximately 16% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect to have significant concentration in our largest merchant relationships for the foreseeable future. In the event that (i) The Home Depot or one or more of our other significant merchants, or groups of merchants, or (ii) Renewal by Andersen or one or more of our other significant Sponsors, and their dealers, terminate their relationships with us, or elect to utilize an alternative source for financing, the number of loans originated through the GreenSky program likely would decline, which would materially adversely affect our business and, in turn, our revenue.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, GreenSky had 1,174 full-time employees, with substantially all employees located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia and Crescent Hills, Kentucky. We also engage temporary employees and consultants as needed to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
