Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 Cabot is a global specialty chemicals and performance materials company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Our principal products are reinforcing and specialty carbons, specialty compounds, fumed metal oxides, activated carbons, inkjet colorants, and aerogel. Cabot and its affiliates have manufacturing facilities and operations in the United States (“U.S.”) and over 20 other countries. Cabot’s business was founded in 1882 and incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1960. The terms “Cabot”, “Company”, “we”, and “our” as used in this report refer to Cabot Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Our “advancing the core” corporate strategy is to extend our leadership in performance materials by investing for growth in our core businesses, driving application innovation with our customers, and generating strong cash flows through efficiency and optimization. Our products are generally based on technical expertise and innovation in one or more of our four core competencies: making and handling very fine particles; modifying the surfaces of very fine particles to alter their functionality; designing particles to impart specific properties to a formulation; and combining particles with other ingredients to deliver a formulated performance intermediate or composite. We focus on creating particles, and formulations of those particles, with the composition, morphology, and surface functionalities to deliver the requisite performance to support our customers’ existing and emerging applications.
 Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Reinforcement Materials; Performance Chemicals; and Purification Solutions. On November 25, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell our Purification Solutions business, which we expect to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Upon the consummation of this transaction, our business will be organized into two reportable segments. Our business segments are discussed in more detail later in this section.
 Our internet address is www.cabotcorp.com. We make available free of charge on or through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with, or furnishing it to, the SEC. Information appearing on our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated in, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Reinforcement Materials
 Products
 Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications. Reinforcing carbons (a class of carbon blacks manufactured by Cabot) are used to enhance the physical properties of the systems and applications in which they are incorporated.
 Our reinforcing carbons products are used in tires and industrial products. Reinforcing carbons have traditionally been used in the tire industry as a rubber reinforcing agent to increase tread durability and are also used as a performance additive to reduce rolling resistance and improve traction. In industrial products such as hoses, belts, extruded profiles and molded goods, reinforcing carbons are used to improve the physical performance of the product, including the product’s physical strength, fluid resistance, conductivity and resistivity.
 In addition to our reinforcing carbons, we manufacture engineered elastomer composites (“E2C™”) solutions that are composites of reinforcing carbons and rubber made using our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process. These composites improve abrasion/wear resistance, reduce fatigue of rubber parts and reduce rolling resistance compared to reinforcing carbons/rubber compounds made entirely by conventional rubber mix methods enabling rubber product manufacturers to reduce the need to make performance trade-offs. Additionally, because E2C™ solutions can be integrated into current product methods without additional significant capital investment, and require fewer mixing stages, lower mixing temperatures and shorter mixing cycles than conventional products, operating and production costs may be reduced.
 Drivers of Demand and Sales and Customers
 Demand for our Reinforcement Materials products is largely driven by the growth and development of the tire and automotive industries. In addition to general global economic conditions, demand for reinforcing carbons in tires is mainly influenced by the number of replacement and original equipment tires produced, which in turn is driven by (i) vehicle and driving trends, including the number of miles driven, and the number of vehicles produced and registered, (ii) demand for high-performance tires, (iii) demand for larger tires and larger vehicles, such as trucks, buses, off-road vehicles used in agriculture, mining and similar vehicles, (iv) consumer and industrial spending on new vehicles and (v) changes in regulatory requirements impacting vehicle fuel efficiency and tire regulations. Demand for reinforcing carbons for industrial products is mainly influenced by vehicle production and design trends, construction activity and general industrial production. 
 4

Demand in the developed Western European, Japanese, and North American regions is mainly driven by demographic changes, customers’ high-quality requirements, stringent tire regulation standards, changes in consumer preference (e.g., different tire sizes, model and powertrain types), and relatively stable tire replacement demand. Demand in developing markets, such as China, Southeastern Asia, South America and Eastern Europe, is mainly driven by the growing middle class, rapid industrialization, infrastructure spending and increasing car ownership trends. The growth in vehicle production in turn drives demand for both original equipment tires and replacement tires in developing regions.
 Sales of reinforcing carbons and E2C™ solutions are made primarily by Cabot employees and secondarily through distributors and sales representatives. Sales to five major tire customers represent a material portion of Reinforcement Materials’ total net sales and operating revenues. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in volumes sold to them, could have a material adverse effect on the segment.
 Under appropriate circumstances, we have entered into supply arrangements with certain customers, the typical duration of which is one year. These arrangements typically provide for sales price adjustments to account for changes in relevant feedstock indices and, in many cases, changes in other relevant costs (such as the cost of natural gas). In fiscal 2021, approximately 60% of our reinforcing carbons volume was sold under these supply arrangements. The majority of the volumes sold under these arrangements are sold to customers in the Americas and Europe.
 We licensed our patented elastomer composites manufacturing process to Manufacture Francaise des Pneumatiques Michelin for their exclusive use in tire applications through fiscal 2017, and for a period of limited exclusivity in tire applications through fiscal 2019. As consideration, we receive quarterly royalty payments extending through calendar year 2022.
 Much of the reinforcing carbons we sell is used in tires and automotive products and, therefore, our financial results may be affected by the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. However, a large portion of the market for our products is in replacement tires that historically have been less subject to automotive industry cycles.
 Competition
 We are one of the leading manufacturers of carbon black in the world. We compete in the sale of reinforcing carbons with four companies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside their region. Competition for our Reinforcement Materials products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, price, service, technical innovation, and logistics. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, global manufacturing presence, operations and logistics excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage.
Raw Materials
 The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our reinforcing carbons is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of our reinforcing carbons. Raw materials are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. Raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of our feedstocks and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. 
Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce reinforcing carbons in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and the U.S. An equity affiliate operates a reinforcing carbons plant in Venezuela. In addition, we have a 98% ownership interest in an entity that manufactures our E2C™ products in Port Dickson, Malaysia.
 The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2021 in segment operations in which we own less than 100%:

During fiscal 2019, we began engineering work on an expansion of our Cilegon, Indonesia plant, which would have added approximately 90,000 metric tons of capacity to our network. In fiscal 2020, after a review of our capital allocation priorities, we temporarily suspended further work on this expansion and currently expect to recommence work on this project at a later time.
 One of the main environmental challenges of a carbon black plant is the management of exhaust gas from production processes. This exhaust gas contains a number of regulated pollutants, including carbon monoxide and sulfur compounds. Our most common method for controlling these gases is through combustion, which produces useable energy as a by-product. Currently, nine reinforcing carbons and three reinforcing carbons/specialty carbons manufacturing sites have energy centers, which allow us to utilize these gases through some form of energy co-generation, such as the sale or reuse of steam, gas or electricity. Depending on our capacity utilization, our energy centers generally reduce our manufacturing operating costs.
 Performance Chemicals
 Our Performance Chemicals reporting segment is organized into two businesses: our Performance Additives business and our Formulated Solutions business. Our Performance Additives business combines our specialty carbons, including battery materials, fumed metal oxides and aerogel product lines, and our Formulated Solutions business combines our specialty compounds and inkjet product lines.
 In Performance Chemicals, we design, manufacture and sell materials that deliver performance in a broad range of customer applications across the automotive, construction, infrastructure, inkjet printing, electronics, and consumer products sectors and in applications related to the generation, transmission and storage of energy. Our focus areas for growth include carbon additives and other materials for battery applications (which materials we currently refer to as our “Battery Materials”, and formerly referred to as “Energy Materials”), inkjet dispersions for post print corrugated packaging applications, and conductive compounds and concentrates for various plastics applications. The investments we have made for growth in this segment, including in respect of these specific areas of focus, are described below under the heading “Operations”.
 Products
 Performance Additives Business
 Carbon black is a form of elemental carbon that is manufactured in a highly controlled process to produce particles and aggregates of varied structure and surface chemistry, resulting in many different performance characteristics for a wide variety of applications.
 Our specialty carbons are used to impart color, provide rheology control, enhance conductivity and static charge control, provide UV protection, enhance mechanical properties, and provide formulation flexibility through surface treatment. These specialty carbon products are used in a wide variety of applications, such as plastics, which applications represent the largest use for our products, inks, coatings, adhesives, toners, batteries, and displays.
 Our Battery Materials applications include our conductive carbon additives (carbon black and carbon nanotubes) and fumed metal oxides, which are used principally in advanced lead acid and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. In lithium-ion batteries, our conductive carbon additives are used in both cathode and anode applications to enable enhanced energy density over longer cycle life.
 Fumed silica is an ultra-fine, high-purity particle used as a reinforcing, thickening, abrasive, thixotropic, suspending or anti-caking agent in a wide variety of products for the automotive, construction, microelectronics, batteries, and consumer products industries. These products include adhesives, sealants, cosmetics, batteries, inks, toners, silicone elastomers, coatings, polishing slurries and pharmaceuticals. Fumed alumina, also an ultra-fine, high-purity particle, is used as an abrasive, absorbent or barrier agent in a variety of products, such as inkjet media, lighting, coatings, cosmetics and polishing slurries.
 Aerogel is a hydrophobic, silica-based particle with a high surface area that is used in a variety of thermal insulation and specialty chemical applications. In the building and construction industry, the product is used in insulative sprayable plasters and composite building products, as well as translucent skylight, window, wall and roof systems for insulating eco-daylighting applications. In the specialty chemicals industry, the product is used to provide matte finishing, insulating and thickening properties for use in a variety of applications.
 Formulated Solutions Business
 Our masterbatch and conductive compound products, which we refer to as “specialty compounds”, are formulations derived from specialty carbons mixed with polymers and other additives. These products are generally used by plastic resin producers and converters in applications for the automotive, industrial, packaging, infrastructure, agriculture, consumer products, and electronics industries. As an alternative to directly mixing specialty carbon blacks, these formulations offer greater ease of handling and help customers achieve their desired levels of dispersion and color and manage the addition of small doses of additives. In addition, our electrically conductive compound products generally are used to help ensure uniform conductive performance and reduce risks associated with electrostatic discharge in plastics applications.

Our inkjet colorants are high-quality pigment-based black and color dispersions and inks. Our dispersions are based on our patented pigment surface modification technology and polymer encapsulation technology. The dispersions are used in aqueous inkjet inks to impart color, sharp print characteristics and durability, while maintaining high printhead reliability. These products are used in various inkjet printing applications, including traditional work-from-home and corporate office settings, and, increasingly, in commercial and corrugated packaging, that all require a high level of dispersibility and colloidal stability. Our inkjet inks, which utilize our pigment-based colorant dispersions, are used in the commercial printing segment for digital print.
 Drivers of Demand and Sales and Customers
 Our specialty carbons products have a wide variety of end-uses and demand is largely driven by the growth and development of the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. Demand for our conductive carbon additives for use in batteries is largely driven by the trend in electrification of vehicles. Demand for fumed silica is mainly influenced by trends in key markets for silicones, adhesives and coatings applications, notably, structural adhesives for automobile light-weighting, epoxy bonding paste for wind turbines, high-performance coatings and hybrid sealants for construction and silicones for medical devices and the proliferation of electronics. Demand for specialty compounds is mainly influenced by growth and development of the automotive, infrastructure, consumer goods and electronical and electronic devices, packaging and agriculture industries. 
 Demand for our inkjet colorants is mainly influenced by developments in print media, pages printed in office and work-from-home environments, as well as press sales and utilization levels as digital aqueous pigment-based inks penetrate commercial and packaging applications historically served by analog printing methods. 
 Sales of these products are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives. In our specialty carbons and specialty compounds product lines, sales are generally to a broad number of customers. In our fumed metal oxides product line, sales under contracts with six customers account for approximately one-third of the revenue.
 Competition
 We are a leading producer of the products we sell in this segment. We compete in the sale of carbon black with four companies that operate globally and numerous other companies that operate regionally, a number of which export product outside their region. For battery applications, we produce conductive carbon and carbon nanotubes for both lithium ion and lead acid batteries. For battery applications, we compete primarily with two companies that operate globally that manufacture conductive carbon additives and we compete primarily with one China-based company that manufactures carbon nanotubes. For fumed silica, we compete primarily with two companies with a global presence and several other companies which have a regional presence. For aerogel, we compete principally with one other company that produces aerogel products. We also compete with non-aerogel insulation products manufactured by regional companies throughout the world. For specialty compounds, we compete with many regional companies and a small number of global companies. Our inkjet colorants and inks are designed to replace traditional pigment dispersions and dyes used in inkjet printing applications. Competitive products for inkjet colorants are organic dyes and other dispersed pigments manufactured and marketed by large chemical companies and small independent producers.
 Competition for our Performance Chemicals products is based on product performance, quality, reliability, service, technical innovation and price. We believe our product differentiation, technological leadership, operations excellence and customer service provide us with a competitive advantage.
 Raw Materials
 Raw materials for our products are, in general, readily available and in adequate supply. The principal raw material used in the manufacture of our specialty carbons is composed of residual heavy oils derived from petroleum refining operations, the distillation of coal tars, and the production of ethylene throughout the world. Natural gas is also used in the production of our specialty carbons. These raw material costs generally are influenced by the availability of various types of our feedstocks and natural gas, supply and demand of such raw materials and related transportation costs. Changes in certain of our raw material supplier’s operating conditions could reduce the availability of certain very specialized feedstocks.
 Raw materials for the production of fumed silica are various chlorosilane feedstocks. We purchase feedstocks and for certain customers convert their feedstock to product on a fee-basis (so called “toll conversion”). We also purchase aluminum chloride as feedstock for the production of fumed alumina. We have long-term procurement contracts or arrangements in place for the purchase of fumed silica feedstock primarily from fence-line partners, which we believe will enable us to meet our raw material requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we buy some raw materials in the spot market to help ensure flexibility and minimize costs. The principal raw materials for the production of aerogel are silica sol and/or sodium silicate.
 7

The primary raw materials used for our specialty compounds include carbon black, primarily sourced from our carbon black plants, prime and recycled thermoplastic resins and mineral fillers supplied from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet colorants include carbon black sourced from our carbon black plants, organic pigments and other treating agents available from various sources. Raw materials for inkjet inks include pigment dispersions, solvents and other additives.
 Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce specialty carbons primarily in China, the Netherlands and the U.S. We also own, or have a controlling interest in, manufacturing plants that produce fumed metal oxides in China, Germany, the United Kingdom (“U.K”), and the U.S. and a manufacturing plant that produces aerogel in Frankfurt, Germany. An equity affiliate operates a fumed metal oxides plant in India. Our specialty compounds are predominately produced in facilities that we own, or have a controlling interest in, located in Belgium, Canada, China and the United Arab Emirates. Our inkjet colorants and inks are manufactured at our facility in the U.S.
 The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2021 in these segment operations in which we own less than 100%:
 
 
Location | Percentage Interest 
-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, three of our reinforcing carbons/specialty carbons manufacturing sites have energy centers.
 We are investing for growth with a number of capacity expansion projects and other transactions. In September 2018, we acquired NSCC Carbon (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd. from Nippon Steel Carbon Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Nippon Steel Chemical & Material Co., Ltd., adding to our portfolio a 50,000-metric ton facility in Pizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. We have begun modifying this facility to produce specialty carbons, and expect production to begin in fiscal 2022. In addition, during fiscal 2018, we purchased Tech Blend, a leading North American producer of black masterbatches, extending our geographic footprint in black masterbatch and compounds. The acquisition added a manufacturing facility in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Québec, Canada to our manufacturing network. In June 2019, we acquired certain intangible assets from a leading masterbatch producer in Asia, which extended our global footprint in black masterbatch. In addition, to meet anticipated demand, we are in the process of expanding our specialty compounds manufacturing capacity with a new specialty compounds unit at our reinforcing carbons plant in Cilegon, Indonesia, which we expect to be completed in 2023.
 We also continue to expand our fumed silica manufacturing capacity, with new plants in Wuhai, China and Carrollton, Kentucky, U.S. In fiscal 2019, we completed construction and began operations at our facility in Wuhai, and in August 2020 we completed construction and began operations at our facility in Carrollton, which is adjacent to DowDuPont’s existing silicone monomer plant.
 To strengthen our formulations capabilities for batteries, in April 2020, we acquired carbon nano-tube producer Shenzhen Sanshun Nano New Materials Co., Ltd. In addition to additional technology capabilities, this acquisition added a manufacturing facility in Zhuhai, China to our manufacturing network. We intend to further expand our manufacturing capacity for our Battery Materials product line to meet anticipated demand, and in November 2021, we entered into an agreement with Tokai Carbon Group to purchase its carbon black manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China, which we expect to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We plan to convert certain manufacturing units to allow us to produce specialty carbons, including products for our Battery Materials product line, and expect the conversion of the first unit at the site to be completed in calendar year 2024. We plan to manufacture reinforcing carbons at this facility initially and during the period of conversion.
 Purification Solutions
 Products
 Activated carbon is a porous material consisting mainly of elemental carbon treated with heat, steam and/or chemicals to create high internal porosity, resulting in a large internal surface area that resembles a sponge. It is generally produced in two forms, powdered and granular, and is manufactured in different sizes, shapes and levels of purity and using a variety of raw materials for a wide variety of applications. Activated carbon is used to remove contaminants from liquids and gases using a process called adsorption, whereby the interconnected pores of activated carbon trap contaminants.
 8

Our activated carbon products are used for the purification of water, air, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and other liquids and gases, as either a colorant or a decolorizing agent in the manufacture of products for food and beverage applications and as a chemical carrier in slow release applications. In gas and air applications, one of the uses of activated carbon is for the removal of mercury in flue gas streams. In certain applications, used activated carbon can be reactivated for further use by removing the contaminants from the pores of the activated carbon product. The most common applications for our reactivated carbon are water treatment and food and beverage purification. In addition to our activated carbon production and reactivation, we also provide activated carbon solutions through on-site equipment and services, including delivery systems for activated carbon injection in coal-fired utilities, mobile water filter units and carbon reactivation services.
 Drivers of Demand and Sales and Customers
 Demand for our activated carbon products is driven primarily by the demand for activated carbon-based solutions for water, gas and air, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, catalysts and other chemical applications.
 Sales of activated carbon are made by Cabot employees and through distributors and sales representatives to a broad range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, food and beverage processors, water treatment plants, pharmaceutical companies and catalyst producers. Some of our sales of activated carbon are made under annual contracts or longer-term agreements, particularly in mercury removal applications.
 Competition
 We are one of the leading manufacturers of activated carbon in the world. We compete in the manufacture of activated carbon with a number of companies, some of which have a global presence and others that have a regional or local presence, although not all of these companies manufacture activated carbon for the range of applications for which we sell our products. Competition for activated carbon and activated carbon equipment and services is based on quality, price, performance, and supply-chain stability. We believe our commercial strengths include our product and application diversity, product differentiation, technological leadership, and quality.
Raw Materials
 The principal raw materials we use in the manufacture of activated carbon are various forms of coal, including lignite, wood and other carbonaceous materials, which are, in general, readily available and we believe we have in adequate supply. With respect to our operations in North America, we owned a lignite mine that was operated by Caddo Creek Resources Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company, and which supplied our Marshall, Texas facility (the “Marshall Facility”). On September 30, 2020, we sold our interest in the mine to ADA Carbon Solutions (Operations) LLC, a subsidiary of Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. (“ADES”), and entered into a long-term supply agreement with ADA Carbon Solutions (Red River), LLC, a subsidiary of ADES, under which it will manufacture and supply our proprietary portfolio of lignite-based activated carbon products exclusively to us. As a result of these actions, effective September 30, 2020, we ceased manufacturing lignite-based activated carbon at our Marshall Facility and idled our activation kilns at that facility.
 Operations
 We own, or have a controlling interest in, and operate plants that produce activated carbon in Italy, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. Since September 30, 2020, operations at our Marshall Facility have been limited to certain operational activities not involving the production of activated carbon, including washing of activated carbon, as well as packaging and warehousing operations. We also have joint venture interests in activated carbon plants in Canada and Mexico, and a reactivation plant in Singapore. The following table shows our ownership interest as of September 30, 2021 in activated carbon operations in which we own less than 100%:

Location | Percentage Interest 
---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------
Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada | 50% (contractual joint venture) 
Atitalaquia, Hidalgo, Mexico Republic of Singapore | 49% (equity affiliate) 35% (equity affiliate)

Patents and Trademarks
 We own and are a licensee of various patents, which expire at different times, covering many of our products as well as processes and product uses. Although the products made and sold under these patents and licenses are important to Cabot, the loss of any particular patent or license would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole. We sell our products under a variety of trademarks we own and take reasonable measures to protect them. While our trademarks are important to Cabot, the loss of any one of our trademarks would not materially affect our business, taken as a whole.

Research and Development
 Our reinforcing and specialty carbon products are highly versatile and meet specific performance requirements across many industries, creating opportunities for innovation. In each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, we spent approximately $55 million on technology development and R&D focused in the areas of conductive carbons, dispersions and engineered elastomer composites. Our process technology innovation efforts have been focused largely on process yield and optimization to reduce our Scope 1 emissions. Going forward, as part of our sustainability efforts, we expect to focus our R&D and innovation on opportunities to further enhance waste heat recovery, integrate reclaimed carbon, recycled polymers and alternative feedstocks into our products, explore the viability and cost effectiveness of the use of carbon capture and storage/use, as well as developing products that enable customers to create products with improved sustainability profiles.
Seasonality
 Our businesses are generally not seasonal in nature, although we may experience some regional seasonal declines during holiday periods and some weather-related seasonality in Purification Solutions.
Human Capital Resources
 Our success is realized through the engagement and commitment of our people. We believe that our globally distributed workforce positions us well to serve our broad customer base in the regions and geographies in which they operate. As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 4,500 employees across our operations, with 40% of our employees in the Americas (65% of whom are in the United States), 31% in EMEA, and 29% in Asia Pacific (75% of whom are in China). Of this global employee base, 44% are employed in manufacturing roles. 
 Our Management Executive Committee (“Executive Committee”) is comprised of our CEO and his nine direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our businesses, our financial, legal, safety, health and environment, human resources, research and development, global business services, and digital functions, and our regional operations.
 Our main human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and ensure they feel safe, supported and empowered to do the best work they can do. Accordingly, our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning the Company’s workforce – particularly in the areas of diversity, talent retention and development, total rewards, and employee health and safety. These areas of focus are also represented in our 2025 Sustainability Goals, which include: 
  
• | fostering an environment where employees report high levels of inclusion and support for their professional development;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 •increasing diverse representation in leadership and professional roles; and
 •reducing injuries and frequency of significant process safety events by 50%.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 In support of our goals and commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive environment where all employees can contribute, thrive and grow, we have focused on several areas during fiscal 2021, including:

• | We introduced a global diversity and inclusion training program focused on unconscious bias for our people managers. This program was well-received, with 99% of our people managers (525 people) and another 470 employees participating in this program in fiscal 2021. We expect to continue to provide this training regularly.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We launched and expanded several Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): Women & Allies, Black Employees and Allies United, VETS, and Pride@Cabot. The objectives of these ERGs are to help foster a diverse, inclusive workplace by educating and building awareness across the Company on challenges underrepresented groups often face, how to be more inclusive, supporting career development and recruiting efforts, and leading community outreach efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We facilitated additional educational programs, workshops and discussions on a variety of diversity and inclusion topics for global, regional and local employee groups to engage individuals and teams.

Total Population | | 3,459 | | 77 | % | | 1,032 | | 23 | % | 4,491

 *Management includes both people managers and senior-level individual contributor roles. 
 Talent Retention and Development
 We have numerous initiatives and programs to attract, develop and retain our talent tailored to specific employee populations and geographies, including leadership and executive development programs, technical training, and other skill-based training. In fiscal 2021, we deployed programs specific to professional growth for our process engineers that encompassed the development of technical skills and capability as well as general business acumen. We also introduced a new online career development portal to provide our employees with tools to empower them to drive their own career development with support from their managers. 
 We have well-established performance management and talent development processes in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees. Throughout the year, managers and employees engage in annual objective setting, quarterly reviews of goal progress, performance feedback, career development discussions, and a year-end performance evaluation. In addition, we regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions and operating segments to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations.
 Our biennial employee engagement survey provides an opportunity for the Company to receive feedback from our global workforce and gain insights related to engagement, retention and development. In our 2021 survey, we had very strong participation with an 87% response rate. We remain encouraged by the results of this survey, which show an increase in overall engagement and intent to stay at Cabot. 
 Some of our employees in the U.S. and abroad are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. We have generally positive and productive employee relations with our employees, unions and works councils globally. 
 Total Rewards 
 We strive to provide a total rewards program that enables us to attract, retain and motivate the best talent to support our businesses. Our compensation programs embrace a pay for performance philosophy and are designed to be competitive within the markets in which we compete for talent. Our pay practices reward individual and Company performance and are equitably differentiated based on role, experience, contributions, and performance. We regularly assess these practices to ensure we are aligning roles with compensation levels based on job responsibilities, market competitiveness, geographical location, strategic importance of roles and other relevant factors.
 Cabot is committed to ensuring that employees are paid fairly relative to one another, without discrimination on the basis of gender or race while taking into account job-related factors such as responsibilities, location, work experience, education and contributions. We conduct reviews annually to monitor our pay practices and develop pay actions where appropriate. Our most recent analysis (which did not include some of our employees who are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements) indicated that we have strong pay parity between females and males globally as well as with People of Color in the United States across all pay components (annual base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives) for those in the same job and location and after assessing job-related factors such as experience, education and performance, with pay adjustments being needed for 1% of the employees who were included in the assessment.
 We also aim to provide competitive benefits programs in all the locations where we operate, including meeting or exceeding local regulations and focusing on health and welfare, employee well-being, and retirement savings. Consistent with this practice, during the COVID-19 pandemic we enhanced many of our offerings and provided the benefits described below, a number of which we continue to provide in order to better support our employees and their families:

• | Expanding our Employee Assistance Program globally and offering seminars to assist employees with mental well-being
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employee Health & Safety 
 We are committed to providing a workplace that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees. As part of our Drive to Zero initiative, we have set a long-term goal of achieving zero injuries at our facilities worldwide. We intend to achieve this ambitious objective by training employees in hazard recognition, ensuring procedures are established to mitigate risks and equipping supervisory personnel with the tools and skills required to execute our work safely. As part of this effort, members of our leadership team participate in root cause determinations and the results are shared throughout our network of operating facilities. Recognizing that it may take many years to achieve our Drive to Zero, we have established a continuous improvement goal for personal safety to achieve a 50% reduction in our recordable and severe injury rate from our baseline measurement in 2019 by 2025. For fiscal year 2021, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) based upon the number of injuries per 200,000 work hours for both employees and contractors was 0.34 and our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was 0.24. For comparison, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports for chemical manufacturing an average TRIR of 1.8 and LTIR 1.2 in calendar year 2020. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also implemented additional health and safety protocols at our sites to reduce employee density, enhance cleaning and enact distancing requirements. Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) was provided to employees, and work procedures were modified to reduce risk. We continue to refine these measures as new information about the virus becomes available.
 Through our global SH&E Policy, which is endorsed by our Executive Committee, we hold ourselves accountable to demonstrate our company values and continuously improve the way we operate. The policy defines several important objectives for our continuous improvement in safety, including:
  
• | Complying with all applicable regulations
--+------------------------------------------


• | Sharing complete information about the safe handling of our products
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining the safety and security of our employees, contractors and neighbors

Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability
 In recognition of the importance of safety, health, environment and sustainability matters to Cabot, our Board of Directors has a Safety, Health, Environment, and Sustainability Committee. The Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, meets regularly and oversees our safety, health, and environmental performance, process safety, security, product stewardship, community engagement and governmental affairs. In particular, the Committee reviews metrics, audit results, emerging trends, overall performance, risks and opportunity assessments and management processes related to our safety, health, environmental and sustainability program. 
 Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, rules, and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters (“SH&E Requirements”). The SH&E Requirements to which our operations are subject include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities and for product registrations. We have expended and will continue to expend considerable resources to construct, maintain, operate, and improve our facilities throughout the world for safety, health and environmental protection and to comply with SH&E Requirements. We spent $83 million in environmental-related capital expenditures in fiscal 2021. We anticipate spending approximately $80 million for such matters in fiscal 2022, a significant portion of which will continue to be for the installation of air pollution control equipment and wastewater infrastructure improvements at certain of our plants. These costs include costs associated with our compliance with the Consent Decree we entered into in November 2013 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (“LDEQ”) regarding Cabot’s three carbon black manufacturing facilities in the U.S. This settlement is related to the EPA’s national enforcement initiative focused on the U.S. carbon black manufacturing sector alleging non-compliance with certain regulatory and permitting requirements under The 
 12

Clean Air Act, including the New Source Review (“NSR”) construction permitting requirements. Pursuant to this settlement, Cabot has installed technology controls for sulfur dioxide and/or nitrogen oxide at its carbon black plants in Pampa, Texas and Canal, Louisiana, and is in the process of installing such technology controls at its plant in Ville Platte, Louisiana. We expect that the total capital costs to install these technology controls will be in the range of $225 million to $250 million and will be incurred through calendar year 2023. As of September 30, 2021, we have incurred $125 million to install these controls in the U.S. We also expect our operating costs will increase as these controls become operational. All carbon black manufacturers in the U.S. have settled with the EPA and are installing similar controls.
 Environmental agencies worldwide are increasingly implementing regulations and other requirements resulting in more restrictive air emission limits globally, particularly as they relate to nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter emissions. In addition, growing concerns about climate change and an increased focus on carbon neutrality have led to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will impact the carbon black and activated carbon industries and our businesses as carbon dioxide is emitted from those manufacturing processes. Currently, in Europe, our four carbon black facilities and one activated carbon facility are subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (“EU ETS”). The fourth phase of the EU ETS began in January 2021 with updated product benchmarks for our carbon black facilities. In addition, our carbon black facility in The Netherlands is subject to The Netherlands CO2 tax, which is a top-off tax to the EU ETS scheme, and in 2021 was assessed a CO2 tax. We do not expect to be assessed a supplemental Netherlands CO2 tax as EUA pricing is expected to remain higher than the Netherlands CO2 tax threshold in the next few years. In China national emissions trading program is currently only in place for the power sector and has not yet been expanded beyond that sector. We continue to monitor that program’s further implementation and expect it to apply to the carbon black industry in 2023 or 2024, with the existing pilots expected to continue to operate until the national program becomes effective. In Canada, our carbon black manufacturing facility has been subject to the Canadian federal carbon tax program. The new Ontario Emissions Performance Standard trading system will replace the Canadian federal Output-Based Pricing System for our carbon black facility in Ontario, with specific transition requirements that were announced in October 2021 becoming effective on January 1, 2022. In addition, under the Province of Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks regulations, we expect we will be required within the next three to five years to install technology controls for sulfur dioxide at our manufacturing plant in Sarnia, Ontario. In Mexico, our carbon black facility is participating in the pilot national ETS program, which is expected to continue into fiscal 2022. A carbon tax has also recently been adopted in the Tamaulipas state, where our operations in Mexico are located, that became effective on January 1, 2021. In other regions where we operate, some of our facilities are required to report their greenhouse gas emissions but are not currently subject to programs requiring trading or emission controls but may be subject to limited carbon tax programs affecting fuels we purchase. We generally expect to pay any incurred taxes or purchase emission credits as needed to respond to any allocation shortfalls and pass these costs on to our customers. In addition, further air emission regulations may be adopted in the future in regions and countries where we operate, which could have an impact on our operations. Increasing regulatory programs associated with emissions and concerns regarding climate change are expected to increase our capital and operational costs in the future.
 Cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (the “Superfund law”) and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites primarily associated with our divested businesses. (See “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 below, and Note U in Item 8 below, under the heading “Contingencies”.) During the next several years, as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out, we expect to spend against our environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation. As of September 30, 2021, our environmental reserve was approximately $5 million. Adjustments are made to the reserve based on our continuing analysis of our share of costs likely to be incurred at each site. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates due to unknown conditions at the various sites, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and changing technologies for handling site investigation and remediation. While the reserve represents our best estimate of the costs we expect to incur, the actual costs to investigate and remediate these sites may exceed the amounts accrued in the environmental reserve. While it is always possible that an unusual event may occur with respect to a given site and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period, we do not believe that the costs relating to these sites, in the aggregate, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Furthermore, it is possible that we may also incur future costs relating to environmental liabilities not currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate.
 The International Agency for Research on Cancer (“IARC”) classifies carbon black as a Group 2B substance (known animal carcinogen, possible human carcinogen). We have communicated IARC’s classification of carbon black to our customers and employees and have included that information in our safety data sheets and elsewhere, as appropriate. We continue to believe that the available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that carbon black is not carcinogenic to humans, and does not present a health hazard when handled in accordance with good housekeeping and safe workplace practices as described in our safety data sheets.
 Our products are subject to the chemical control laws and regulatory requirements of the countries in which they are manufactured or imported. These laws include the regulation of chemical substances and inventories under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) in the U.S. and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACh”) in the European Union. 
 13

Manufacturers or importers of these chemical substances are required to submit specified health, safety, environment, risk and use information about these substances. Under the “Evaluation” portion of the REACh framework, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and European Union Member States assess the information submitted by companies within registration dossiers and testing proposals to determine whether the associated substances are safe for use. The dossier of silica and multiwalled carbon nanotubes have recently been reviewed and accepted by the competent authority. Carbon black is scheduled for review in 2022. Analogous regimes exist in other parts of the world, including the UK, Turkey, Eurasia, China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Many of these chemical control regulations are in the process of a multi-year implementation period for product/substance registrations or notifications.
 Additional requirements for nanomaterials apply to many of our existing products including carbon black, fumed silica, inkjet pigments, fumed alumina, and advanced carbons such as carbon nanostructures and carbon nanotubes. Country-specific nanomaterial reporting programs have been implemented in some countries and are being developed by others. We intend to continue to monitor and comply with these requirements. 
 A number of organizations and regulatory agencies have become increasingly focused on the issue of water scarcity and water quality, particularly in certain geographic regions. We are engaged in various activities to promote water conservation and wastewater recycling. The costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 Various U.S. agencies and international bodies have adopted security requirements applicable to certain manufacturing and industrial facilities and marine port locations. These security-related requirements involve the preparation of security assessments and security plans in some cases, and in other cases the registration of certain facilities with specified governmental authorities. We closely monitor all security-related regulatory developments and believe we are in compliance with all existing requirements. Compliance with such requirements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
