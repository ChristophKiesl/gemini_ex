Background

CynergisTek, Inc. was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 29, 1995, under the name Corporate Development Centers, Inc. On April 1, 2004, we acquired Alan Mayo and Associates, Inc. dba The Mayo Group (“TMG”), a managed print company.  TMG provided outsourced print management services to healthcare facilities throughout California.  After we acquired TMG, we changed our name to “Auxilio, Inc.” and changed the name of TMG’s former subsidiary to “Auxilio Solutions, Inc.,” and later changed its name again to “CTEK Solutions, Inc.” Effective July 1, 2014, we acquired Delphiis, Inc., a California corporation, which provided IT security consulting services.  On April 7, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Redspin, Inc. which provides IT security consulting services. On January 13, 2017, we acquired CynergisTek, Inc., a Texas corporation, which had the vision to help healthcare organizations assess risk and comply with regulatory measures and was one of the first organizations to follow the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a standard now recognized by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) 7898 amendment. The company was reincorporated in Delaware in September 2017 and assumed its current name CynergisTek, Inc. and up listed to the NYSE.  The Company expanded into providing additional IT security consulting services and solutions. On October 31, 2019, we acquired Backbone Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“Backbone”), which provides similar services including IT audits.

Our Common Stock currently trades on the NYSE American under the symbol “CTEK.”

Principal Products and Services

We are engaged in the business of helping U.S. based companies in highly regulated industries, including healthcare, be prepared to handle unforeseen cyber threats, comply with regulations, and gain the confidence that their efforts are strengthening their security posture and building resilience. This is achieved through our cybersecurity, privacy, compliance and audit services. 

CynergisTek was born in healthcare and is one of the few consulting and advisory companies focused on converging security and privacy with a methodology to validate the rigor and effectiveness of the programs as a managed service. We believe that our years of experience of understanding our clients’ unique challenges allows us to provide our customers with services designed around industry best practices to improve security controls, policies and procedures and to protect sensitive information. Our team of subject matter experts and consultants are comprised of knowledgeable professionals who have learned their craft both in the classroom and through years of practical on-the-job experience, including as policy makers, attorneys and leaders in cybersecurity, privacy and compliance. 

Our services are categorized into four service groups, which are: assess, build, manage, and validate. These services are designed to meet the client where they are in their security journey as recurring managed services under long-term contracts structured to provide a sustainable and growing program, or under shorter duration consulting or professional services engagements.

· | Assess - identify, measure, and test security and privacy risk of an organization’s readiness and verify and validate their programs meet compliance and business objectives through IT audits, technical testing, and risk and program assessments. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Build - develop policies and procedures and playbooks to help build out a fully comprehensive risk management program and provide resources to help organizations prioritize, implement and execute initiatives to strengthen their security and privacy programs. 
· | Manage - provide on-going management and oversight of specific components of an organization’s security and privacy programs to address or give alerts when an issue arises and to offer our expertise that they need to accelerate the effectiveness of their programs.
· | Validate - verify the processes, people, and technology are working effectively and provide insight to the ROI of an organization’s security investment through advanced services requiring highly experienced resources and/or technology to deliver.

For sophisticated organizations our Resilience Partner Program encompasses a bundle of services from the assess, build, manage, and validate categories to deliver clarity and guidance as a consistent partner helping maintain and grow their security infrastructure through more rigorous proactive testing, evaluation and validation services.

Competition

The competition in the healthcare industry market for cybersecurity, privacy and compliance services generally comes from large or niche consulting and technology firms and regional companies that offer multiple approaches but within a much smaller geographic footprint. Examples include companies like Deloitte, Dell Secureworks, Coalfire, Fortified Health Security, Meditology, Impact Advisors, First Health Advisory and Clearwater Consulting. 

We believe our analysis of the competitive landscape shows a very strong opportunity to provide the healthcare and adjacent industries with services to support the demand for security and privacy assessments, program development, offensive security testing and managed services, and we believe that we have a strong competitive position in the marketplace due to several important factors:


· | We are not aware of many other vendors or service providers which have the majority of their business dedicated to addressing the healthcare industry. Our expertise and the depth of our client relationships are unmatched in the market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We believe our offering provides a unique approach to address workforce and expertise shortages. We are able to deploy knowledgeable resources to perform a predefined security role on-site or virtually for a defined amount of time, which results in our customers receiving staff with expertise they need while controlling their costs. 
· | We are not restricted to any single supplier, which allows us to bring the best hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our approach is to use the most appropriate technology to provide a superior solution without any prejudice as to manufacturer or developer. 
· | We believe our relationship with healthcare providers gives us an advantage when targeting the larger pool of potential clients in the business associate category, including leading Electronic Health Record (EHR) providers and medical device manufacturers who have recently been added as clients. 
· | We believe that combining both our traditional and more proactive approaches to data protection make us a more versatile solution for entities regardless of program maturity. 
· | We have a strong referral base within healthcare as a result of serving more than a thousand hospitals and other healthcare clients under managed services agreements for twenty plus years. 
· | Our employees have broad experience in and outside of healthcare to bring a wide range of knowledge and best practices. At the present time, we have employees who formerly worked for the Office of Civil Rights, were Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Information Officers and Chief Compliance Officers at some of the leading healthcare institutions. In addition, our subject matter experts and consultants maintain multiple industry certifications including CISSP, CISM, CGEIT, CRISC, CISA, CBCP, CCIE, CCNP, CCNA, CHPC, CHRC, CHC, CIPP, CHPS, MCSE, SCSA, SCNA, CIA, ISSMP, CMMC Provisional Assessor, CMMC Registered Provider and ISSAP.

Customers

Most of our customers are considered part of the healthcare industry and third parties who provide services to the healthcare industry. Recently we have increased our efforts to expand outside of healthcare into other highly regulated industries and now have customers that operate in a variety of industries, including education, financial services, government, internet and media, and manufacturing. The loss of any key customer could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business, prospects and results of operation. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest customer represented approximately 13% of our revenues.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also license software from third parties for integration into our procedures, including open-source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.

We control access to and use of our proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our intellectual property is protected by U.S. and international trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without our permission.

We maintain databases that contain the results of our assessment efforts. This allows us to anticipate our customers’ future needs by developing or offering existing services to meet those needs. These databases provide us with exclusive insight into the state of cybersecurity of our customers and the healthcare industry. We consider our intellectual property an important and valuable asset that enhances our competitive position.

We have trademark registrations in the United States for “CYNERGISTEK,” “REDSPIN,” “MANAGED SECURITY VALIDATION” and the CynergisTek logo.

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had 89 full-time employees, including 66 employees engaged in providing services, 10 employees engaged in sales and marketing, and 13 employees engaged in general and administrative activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We are proud of our diversity efforts that include above industry averages in several minority categories and a high representation of veteran employees. We believe our employee relations are good.

CynergisTek complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which we operate. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.

We value ongoing training to keep our employees’ skills current by providing them with an annual training budget, education assistance and a team with diverse skills for easy and collaborative cross-training opportunities. In addition to training from anyone on the team in areas of interest, employees are also empowered to train others.

CynergisTek is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, re-designed workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our customers to safely manage our operations.

Governmental Regulation

We are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. These consumer protection laws and regulations could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.

Legislation in the United States has increased public companies’ regulatory and compliance costs as well as the scope and cost of work provided by independent registered public accountants and legal advisors. As regulatory and compliance guidelines continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs in the future, which may or may not be material, in order to comply with legislative requirements or rules, pronouncements and guidelines by regulatory bodies.
