ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
Knoll, Inc. (“Knoll,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) is a leading global manufacturer of commercial and residential furniture, accessories, lighting and coverings, including textiles, felt and leather. Our constellation of design-driven brands coupled with our perspectives on space planning allow our clients to create inspired modern interiors. Simply stated, we provide the furnishings to bring the beauty and benefits of modern design to the way we live and work. Our businesses represent a diversified portfolio that responds to evolving trends and performs throughout business cycles, sharing reputations for high-quality and sophistication. To the architects and designers we work with, to our clients in the commercial, education, healthcare and government sectors, and to the many consumers we reach, Knoll represents a commitment to innovative solutions and an unmatched heritage of modern design. 
How people live and work is constantly being reshaped by changing technology and lifestyle trends. Our founders, Hans and Florence Knoll, believed in the power of design to enhance people’s lives. Since our founding over 80 years ago, Knoll has won a place in iconic settings and in museums worldwide, earning numerous design honors and awards. Today, we have an unsurpassed collection of classic products to introduce, and reintroduce, as well as groundbreaking new designs. We leverage strong relationships with contemporary furniture and industrial designers, and a reputation that attracts talented new designers. 
We focus on two distinct “to-the-trade” specifier markets, workplace and residential. Workplace, the largest portion of our business, is where we see strategic opportunities through the expansion of underpenetrated categories and ancillary markets. At the same time, in the residential market, we are expanding further into consumer and decorator channels worldwide leveraging our experience with products that cross-over between the office and the home. We reach customers primarily through a broad network of independent dealers and distribution partners, our direct sales force, our showrooms, home design shops and our online presence.
We manage our business through our reportable segments: Office and Lifestyle. All unallocated costs are included within Corporate. 
The Office segment addresses diverse workplace planning paradigms in domestic and international markets, creating high-quality performing spaces with open plan and private furniture, architectural elements, collaborative and ergonomic seating and modular storage. Product categories include: office systems furniture, seating, storage, tables, desks and KnollExtra® accessories. The Office segment includes DatesWeiser®, known for signature spaces with refined and flexible conference furniture platforms that set a standard of design, quality and technology integration, as well as Fully®, which offers standing desks, high-performance adjustable height desks, ergonomic chairs and accessories principally for individual home offices and small businesses.
The Lifestyle segment includes KnollStudio®, HOLLY HUNT®, KnollTextiles®, Spinneybeck® | Filzfelt®,Edelman® Leather and Muuto®. KnollStudio products, which are distributed in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, include iconic seating, lounge furniture, side, café and dining chairs as well as conference, training, dining and occasional tables, lighting, rugs, textiles, high-quality fabrics, felt, leather and related architectural products. The Lifestyle segment products represent an important part of our workplace business.
The Corporate function represents the accumulation of unallocated costs relating to shared services and general corporate activities including, but not limited to, legal expenses, acquisition expenses, certain finance, human resources, administrative and executive expenses and other expenses that are not directly attributable to an operating segment. Dedicated, direct selling, general and administrative expenses of the segments are included within segment operating profit. As we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, the central support of the Corporate function will evolve and grow as well.
For further information regarding our segments see the section below and Note 21 in the accompanying financial statements.
Strategy
We draw on our constellation of businesses and brands to provide products and designs that meet the needs of our customers. Our offerings range from our classic signature pieces to our ancillary products which include the Rockwell Unscripted® collection by The Rockwell Group, the vast product portfolio of Muuto and the products of our most recent acquisition of Fully; from dramatic textiles, to Filzfelt architectural products for acoustical control. We solve a variety of needs for each customer, and our goal for each engagement is to maximize the opportunity from the start. To that end, we deploy strategic programs to better synchronize our office and lifestyle teams and resources to deliver a single compelling customer experience. We also continue to invest in technology for our dealer partners to make it easier to do business with Knoll. 
Our growth strategy also focuses on specific international markets where we can significantly build our share, such as Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and selected under-penetrated areas across the globe where there is a concentration of discerning clients.
Office Segment
Maximizing the sales growth and profitability of Office, our largest segment, has been a continuing priority. With respect to growth in our Office segment, a variety of initiatives will contribute to making this growth possible: broadening our Workplace products portfolio; enhancing sales coverage strategically, including a focus on global accounts; and capturing a greater share of our dealer's ancillary sales. At the same time, we aim to increase profitability through operational improvements and investments in our infrastructure. The acquisition of Fully in August 2019 provides the Office segment with a high-quality, cost-effective complement to our portfolio of office solutions, while also broadening our consumer market through an e-commerce platform. Our lean manufacturing initiative, combined with continued modernization of our facilities, is allowing us to progressively deliver on this goal.
The commercial market has shifted dramatically in the last decade. As clients are readdressing the relationship between individual and collaborative, shared spaces, they are reducing the footprint of individual workstations and investing in more ancillary furniture. Knoll is committed to maintaining our leadership in open floor-plan workspaces and private offices, while inventing and innovating new ways for people to work. Our constellation of businesses positions us well to deliver in the evolving work environment, where people choose how and where they work throughout the day, as the traditional boundaries between residential and workplace products blur, and the importance of a total environment outshines any one particular element. 
We are looking beyond traditional office product categories - systems, task seating and storage - to furniture for shared spaces and the in-between spaces where people meet. We believe that our success in our traditional office products gives us an advantage throughout the workplace. As we design new products suited to these more flexible spaces, we are also responding to demands at different price points with different materials and finishes. Our Rockwell Unscripted™ collection, including Creative Wall®, continued to receive enthusiastic recognition at the 2019 Knoll Design Days trade show for addressing the idea of a hospitality work experience. Rockwell Unscripted brings a sense of theater and play to the workplace, putting people at the center of the work life experience and creating a warm and welcoming place where people want to be. Rockwell Unscripted Creative Wall has been successful in allowing clients to delineate space in the open environment, creating spaces for teams or individuals to focus and work. Our breath of height-adjustable tables, including k.TM Stand, k.TM bench, Tone® and Antenna® Telescope® continue to receive national industry recognition for its straightforward and adaptable concept that delivers a clean, compact workstation solution with intuitive adjustments and people centered design. 
With the evolution from individual workstations to collaborative spaces and ancillary products, Knoll is not only expanding the breadth of our offerings through our constellation of brands but also strengthening our presence in the marketplace. We are continuing to partner with our dealers to ensure our customers understand that Knoll provides not just systems or workstations and work chairs but rather a complete family of complementary ancillary products. Together, we are meeting the demands of our customers while capturing more of their total spend and elevating the profitability of our engagements. 
This approach has served as a catalyst for dealers to invest in their spaces. Their showrooms are becoming extensions of our own, offering not just product showcases but places to find new integrated workplace solutions from all of Knoll. Dealers help people to understand workplace needs and planning capabilities, and Knoll is providing more of the training and education that helps them add value and increase their profits when they sell Knoll.
Our principal Knoll Office product lines, described below, include systems furniture, seating, storage, tables, desks and KnollExtra ergonomic accessories. The Office segment comprised approximately 61.2% of our sales in 2019, 60.1% of our sales in 2018, and 63.8% of our sales in 2017.

Knoll systems can adapt to virtually any office environment, from team spaces to private executive offices.

KnollStudio 
Drawing upon Knoll's iconic heritage, KnollStudio elevates residential and commercial environments with inspiring and iconic designs that embody quality and craftsmanship.
For over eighty years, Knoll has worked with celebrated architects and designers from around the world, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Isamu Noguchi, Warren Platner, Frank Gehry, Maya Lin and Richard Schultz, among others. Many of their designs have remained in production since their initial launch, while others have been mined from the archives and re-imagined in recent years for a contemporary audience. 
Today, KnollStudio works with today's most innovative thinkers worldwide to bring exceptional modern design to the home and office, collaborating with groundbreaking contemporary designers and architects including David Adjaye, Edward Barber, Mark Krusin, Piero Lissoni, Marc Newson and Jay Osgerby, to create future classics for residential and commercial markets. Signature KnollStudio designs display elevated detailing, artistry and comfort, across price points, and often draw designers and customers into the larger Knoll constellation of brands. Moving forward, KnollStudio has a multi-year strategy to build its classics portfolio by mining its archive and adding new finishes, as well as to grow its contemporary collections for both home and office with innovative designs by the new voices of today. 
Our principal KnollStudio product lines include seating, storage, lounge furniture, side, café and dining chairs as well as conference, dining, training and occasional tables. While KnollStudio designs represent different viewpoints and eras, they all embrace a Modernist aesthetic. As a result, designers can integrate our ensemble of products into harmonious and inspiring settings furnished entirely with Knoll products. 
With the trend towards residentially-inspired workplaces, KnollStudio products have gained cross-over appeal between residential and workplace. In North America, the workplace ancillary sales team continues to expand in size and reach, with a focus on corporate projects, hotels and restaurants, as well as government and educational institutions. To grow its residential channel, KnollStudio has expanded its audience in recent years through a to-the-trade showroom in New York City's Decoration & Design building, branded flagship Knoll Home Design Shops in New York City and Los Angeles, as well as the knoll.com website, which reach retail consumers and designers alike. Additionally, the company continues to invest in the Knoll Space retail sales program, which brings consumers the best of Knoll furnishings for their home and home office, through approximately 50 specialty retailers and e-tailers throughout the United States and Canada.
In addition to our presence in North America, KnollStudio is represented by showrooms in Paris, London and Milan and through our exclusive network of retailers throughout Europe and Asia. Our presence in the European market pursues the Company’s objective of offering design, innovation, functional excellence and quality, and extending our reach into all markets through an intensive network of selected dealers.
HOLLY HUNT 
Known for a look that is consistently at the forefront of style and quality, our HOLLY HUNT showrooms and collections lead the industry in luxury home furnishings. The company designs, produces and showcases high-quality, custom design pieces for the most exquisite interior spaces and properties around the globe, including indoor and outdoor furniture, lighting, rugs, wall covering, textiles, leathers, art and accessories.  As both a premier provider and distributor of furnishings, HOLLY HUNT continues to expand our reach into the high-end, "to-the-trade" residential marketplace. Our strategy continues to focus on premium product category expansion and optimizing best-in-class client and operational service levels across domestic, international and digital trade channels.  There are fourteen HOLLY HUNT-owned showrooms in the US and London, along with partner showrooms in major markets, and an expanding international presence.
KnollTextiles
Our Lifestyle segment includes KnollTextiles, renowned for enriching spaces with color, pattern and textures. In addition to a direct sales force, KnollTextiles distributes its products through a showroom in New York City's Decoration & Design building, Knoll consumer retail spaces in New York City and Los Angeles and through the knolltextiles.com website. KnollTextiles products appeal to contract, hospitality, education and residential clients and we offer a full range of products in the Modernist tradition from upholstery and drapery to wall coverings and healthcare curtains including some of the industry's most technically advanced materials. Our KT Collection of upholstery marries classic modern design for everyday use, in a range of high-performance patterns and textures. Against the backdrop of the rich and storied work of Florence Knoll, KnollTextiles combines beauty and function, producing fresh perspectives for contemporary interiors.
Spinneybeck | FilzFelt
Our Lifestyle segment includes Spinneybeck | FilzFelt which has expanded from being exclusively a supplier of raw material to a provider of leather, felt, plaster, cork and wood finished products that enhance the architectural and acoustic experience of commercial, education and hospitality settings. The same trends that have been transforming Knoll Office workspaces have created new opportunities for architectural and acoustic products that offer flexible space division and sound control. Spinneybeck and FilzFelt have evolved, respectively, from an upholstery leather company and 100% wool felt provider that meets the demand for new and renewable materials to a comprehensive natural materials resource. This approach provides specifiers and clients with architectural and acoustic solutions that leverage the opportunity for more large-scale orders. Our full Spinneybeck | Filzfelt assortment includes upholstery and wall coverings, modular acoustic wall tiles and panels, ceiling baffles and screens. 
Edelman Leather
Our Lifestyle segment includes Edelman Leather which offers beautiful, natural leathers for the global design community. Edelman is a "to-the-trade" supplier and goes to market by leveraging eight branded showrooms and sales representation around the world. Edelman successfully expanded beyond leather coverings by offering rug furnishings through its distribution partner Ruckstuhl. Edelman is also developing new leather coverings for the hospitality business, offering quality within the financial constraints of today’s hotels and restaurants. 
Muuto
 The acquisition of Muuto in January 2018 added a resimercial, design-driven provider of affordable luxury furniture, lighting and accessories for the workplace and home to our Lifestyle segment. Muuto is rooted in Scandinavian design traditions characterized by enduring aesthetics, functionality, craftsmanship and an honest expression. Muuto products pair seamlessly with the range of modern Knoll designs, offering an expanded breadth and depth of affordable luxury products with forward-looking ideas to reflect today's work and lifestyles, and particular appeal to a younger generation of architects, designers and clients seeking a homier, more relaxed aesthetic. 
Muuto's principal furniture product lines include: 
•Outline Series 
•Nerd Series 
•The Dots Series 
•Fiber Chairs
•Visu Chairs 
The Lifestyle segment represented approximately 38.8% of our sales in 2019, 39.9% of our sales in 2018, and 36.2% of our sales in 2017. 
Product Design and Development 
Our design philosophy and modern perspective reflects a historical commitment to partnering with preeminent industrial designers and architects to commercialize products that meet evolving workplace and residential needs. By combining designers' creative vision with our commitment to innovative materials and technologically advanced processes, we continue to cultivate brand loyalty among target clients. Our enviable history of nurturing the design process fosters strong, lasting relationships that attract the world's leading designers. In addition, these collaborations are consistent with our commitment to a lean organization and incentive-based compensation, by utilizing a variable royalty-based fee as opposed to the fixed costs typically associated with a larger in-house design staff. 
Our broad range of workplace research, which explores the connection between workspace design and human behavior, health and performance, and the quality of the user experience, drives our workplace product development initiatives. Recent research initiatives include a study of acoustics in the workplace as well as a new way to think about space, referred to as Immersive Planning, and contributed to the development of Rockwell Unscripted.
In addition, our Office and Lifestyle segments product development relies upon a New Product Commercialization Process to ensure quality and consistency of our methodology, reducing product development cycle time without sacrificing quality objectives. We use Pro/ENGINEER® solids modeling tools and rapid prototyping technology to compress development cycles and to improve responsiveness to special requests for customized solutions. Working closely with the designers during the early phases of development provides critical focus to yield the most viable products, balancing innovative modern design with practical function. Cross-functional teams are employed for all major development efforts with dedicated leaders who facilitate a seamless flow into manufacturing while aggressively managing cost and schedule opportunities. Increasingly, total environmental impact is factored into product material and manufacturing process decisions. 
Sales and Distribution 
We generate workplace sales with our direct sales force and through a network of independent dealers, who jointly market and sell our products. We generally rely on these independent dealers to also provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our clients. Our dealers generally operate under short-term (one to three year), non-exclusive agreements. Our residential sales products are sold by our own internal sales force through a network of showrooms, as well as through a network of independent retailers. 
Our workplace clients are typically Fortune 1000 companies, governmental agencies and other medium-to-large sized organizations in a variety of industries including financial, legal, technology, entertainment, accounting, education, government, healthcare and hospitality. Our direct sales force and independent dealers in North America work in close partnership with clients and design professionals to specify distinctive work environments. Our direct sales representatives, in conjunction with the independent dealers, sell to and call directly on key clients. Our independent dealers also call on many other medium and small sized clients to provide seamless sales support and client service.
We have aligned our sales force to target strategic areas of opportunity to include global accounts, healthcare, higher education and others. We have also placed sales representatives and technical specialists into certain dealerships to support programs such as Knoll Essentials, which is described below. We expanded our sales force to cover a more dispersed market which has shifted to include increased small to mid-size projects and fewer large projects. Additionally, we have provided specification tools to our dealers and sellers that enable them to share with our clients real time visual simulations and renderings from our complete product offerings.
In addition to coordinating sales efforts with the sales representatives, our dealers generally handle project management, installation and maintenance for client accounts after the initial product selection and sale. Although many of these dealerships also carry products of other manufacturers, they have agreed not to act as dealers for our principal direct competitors. We have not experienced significant dealer turnover. Our dealers' substantial commitment to understanding our product lines, and their strong relationships with us, serve to discourage dealers from changing vendor affiliations. We are not significantly dependent on any one dealer, the largest of which accounted for approximately 6.5%, 4.8%, and 4.6%, of our North American sales in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 
As part of our commitment to building relationships with our dealers, we offer the Knoll Essentials program. Knoll Essentials is a catalog program developed in response to dealer requests for a consolidated, user-friendly selling tool for day-to-day systems, seating, storage, and accessory products. The Knoll Essentials program includes dealer incentives to sell our products. We also employ a dedicated team of dealer sales representatives to work with our dealerships. 
Sales to U.S. and state and local government agencies, respectively, aggregated approximately 4.5% and 7.1%, respectively, of our consolidated sales in 2019. The U.S. government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. 
Our residential sales are sold through a global network of showrooms, e-commerce, retail stores and independent dealers. Our clients range from “to the trade” professionals, such as interior designers, to individual consumers.
Our products and knowledgeable sales force have generated strong brand recognition and loyalty among architects, designers and corporate facility managers, all of whom are key decision-makers in the furniture purchasing process. Our strong relationships with architects and design professionals help us stay abreast of key workplace and residential furniture trends and position us to better meet the changing needs of clients.
Manufacturing and Operations 
Our global supply chain manufactures and assembles products to specific customer orders and operates all facilities under a philosophy of continuous improvement and lean manufacturing. Our Office segment is supported by operational and administrative facilities in Canada, Italy, Michigan, Oregon and Pennsylvania. The Lifestyle Segment is supported by sites in Connecticut, Illinois, Italy, New York, Pennsylvania, Denmark and Texas. In addition, we utilize many third parties to produce a variety of our Office and Lifestyle designs.
We continue to look for ways to ensure that our manufacturing capabilities match our supply chain strategy providing the most value for Knoll. The root of our continuous improvement efforts lies in the philosophy of lean manufacturing that drives operations. As part of this philosophy, we partner with suppliers who can facilitate efficient and often just-in-time deliveries, allowing us to manage our raw materials inventory. We also utilize “Kaizen” work groups in the plants to develop best practices to minimize scrap, time and material waste at all stages of the manufacturing process. The involvement of employees at all levels ensures an organizational commitment to lean and efficient manufacturing operations. These projects improved customer responsiveness, quality and significantly improve productivity.
In January 2020, we announced that we will consolidate our manufacturing footprint in North America, resulting in the closure of our Grand Rapids, Michigan manufacturing facility. We have elected to undergo this restructuring in order to reduce our structural costs and better optimize our North American manufacturing footprint and supply chain. See Note 22, Subsequent Events, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Raw Materials and Suppliers 
In addition to the continued focus on enhancing the efficiency of the manufacturing operations, we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort. We have capitalized on raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost global suppliers. This broader view of potential sources of supply has enhanced our leverage with domestic supply sources, and we have been able to reduce cycle times by extracting improvements from all levels throughout the supply chain. 
The purchasing function in North America is centralized at the East Greenville facility for Office, KnollStudio North America, and Textiles. This centralization, and the close relationships with our primary suppliers, has enhanced our ability to realize purchasing economies of scale and implement “just-in-time” inventory practices. Steel, lumber, paper, paint, plastics, laminates, particleboard, veneers, glass, fabrics, leathers, upholstery filling material, aluminum extrusions and castings are used in our manufacturing process. The purchasing function for KnollStudio Europe is based in Italy, Muuto is based in Denmark, Holly Hunt is based in Illinois, Edelman is based in Connecticut, Spinneybeck and DatesWeiser are based in New York. Both domestic and overseas suppliers of these materials are selected based upon a variety of factors, with the price and quality of the materials and the supplier's ability to meet delivery requirements being primary factors in such selection. We do not generally enter into long-term supply contracts and, as a result, we can be vulnerable to fluctuations in the prices for these materials. No supplier is the only available source for a particular component or raw material. However, because of the specialization involved with some of our components, it can take a significant amount of time, money and effort to move to an alternate source. 
Backlog 
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the company's backlog of unfilled orders was $249.6 million and $249.7 million, respectively. We expect that substantially all the orders comprising the backlog at December 31, 2019, will be filled during the next fiscal year. Many orders received by the Company are reflected in the backlog for only a short period while other orders specify delayed shipments and are carried in our backlog for up to one year. Accordingly, the amount of the backlog at any particular time does not necessarily indicate the level of net sales for a particular succeeding period.
Competition 
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. We compete on the basis of (i) product design, including performance, ergonomic and aesthetic features; (ii) product quality and durability; (iii) relationships with clients, architects and designers; (iv) strength of dealer and distributor network; (v) on-time delivery and service performance; (vi) commitment to environmental standards by offering products that help clients achieve LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified facilities and minimize environmental impact; and (vii) price. We estimate that our share of the North American workplace market in 2019 and 2018 was 7.8% and 7.5%, respectively. 
Some of our workplace competitors, especially those in North America, are larger and have significantly greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and technical resources than us. Our most significant competitors in primary markets are Herman Miller, Inc., Steelcase, Inc., Haworth, Inc. and, to a lesser extent, Teknion Corporation and Allsteel, Inc., an operating unit of HNI Corporation. These competitors have a substantial volume of furniture installed at businesses throughout North America, providing a continual source of demand for further products and enhancements. Moreover, the products of these competitors have strong acceptance in the marketplace. For Muuto, we also compete against smaller open-line brands that can be sold through our own dealers. Despite our competitors' strength in the marketplace, we believe that we have been able to compete successfully in the markets to date.
Competition in the residential sector is much more fragmented than in the workplace market. Our Lifestyle businesses serve the mid-to high-end of the market, but compete against many companies, none of which has a dominant market share.
Patents and Trademarks 
We consider securing and protecting our intellectual property rights to be important to the business. We own approximately 59 active U.S. utility patents on various components used in our products and systems and approximately 184 active U.S. design patents. We also own approximately 494 patents and design rights in various foreign countries. The scope and duration of our patent protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product. In particular, patents for individual products extend for varying periods of time according to the date a patent application is filed, the date a patent is granted and the term of patent protection available in the jurisdiction granting the patent (generally 20 years from the date of filing in the U.S., for example). We believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. We own approximately 106 trademark registrations in the U.S., including registrations to the following trademarks, as well as related stylized depictions of the Knoll word mark: Knoll®, KnollExtra®, Knoll Luxe®, KnollStudio®, KnollTextiles®, Good Design Is Good Business®, Antenna®, Calibre®, Currents®, Dividends®, Edelman® Leather, Modern Always®, Pixel®, Reff®, Sapper XYZ®, Spinneybeck® Leather, Toboggan®, Generation by Knoll®, Regeneration by Knoll®, MultiGeneration by Knoll®, Remix®, Rockwell Unscripted®, HighLine®, HOLLY HUNT®, GREAT OUTDOORS A HOLLY HUNT COLLECTION®, VLADIMIR KAGAN®, MUUTO® and FULLY®. 
We also own approximately 338 trademarks and copyrights registered in foreign countries. The scope and duration of our trademark protection varies throughout the world, with some countries protecting trademarks only as long as the mark is used, and others requiring registration of the mark and the payment of registration (generally ten years from the date of filing in the U.S., for example). In order to protect the indefinite duration, we make filings to continue registration of our trademarks. 
In October 2004, we received registered trademark protection in the United States for five iconic furniture designs by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe-the Barcelona Chair, the Barcelona Stool, the Barcelona Couch, the Barcelona Table and the Flat Bar Brno Chair. In 2019, we received similar registered trademark protection for the iconic Eero Saarinen design for the Womb Chair. This protection recognizes the renown of these designs and reflects our commitment to ensuring that when architects, furniture retailers, businesses and individuals purchase a Ludwig Mies van der Rohe design, they are acquiring the authentic product, manufactured in accordance with the designer's historic specifications. Barcelona® is a registered trademark in the U.S., Canada and European Community owned by Knoll, Inc.
Environmental Matters 
We believe that we are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other related activities has had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, but has, since 1990, been accomplished without having a material adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs as a result of such laws and regulations. We have trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements. Our goal is to reduce and, wherever possible, eliminate the creation of hazardous waste in our manufacturing processes. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations and technology, based on information currently known to management, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, competitive position, or cash flows. The operation of manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, however, and we cannot be certain that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect our operations. 
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or “CERCLA,” for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites previously used by us. CERCLA can impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault or the legality of disposal and, under certain circumstances, liability may be joint and several resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Liability may also include damages for harm to natural resources. The remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these CERCLA sites are unknown. We may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to CERCLA sites. We reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2019, we employed a total of 3,734 people, consisting of 1,891 hourly and 1,833 salaried employees. The Grand Rapids, Michigan plant is the only unionized plant within North America and has an agreement with the Carpenters Union, Local 1615, of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Affiliate of the Carpenters Industrial Council (the “Union”), covering approximately 187 hourly employees or 5.0% of the Company's labor force. The Collective Bargaining Agreement was entered into on May 1, 2018 and expires in April 2022. We expect the agreement to terminate as during the second quarter of 2020 due to the previously announced closure of the Grand Rapids, Michigan facility announced in January 2020. From time to time, there have been unsuccessful efforts to unionize at our other North American locations. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Nonetheless, it is possible that our employees may continue attempts to unionize. Certain workers in the facilities in Italy are also represented by unions.
