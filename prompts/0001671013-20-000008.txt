ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Cardtronics plc provides convenient automated consumer financial services through its global network of automated teller machines and multi-function financial services kiosks (collectively referred to as “ATMs”). As of December 31, 2019, we were the world’s largest ATM owner/operator, providing various services to approximately 285,000 ATMs globally.
During 2019, approximately 64% of our revenues were derived from our operations in North America (including our ATM operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico), approximately 29% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Europe and Africa (including our ATM operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Spain, and South Africa), and approximately 7% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Australia and New Zealand. As of December 31, 2019, we owned and operated approximately 74,000 ATMs, many located in well-known retail locations across our markets. These company-owned ATMs accounted for approximately 87% of our total ATM operating revenues during 2019.
Also included within our network as of December 31, 2019 were approximately 198,000 ATMs to which we provided processing services or various forms of managed services solutions. Under a managed services arrangement, retailers, financial institutions, and ATM distributors rely on us to handle some or all of the operational aspects associated with operating and maintaining ATMs, typically in exchange for a monthly service fee, a fee per transaction, a fee per service provided, or a combination of these fees. 
We provide various ATM-based financial services at retail locations and other high-traffic locations, such as shopping malls, airports, train stations, and casinos. In doing so, we provide our retail partners with a compelling automated financial services solution that helps attract and retain customers. We also partner with financial institutions and other providers of consumer financial services to enable convenient and fee-free access to our ATMs via our surcharge-free solutions. Finally, we provide managed service ATM solutions for retailers and financial institutions with a complete range of service offerings related to ATMs, including electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) transaction processing services, along with many other ATM-related services, depending on the needs of the customer.
We generally operate ATMs under three arrangement types with our retail partners: Company-owned ATM placements, merchant-owned ATM placements, and managed services (which includes transaction processing services). Under Company-owned arrangements, we provide the physical ATM and are typically responsible for all aspects of the ATM’s operations, including transaction processing, managing cash and cash delivery, supplies, and telecommunications, as well as routine and technical maintenance. Under merchant-owned arrangements, the retail merchant, financial institution or an independent distributor owns the ATM and is usually responsible for providing cash and performing simple maintenance tasks, while we generally provide more complex maintenance services, transaction processing, and connection to the EFT networks. We also offer various forms of managed services depending on the needs of our customers. Each managed service arrangement is a customized ATM management solution that can include any combination of the following services: monitoring, maintenance, cash management, cash delivery, customer service, transaction processing, and other types of related services. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 26% of our ATMs operated were Company-owned, and approximately 74% of our ATMs were merchant-owned or operated under a managed services solution. Each of the arrangement types described above are attractive to us and we plan to continue growing our revenues under each arrangement type.
In addition to our retail merchant relationships, we also partner with leading financial institutions to brand selected ATMs within our network, including but not limited to BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc. (“BBVA”), Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (“Citizens”), Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (“Cullen/Frost”), Discover Bank (“Discover”), PNC Bank, N.A. (“PNC Bank”), Santander Bank, N.A. (“Santander”), TD Bank, N.A. (“TD Bank”), United Services Automobile Association ("USAA") in the U.S.; BMO Bank of Montreal (“BMO”), the Bank of Nova Scotia (“Scotiabank”), Canadian Imperial Bank Commerce (“CIBC”), and TD Bank in Canada; the Bank of Queensland Limited (“BOQ”) and HSBC Holdings plc (“HSBC”) in Australia; and Capitec Bank ("Capitec"), Mercantile Bank ("Mercantile") and Old Mutual ("Old Mutual") in South Africa. In Mexico, we partner with Scotiabank and Banco Multiva by putting their brands on our ATMs in exchange for certain services provided by them. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 21,000 of our ATMs were under a bank-branding contract with approximately 500 financial institutions to place their logos on the ATMs and to provide convenient surcharge-free access for their banking customers. We also provide managed service offerings for financial institutions, which generally include full outsourcing of a portion or all of the financial institution's ATMs.
We also own and operate the Allpoint network (“Allpoint”), the largest surcharge-free ATM network (based on the number of participating ATMs). Allpoint, with approximately 58,000 participating ATMs, provides surcharge-free ATM access to nearly 1,200 participating credit unions, banks, digital banks, financial technology companies, and stored-value debit card issuers that are principally located in North America. For participants, Allpoint provides scale, density, and convenience of surcharge-free ATMs that surpasses the largest banks in the U.S. In exchange, Allpoint earns a fixed monthly fee per cardholder and/or a fixed fee per transaction that is paid by participants. Allpoint includes a majority of our Company’s ATMs in the U.S., and certain ATMs in the U.K., Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Allpoint also provides services to organizations that manage stored-value debit card programs on behalf of corporate entities and governmental agencies, including general-purpose, payroll, and electronic benefits transfer (“EBT”) cards. Under these programs, the issuing organizations pay us a fee per issued stored-value debit card or per transaction in return for allowing the users of those cards surcharge-free access to Allpoint’s ATM network.
Our revenues are generally recurring in nature and historically have been mainly derived from convenience transaction fees, which are paid by cardholders, as well as other transaction-based fees, including interchange fees, which are paid by the cardholder’s financial institution or card issuer for the use of the ATMs serving their customers and connectivity to the applicable EFT network that transmits data between the ATM and the cardholder’s financial institution. Other revenue sources include: (i) fees from financial institutions that participate in Allpoint, (ii) fees for bank-branding ATMs and providing financial institution cardholders with surcharge-free access, (iii) revenues earned by providing managed services (including transaction processing services) solutions to retailers and financial institutions, (iv) fees earned from foreign currency exchange transactions at the ATM, known as dynamic currency conversion (“DCC”), and (v) revenues from the sale of ATMs and ATM-related equipment and other ancillary services.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage the expertise, scale, and network we have built in our largest markets and to continue to expand in those markets. We believe there are significant growth opportunities for our business as the consumer financial services industry transforms with new consumer payment options, changes in consumer payments behavior and the evolution of traditional retail banking. These dynamics and trends have caused banks to continue to reduce their physical branch locations across the markets in which we operate, making our ATMs more attractive as digital-to-physical solutions for the customers of both traditional banks and new emerging consumer financial services companies. With our significant network of ATM locations, comprehensive solutions, extensive expertise, and operating history, we believe we can provide value to consumer financial services organizations of all sizes and grow our revenues and profits.
We plan to drive additional transactions at our existing ATMs by making them increasingly attractive to use by banks and their customers by promoting the convenience of our network and offering additional services and capabilities. We also intend to expand our capabilities and service offerings to financial institutions and digital financial service providers, with whom we are seeing increasing demand for outsourcing of ATM-related services, including, in some cases, management of in-branch ATMs. Additional demand for our products and services is, in part, being driven by banks reducing the number of physical branches they operate and bank initiatives to lower their operating and capital costs. Furthermore, many start-up or challenger banks and providers of consumer financial services are increasingly valuing our convenient ATM network to provide physical cash-related services to their customers. Additionally, we seek to deploy additional products and services that will further incentivize consumers to utilize our network of ATMs. We also plan to continue partnering with leading financial institutions and retailers to expand our network of conveniently located ATMs. In the future, we may seek to diversify our revenues beyond the services provided by our ATMs. We seek to capitalize on opportunities to expand our operations through the following efforts:
Expand our relationships with leading financial institutions. Through our extensive network of ATMs as well as our diverse product and service offerings, we believe we can provide financial institution customers with convenient solutions to fulfill their growing ATM and automated consumer financial services requirements. Services currently offered to financial institutions include bank-branding, deposit solutions, surcharge-free access provided to their cardholders, managed services for their ATM portfolios and on-screen marketing and content management. Our EFT transaction processing platforms enable us to provide customized control over the content of the information appearing on the screens of our ATMs and ATMs we process for financial institutions, which increases the types of products and services we are able to offer to financial institutions. We also plan to continue growing the number of ATMs and financial institutions participating in our Allpoint network, which drives higher transaction volumes and profitability on our existing ATMs and increases our value to the retailers where our ATMs are located through increased foot traffic at their stores. We are seeing increasing demand from financial institutions for the outsourcing of ATM-related services, as recent industry trends have caused many banks to reduce their physical footprints and transform their existing branches to focus less on human tellers and increasingly utilize automation, through ATMs and other digital channels, for serving their customers.
Work with non-traditional financial institutions and card issuers to further leverage our extensive ATM network. We believe there are opportunities to develop or expand relationships with non-traditional financial institutions and card issuers, such as reloadable stored-value debit card issuers, digital-only balances held by consumers, and alternative payment networks, which are 
seeking an extensive and convenient ATM network to complement their card offerings and electronic-based accounts. Additionally, we believe that many of the stored-value debit card issuers in the U.S. can benefit by providing their cardholders with access to our ATM network on a discounted or free-to-use basis. For example, through our Allpoint network, we have sold access to our ATM network to issuers of stored-value debit cards to provide their cardholders with convenient, surcharge-free access to cash. Additionally, challenger digital banks and providers of consumer financial services that lack a physical branch or ATM network of their own have partnered with us to provide their customers with convenient and free access to ATM services.
Increase transaction levels at our existing locations. We believe there are opportunities to increase the number of transactions that are occurring today at our existing ATM locations. On average, only a small fraction of the individuals that enter our retail customers’ locations utilize our ATMs. In addition to our existing initiatives that tend to drive additional transaction volumes to our ATMs, such as bank-branding and network-branding, we have developed and are continuing to develop new initiatives to drive incremental transactions to our existing ATM locations. We also operate and continue to develop programs to steer cardholders of our existing financial institution partners and members of our Allpoint network to visit our ATMs in convenient retail locations. These programs may include incentives to cardholders, such as coupons and rewards, that influence customers to visit our ATMs within our existing retail footprint. We also continue to invest in data analytics to better understand the usage patterns of our ATMs to help us identify opportunities for growth. We also include growth in transaction volumes as an incentive compensation metric for our relationship managers to help drive discussions with our existing financial institution partners to implement programs to drive their customers toward our ATMs. While we are in various stages of developing and implementing many of these programs, we believe that these programs, when properly structured, benefit multiple constituents, (i.e., retailers, financial institutions, and cardholders), in addition to driving increased transaction volumes to our ATMs, creating a synergistic network.
Increase our number of deployed ATMs with existing and new merchant relationships. Certain of our retail customers continue to expand the number of active store locations they operate, either through acquisitions or through new store openings, thus providing us with additional ATM deployment opportunities. Additionally, we seek opportunities to deploy ATMs with new retailers, including retailers that currently do not have ATMs, as well as those that have existing ATM programs, but that are looking for a new ATM provider. We believe our expertise, broad geographic footprint, strong record of customer service, and significant scale positions us to successfully market to and enter into long-term contracts with additional leading merchants.
Develop and provide additional services at our existing ATMs. The majority of our ATMs in service currently offer only cash dispensing and other simple transactions, such as balance inquiries. We believe that there are opportunities to offer additional automated consumer financial services at our ATMs, such as cash and check deposit, cardless cash access, and other products which could provide a compelling and cost-effective solution for financial institutions and stored-value debit card issuers looking to provide convenient and broader financial services to their customers at well-known retail locations. During 2019, we installed nearly one thousand deposit-taking ATMs in select markets throughout the United States and reached agreements with several financial institutions to provide their customers with access to these deposit-taking ATMs. We also allow advertisers to place their messages on our ATMs equipped with on-screen advertising software in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Offering additional services at our ATMs, such as advertising or cardless cash access, allows us to create new revenue streams from assets that have already been deployed in addition to providing value to our customers through beneficial offers and convenient services. We are focused on developing additional products and services that can be delivered through our existing ATM network.
Pursue additional managed services opportunities. Over the last several years, we expanded the number of ATMs that are operated under managed services arrangements. Under these arrangements, retailers and financial institutions generally pay us a fixed management fee per ATM and/or a fixed fee per transaction in exchange for handling some or all of the operational aspects associated with operating and maintaining their own ATMs. Surcharge and interchange fees under these arrangements are generally earned by the retailer or the financial institution rather than by us. As a result, in this arrangement type, our revenues are partially protected from fluctuations in transaction levels of these ATMs and changes in network interchange rates. We continue to pursue additional managed services opportunities with leading merchants and financial institutions in the markets in which we operate.
Additionally, we may grow in other markets and potentially expand into new international markets over time in order to enhance our position as a leading global provider of automated consumer financial services. For additional information related to items that may impact our strategy, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Developing Trends and Recent Events.
Our Products and Services
Under our Company-owned arrangement type, we typically provide all of the services required to operate ATMs, which include monitoring, maintenance, cash management, customer service, and transaction processing. We believe our customers, including our retail and financial institution customers, value our high level of service, industry expertise, and established operating history. In connection with the operation of our ATMs under our traditional ATM services model, we earn revenue on a per transaction 
basis from the surcharge fees charged to cardholders for the convenience of using our ATMs and from interchange fees charged to cardholders’ financial institutions for processing the transactions conducted on our ATMs. As further described below, we also earn revenues on these ATMs from branding with certain financial institutions and from our surcharge-free network, Allpoint. The Company-owned arrangement currently accounts for approximately 87% of our total ATM operating revenues.
Under our merchant-owned arrangement type, we typically provide transaction processing services, certain customer support functions, and settlement services. We generally earn interchange revenue on a per transaction basis in this arrangement. In some cases, the surcharge is earned completely by the merchant, in which case our revenues are derived solely from interchange revenues. In other arrangements, we also share a portion of the surcharge revenues.
For ATMs under managed services arrangements (including transaction processing arrangements), we typically receive a fixed monthly management fee and/or a fixed fee per transaction in return for providing the agreed-upon service or suite of services. We do not generally receive surcharge and interchange fees in these arrangements, but rather those amounts are earned by our customer.
We also earn revenues from other services at our ATMs, such as DCC fees, on-screen advertising, and other transaction-based fees across our various arrangement types.
The following table summarizes the number of ATMs under our various arrangement types as of December 31, 2019:

 | ATM Operations 
 | Company - Owned | Merchant -Owned, Managed Services and Processing | Total
Number of ATMs at period end | 74,482 | 212,291 | | 286,773
Percentage of Total ATMs | 26% | 74% | 100% 
Percentage of ATM Operating Revenue | 87% | 13% | 100% 

We have found that the primary factor affecting transaction volumes at a given ATM is its location. Therefore, our strategy in deploying ATMs, particularly those placed under Company-owned arrangements, is to identify and deploy ATMs at locations that provide high visibility and high retail transaction volume. Our experience has demonstrated that the following locations often meet these criteria: convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, drug stores, transportation hubs (e.g., airports and train stations), casinos, and other major regional and national retail outlets.
We have entered into multi-year agreements with many well-known merchant retailers, including Bi-Lo Holdings, LLC, Circle K Procurement and Brands Limited (“Couche-Tard”), Cumberland Farms, Inc., CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”), HEB Grocery Company, L.P., The Kroger Co., The Pantry, Inc., Rite Aid Corporation, Safeway, Inc., Speedway LLC (“Speedway”), Target Corporation, and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens”) in the U.S., BP p.l.c., BT Group plc, Co-operative Food (“Co-op Food”), Martin McColl Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc, Southern Railway Ltd., Tates Ltd., Waitrose Ltd., and Welcome Break Holdings Ltd. in the U.K.; 7-Eleven, Inc. in Canada and Australia as well as Coles Supermarket Australia Pty Ltd. in Australia; Massmart Holdings Ltd. and Shoprite Holdings Ltd. in South Africa; and Total in Germany.
We generally operate our ATMs under multi-year contracts that provide a recurring and stable source of revenue and typically have an initial term of approximately five years. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s top five merchant customers were Co-op Food, Couche-Tard, CVS, Speedway, and Walgreens. No individual customer accounted for more than 6% of the Company’s total revenue in 2019. Together these merchant customers accounted for approximately 22% of our total revenues and had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 3.5 years. For additional information related to the risks associated with our customer mix, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us, or substantially reduce their dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
Additionally, we enter into arrangements with financial institutions to brand selected Company-owned ATMs with their logos. These bank-branding arrangements allow a financial institution to expand its geographic presence for less than the cost of building a branch location or placing one of its own ATMs at a new location and can also rapidly increase the bank's number of branded 
ATM sites and improve its competitive position. Under these arrangements, the financial institution’s customers have access to use the bank-branded ATMs without paying a surcharge fee to us. In return, we typically receive a fixed management fee per ATM from the financial institution, while retaining our standard fee schedule for other cardholders using the bank-branded ATMs. In addition, our bank-branded ATMs typically earn higher interchange revenue as a result of the increased usage of our ATMs by the branding financial institution’s customers and others who prefer to use a bank-branded ATM. In some instances, we have branded an ATM with more than one financial institution. We intend to continue pursuing additional bank-branding arrangements as part of our growth strategy.
In addition to our bank-branding arrangements, we offer credit unions, banks, digital banks, and stored-value debit card issuers and other providers of consumer financial services another type of surcharge-free solution to their customers through our Allpoint surcharge-free ATM network. Under Allpoint, participants pay us a fixed monthly fee per cardholder and/or a fixed fee per transaction in exchange for us providing their cardholders with surcharge-free ATM access to approximately 58,000 participating ATMs in Allpoint, which includes ATMs throughout the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, and Australia. We also earn interchange revenues on each transaction performed, which is paid to us by the consumer’s financial institution. We believe Allpoint is an attractive option for providers of consumer financial services of all sizes to provide convenient consumer ATM-related services.
For additional information related to the amount of revenue contributed by our various service offerings, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Components of Revenues, Costs of Revenues, and Expenses - Revenues.
Segment and Geographic Information
We operate in three segments: North America, Europe & Africa, and Australia & New Zealand. Our North America segment includes ATM operations in all 50 states in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico, and accounted for approximately 64% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Europe & Africa segment includes our ATM operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Spain, and South Africa, and accounted for approximately 29% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our Australia & New Zealand segment includes ATM operations in Australia and New Zealand and accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. While each of the reporting segments provides similar kiosk-based and/or ATM-related services, each segment is managed separately and requires different marketing and business strategies.
For financial information including revenues, earnings, and total assets of our reporting segments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 22. Segment Information. For additional information related to the risks associated with our international operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We operate in many sovereign jurisdictions across the globe and expect to continue to grow our business in new regions. Operating in different countries involves special risks, which could result in a reduction of our gross and net profits.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams are typically organized by customer type across retail and financial industries. We have teams focused on developing new relationships with national, regional, and local merchants, as well as building and maintaining relationships with our existing merchants and ATM distributors. In addition, we have sales and marketing teams focused on developing and managing our relationships with financial institutions, financial technology companies, and stored-value debit card issuers as we look to expand the types of services that we offer to such organizations. Our sales and marketing teams also focus on identifying potential managed services opportunities with financial institutions and retailers alike. We maintain sales teams in each of the geographic markets in which we currently operate.
In addition to targeting new business opportunities, our sales and marketing teams support our customer retention and growth initiatives by building and maintaining relationships with our existing merchants. We seek to identify growth opportunities within merchant accounts by analyzing ATM cardholder patterns and recommending programs that will tend to increase transaction volumes. We also analyze foot traffic and various demographic data to determine the best opportunities for new ATM placements, as well as the potential drivers for increasing same-store ATM transactions that will positively impact merchant store sales. Employees who focus on sales are typically compensated with a combination of incentive-based compensation and base salary.
Technology and Operations
Our technology and operations platforms consist of ATMs, central transaction processing systems, network infrastructure components, (including hardware, software, and telecommunication circuits used to provide real-time ATM monitoring, software distribution, and transaction processing services), cash management and forecasting software tools, customer service, information 
security, and ATM management infrastructure. In most of our markets, except for our U.K. operations, a portion of our operations are outsourced to other providers, particularly with respect to physical cash delivery and physical maintenance services. Inclusive of both our internal capabilities and our partnerships, we offer end-to-end ATM service solutions for our retailer and financial partners, which we believe is a competitive advantage.
Transaction processing. We place significant emphasis on providing quality service with a high level of security and minimal interruption. We have carefully selected support vendors and systems, as well as developed internal professional staff to optimize the performance of our network. We operate our own EFT transaction processing platforms, which enables us to process and monitor transactions on our ATMs and to control the flow and content of information appearing on the screens of such ATMs. We have also implemented new products and services, such as dynamic currency conversion. 
Internal systems. Our internal systems, including our EFT transaction processing platforms, include multiple layers of security to help protect the systems from unauthorized access. We use hardware-based and software-based security features to prevent and report unauthorized access attempts to our systems. We operate user authentication and security measures at multiple levels. These systems are protected by detailed security rules only to allow appropriate access to information based on the employee’s job responsibilities. Changes to systems are controlled by policies and procedures, with automatic prevention and reporting controls that are placed within our processes. Our real-time connections to the various financial institutions’ authorization systems that allow withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, transfers, and advanced functionality transactions are accomplished through gateway relationships or direct connections. We use commercially-available and proprietary software that monitors the performance of the ATMs in our network, including details of transactions at each ATM and expenses relating to the ATMs, further allowing us to monitor our online availability and financial profitability at each location. We analyze transaction volume and profitability data to determine whether to continue operating at a given site, to determine how to price various operating arrangements with merchants and bank-branding partners, and to create a profile of successful locations to assist us in deciding the best locations for additional deployments.
Product development. In recent years, we have made investments to develop new technology which we anticipate will drive transaction volume at our ATMs. We have a product development team focused on improving existing products and services as well as delivering new capabilities that generally leverage our existing platform. Internal product development is an increasing focus for us, and we expect, over time, our product development will drive revenue growth. Examples of recent and continued product development include dynamic currency conversion at the ATM, promotional consumer offers, deposit enablement for multiple financial institutions, cardless cash access via a mobile phone and the ability to convert stored value digital currency into cash and cash into stored value digital currency at the ATM. A number of products are currently in various stages of development, pilot, and rollout.
ATM cash management. Our ATM cash management function uses commercially-available software and proprietary analytical models to determine the necessary fill frequency and cash load amount for each ATM. We project vault cash requirements for our Company-owned and cash-serviced ATMs, taking into consideration the ATM's location, the day of the week, the timing of holidays, and other factors such as specific events occurring in the vicinity of the ATM. After receiving a cash order from us, the vault cash provider forwards the request to its vault location nearest to the applicable ATM. Personnel at the vault location then arrange for the requested amount of cash to be set aside and made available for the designated armored courier to access and subsequently transport to the ATM. Our ATM cash management department utilizes data from the vault cash providers, internally-produced data, and a proprietary methodologies to confirm daily orders, audit delivery of cash to armored couriers and ATMs, monitor cash balances for cash shortages, coordinate and manage special cash orders, and audit costs from both armored couriers and vault cash providers. In the U.K., we operate our own armored courier operation which services the majority of our ATMs in the U.K. 
Customer service. We believe one of the factors that differentiates us from our competitors is our customer service and proactive approach to managing any downtime experienced by our ATMs. We use advanced software and skilled technicians that monitor our ATMs 24 hours a day for service interruptions and notify our maintenance engineers and vendors for prompt dispatch of necessary service calls.
Finally, we use proprietary software systems to maintain a database of transactions and performance metrics for our ATMs. This data is aggregated into individual merchant and financial institution customer profiles that are used by our customer service team. We believe our proprietary databases enable us to provide superior quality and reliable customer support, together with information on trends that is also valuable to our retail and financial institution partners.
Primary Vendor Relationships
To maintain an efficient and flexible operating structure, we outsource certain aspects of our operations, including cash supply and cash delivery, maintenance, and certain transaction processing services. Due to the large number of ATMs we operate, we believe we have obtained favorable pricing terms from most of our major vendors. We contract for the provision of the services described below in connection with our operations.
Transaction processing. We own and operate EFT transaction processing platforms that utilize proprietary as well as commercially-available software. A portion of our withdrawal transactions are processed through third-parties. We plan to convert transaction processing services to our internal EFT transaction processing platforms when economically advantageous to us or as these contracts expire or are terminated.
EFT network services. Our transactions are routed over various EFT networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances. EFT networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions, as well as the amount paid to us. We attempt to maximize the utility of our ATMs to cardholders by participating in as many EFT networks as practical. Additionally, we own and operate the Allpoint network, the largest surcharge-free network in the U.S. Having this network further enhances our ATM utility by providing certain cardholders surcharge-free access to our ATMs, as well as allowing us to receive network-related economic benefits such as receiving additional transaction-based revenue and setting interchange rates on transactions over this network.
Equipment. We purchase our ATMs from global ATM manufacturers, including, but not limited to, NCR, Hyosung, Triton, Diebold, and Chungho. The large quantity of ATMs that we purchase from these manufacturers enables us to receive favorable pricing and terms. In addition, we maintain close working relationships with these manufacturers in the course of our business, allowing us to stay informed about product updates and to receive prompt attention for any technical problems with purchased ATM equipment. The favorable pricing we receive from these manufacturers also allows us to offer certain of our customers an affordable solution to replace their ATMs with modern technology and to be compliant with new regulatory requirements as they arise.
Maintenance. We generally contract with third-party service providers with national operations for on-site maintenance services in most of our markets. In the U.K., Australia, Canada, and South Africa, maintenance services are , to differing degrees, performed by in-house technicians as well.
ATM cash management. We obtain or use our own cash to fill our Company-owned ATMs, and in some cases, merchant-owned and managed services ATMs, under arrangements with various vault cash providers. We pay a monthly fee based on the average outstanding vault cash balances to our primary vault cash providers under a floating rate formula, which is generally based on various benchmark interest rates such as London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). In virtually all cases, beneficial ownership of the cash is retained by the vault cash providers and we have no right to the cash and no access except for the ATMs that are serviced by our wholly-owned armored courier operations in the U.K. While our U.K. armored courier operations have physical access to the cash loaded in the ATMs, beneficial ownership of that cash remains with the vault cash provider at all times. We also contract with third-parties to provide us with certain cash management services, which varies by geography, which may include reporting, armored courier coordination, cash ordering, cash insurance, reconciliation of ATM cash balances, claims processing with armored couriers, financial institutions, and processors.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we had an average outstanding vault cash balance of approximately: $1.9 billion in our North America ATMs.; approximately $1.1 billion in our Europe and Africa ATMs; approximately $0.2 billion in our Australia and New Zealand ATMs. For additional information related to our vault cash agreements and the related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We rely on third-parties to provide us with the cash we require to operate many of our ATMs. If these third-parties were unable or unwilling to provide us with the necessary cash to operate our ATMs, we would need to locate alternative sources of cash to operate our ATMs or we would not be able to operate our business. Also see, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in interest could increase our operating costs by increasing interest expense under our credit facilities and our vault cash rental costs.
The vault cash that we are contractually responsible for in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate is insured up to certain per location loss limits and subject to per-incident and annual aggregate deductibles through a syndicate of multiple underwriters.
Cash replenishment. We contract with armored courier services to transport and transfer most of the cash to our ATMs. We use leading third-party armored couriers in all of our jurisdictions except for in the U.K., where we primarily utilize our own armored courier operations. Under these arrangements, the armored couriers pick up the cash in bulk using instructions received from us and our vault cash providers to prepare the cash for delivery to each ATM on the designated fill day. Following a 
predetermined schedule, the armored couriers visit each location on the designated fill day, load cash into each ATM, and then balance each machine and provide cash reporting to the applicable vault cash provider.
Merchant Customers
In each of our markets, we typically deploy our Company-owned ATMs under long-term contracts with major national and regional merchants including convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, drug stores, and other high-traffic locations. Our merchant-owned ATMs are typically deployed under arrangements with smaller independent merchants.
The terms of our merchant contracts vary as a result of negotiations at the time of execution. In the case of Company-owned ATMs, the contract terms vary, but typically include the following:

• | a multi-year term, typically approximately five years;


• | exclusive deployment of ATMs at locations where we install an ATM;


• | the right to increase surcharge fees, with merchant consent required in some cases;


• | in the U.S., our right to terminate or remove ATMs or renegotiate the fees payable to the merchant if surcharge fees or interchange fees are reduced or eliminated as a result of regulatory action; and


• | provisions that make the merchant’s fee dependent on the number of ATM transactions.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we derived approximately 22% of our total revenues from ATMs placed at the locations of our top five merchant customers, including revenues from bank branding and Allpoint at these locations, none of which individually contributed more than approximately 6% of our total revenues for the year. The weighted average remaining life of our top five merchant customers is approximately 3.5 years. For additional information related to the risks associated with our customer mix, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us, or substantially reduce its dealings with us could cause our revenues to decline significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Our overall business is somewhat seasonal in nature with generally fewer transactions occurring in the first quarter of the year. Transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during winter months as a result of decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. We usually see an increase in transactions in the warmer summer months, which are also aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. We expect these fluctuations in transaction volumes to continue in the future. In addition, other factors, such as a recessionary economic, environment or real, or potential health emergencies such as the widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, could hinder travel, reduce the use of cash and may have a negative impact on transaction levels.
Competition
Historically, we have competed with independent ATM deployers (commonly referred to as “IADs”) and financial institutions for ATM placements, new merchant accounts, bank-branding and network-branding relationships, and acquisitions. IADs compete with us for placement rights at merchant locations. Our ATMs compete with the ATMs owned and operated by financial institutions and other IADs for underlying consumer transactions. In certain locations with very high foot traffic, such as airports, major train stations, large arenas, and stadiums, we often see competition from large financial institutions as they may utilize such locations for marketing and advertising purposes, and in some cases are willing to subsidize the operations of the ATM.
We have established relationships with leading regional and national financial institutions, as well as digital banks, other operators of consumer financial services, and stored-value debit card issuers through our bank-branding program and Allpoint. Both of these programs can be cost-efficient alternatives to these organizations in lieu of operating branches and owning and operating extensive ATM networks. We believe the scale of our extensive network, our EFT transaction processing services, comprehensive solutions and our focus on customer service provide us with competitive advantages for providing services to leading financial institutions and newer providers of consumer financial services.
Through Allpoint, we have significantly expanded our relationships with local, regional, and national financial institutions as well as digital banks, providers of consumer financial services and other issuers of stored-value debit card programs in the U.S. With regard to Allpoint, we encounter competition from other organizations’ surcharge-free networks that are seeking to sell their network to retail locations and offer surcharge-free ATM access to issuers of stored-value debit cards, as well as financial institutions that lack large ATM footprints.
We work to continually develop the types of services we provide to financial institutions and merchants including management of their ATMs. With respect to our managed services offering, we believe we are well-positioned to offer a comprehensive ATM outsourcing solution with our breadth of services, in-house expertise, and network of existing locations that can leverage the economies of scale required to operate an ATM portfolio. There are several large financial services companies, ATM equipment manufacturers, and service providers that currently offer some of the services we provide, with whom we expect to compete directly in this area. While we have direct competition for providing certain services, we believe that we have unique advantages that will allow us to offer a variety of compelling solutions to financial institutions and retailers alike.
Acquisitions have historically been a consistent part of our strategy and may form part of our strategy in the future. Typically, competition for acquisitions is from other IADs, financial service or payments businesses, and/or private equity sponsors of ATM portfolios.
Finally, we face indirect competition from alternative payment mechanisms, such as card-based payments, including contactless, or other electronic forms of payment, including payment applications on mobile phones. While it has been difficult to specifically quantify the direct effects of alternative payment sources on our transaction volumes, cash-based payments have declined as a percentage of total payments in our primary geographic markets in recent years. Further expansion in electronic payment forms and the entry of new and less traditional competitors could reduce consumer demand for cash. We expect to continue to face competition from emerging payments technology in the future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - The proliferation of payment options and increasingly frictionless methods of payment other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, stored-value debit cards, contactless, and mobile payments options could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a resulting decline in the usage of our ATMs.
Government and Industry Regulation
Our principal business, ATM network ownership and operation, is subject to government (federal, state, or local) and industry regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services in such jurisdictions, as well as the imposition of civil fines. For additional information related to recent regulatory matters that have impacted our operations or are expected to impact us in the future, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Developing Trends and Recent Events. 
Risk Management
We have adopted a formalized Enterprise Risk Management program that seeks to identify and manage the major risks we face. The major risks are prioritized and assigned to a member of the management team who develops mitigation plans, monitors the risk activity, and is responsible for implementation of the mitigation plan, if necessary. The risks, plans, and activities are regularly monitored by our management team and overseen by our Board of Directors (“Board”).
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,987 employees, 326 of which were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We currently believe our relationships with employees represented by the union are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Organizational History and Additional Company Information
We were formed as a Texas corporation in 1993 and originally operated under the name of Cardpro, Inc. In June 2001, Cardtronics Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware and became the parent company for the existing business. In January 2004, Cardtronics Group, Inc. changed its name to Cardtronics, Inc. (“Cardtronics Delaware”), and in December 2007, we completed an initial public offering.
In July 2016, the location of incorporation of the parent company of the Cardtronics group of companies was changed from Delaware to the U.K., whereby Cardtronics plc, a public limited company organized under English law (“Cardtronics plc”), became the new publicly traded corporate parent of the Cardtronics group of companies following the completion of the merger between Cardtronics Delaware and one of its subsidiaries (the “Redomicile”). Upon completion of the Redomicile, Cardtronics plc common shares were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol “CATM,” the same symbol under which common shares of Cardtronics Delaware were formerly listed and traded. The Redomicile transaction was accounted for as an internal reorganization of entities under common control, and therefore, Cardtronics Delaware’s assets and liabilities have been accounted for at their historical cost basis and not revalued in the transaction.
A large portion of our growth throughout our operating history was driven by acquisitions as we expanded our operations in the U.S. and into several other new geographic markets in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Our largest markets are currently the U.S. and the U.K. Over the past few years, our growth strategy has been primarily focused on organic growth.
