During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also entered into agreements to settle certain outstanding litigation, including the pending class action lawsuit. In accordance with the terms of the agreements, certain defendants agreed to pay in the aggregate $1.025 billion, comprised of contributions from principals of the Company's former external manager, ARC Properties Advisors, LLC, (the “Former Manager”) totaling $225.0 million, $12.5 million from the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer (the “Former CFO”), $49.0 million from the Company’s former auditor, and the balance of $738.5 million from the Company. The contribution from the Company’s Former Manager and Former CFO were subsequently satisfied with a combination of (i) Limited Partner OP Units held by the Former Manager and the Former CFO, (ii) amounts due related to dividends on certain of 
such Limited Partner OP Units previously withheld from distribution, (iii) the value of substantially all of the Limited Partner OP Units and dividends surrendered to the Company in July 2019 as a result of a settlement by the Former Manager with the SEC, and (iv) cash paid by the Former Manager and Former CFO.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity
Credit Agreement
On May 23, 2018, the General Partner, as guarantor, and the OP, as borrower, entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provided for maximum borrowings of $2.9 billion, originally consisting of a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $900.0 million unsecured term loan facility (the “Credit Facility Term Loan,” together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facility”). In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, the OP repaid all of the outstanding obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 30, 2014 (as amended, the “2014 Credit Agreement”) and the 2014 Credit Agreement was terminated. Effective December 27, 2019, the Company reduced its Revolving Credit Facility capacity from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2019, $150.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the full $900.0 million was drawn on the Credit Facility Term Loan. 
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate $900.0 million notional amount, effective on February 6, 2019 and maturing on January 31, 2023, which were designated as cash flow hedges. Due to an improvement in the Company's credit rating during the fourth quarter of 2019, the interest rate spread on the $900.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan was reduced by 25 bps to LIBOR + 1.10%, and beginning on November 1, 2019, the swap agreements effectively fixed the Credit Facility Term Loan interest rate at 3.59%. 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $400.0 million, which were designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the anticipated issuance of long-term debt. 
Debt Activity
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s total debt decreased by $382.2 million, from $6.1 billion to $5.7 billion, primarily due to the redemption of the 2019 Senior Notes of $750.0 million, the redemption of the 4.125% senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) of $400.0 million, the repurchase of $80.7 million of the 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”), net repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility of $103.0 million and a reduction of $388.1 million in secured debt, offset by the issuance of the 3.10% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) of $600.0 million and borrowings on the Credit Facility Term Loan of $750.0 million. 
Common Stock Offering
On September 26, 2019, the Company completed a public equity offering (the "Offering"), selling a total of 94.3 million shares of Common Stock, which included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, for net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering expenses, of $886.9 million. The Company contributed the net proceeds from the Offering to the OP in exchange for additional General Partner OP Units, which have substantially identical economic terms as the Company’s Common Stock. Subsequent to September 30, 2019, the net proceeds of the Offering were used to pay amounts owed in connection with the settlement of certain litigation, as described in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies, and for general corporate purposes.
Common Stock Continuous Offering Programs
On September 19, 2016, the Company registered a continuous equity offering program (the “Prior Program”) pursuant to which the Company could offer and sell, from time to time, in “at-the-market” offerings or certain other transactions, shares of Common Stock with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $750.0 million, through its sales agents. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had issued 5.0 million shares under the Prior Program, at a weighted average price per share of $8.42, for gross proceeds of $42.5 million. The weighted average price per share, net of offering costs, was $8.30, for net proceeds of $41.8 million.
On April 15, 2019, the Company established a new continuous equity offering program pursuant to which the Company may sell shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750.0 million from time to time through April 15, 2022 in “at-the-market” offerings or certain other transactions (the “Current ATM Program”). The Current ATM Program replaced the Prior Program. The proceeds from any sale of shares under the Current ATM Program have been or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding potential acquisitions and repurchasing or repaying outstanding indebtedness. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had issued 9.0 million shares under the Current ATM Program, at a weighted average price per share of $9.60, for gross proceeds of $86.7 million. The weighted average price per share, net of offering costs, was $9.46, for net proceeds of $85.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $663.3 million available to be sold under the Current ATM Program. 
Share Repurchase Programs
On May 3, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated its prior share repurchase program and authorized a new program (the “2018 Share Repurchase Program”) that permitted the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of its outstanding Common Stock through May 3, 2019, as market conditions warranted. On May 6, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “2019 Share Repurchase Program”) that permits the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million of its outstanding Common Stock through May 6, 2022. Under the share repurchase programs, repurchases can be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured or derivative transactions, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions, or other methods of acquiring shares in accordance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at a specific time or in a specific situation, and repurchases are influenced by prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock, the Company’s financial performance and other conditions. Shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company under the share repurchase programs, if any, will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock.
There were no share repurchases under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program or the 2019 Share Repurchase Program during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $200.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2019 Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 0.8 million shares of Common Stock in multiple open market transactions, at a weighted average share price of $6.95 for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 million under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program. 
Series F Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred OP Units
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company redeemed a total of 12.0 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock, representing approximately 28.02% of the issued and outstanding preferred shares as of the beginning of the year. The shares of Series F Preferred Stock were redeemed at a redemption price of $25.00 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. 
As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 30.9 million shares of Series F Preferred Stock, approximately 30.9 million corresponding General Partner Series F Preferred Units and 49,766 Limited Partner Series F Preferred Units issued and outstanding.
Termination of Services Agreement with the Cole Purchaser (as defined below) 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s obligation to provide certain initial transition services for CCA Acquisition, LLC (the “Cole Purchaser”), an affiliate of CIM Group, LLC, terminated in accordance with the terms of the services agreement (the “Services Agreement”). Under the Services Agreement, the Company had continued to provide certain initial transition services to the Cole Purchaser and the Cole REITs subsequent to the sale of Cole Capital on February 1, 2018. The Company recorded $10.5 million of restructuring expenses related to the reorganization of its business after the sale of Cole Capital and cessation of initial transition services performed pursuant to the Services Agreement. Under the Services Agreement, the Company continues to be obligated to provide certain other services through December 31, 2023, which may be extended to December 31, 2024 under certain circumstances.
Primary Investment Focus
We own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of single-tenant retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate assets subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased properties that are strategically located and essential to the business operations of the tenant, as well as retail properties that offer necessity and value-oriented products or services. We actively manage the portfolio by considering several metrics including property type, tenant concentration, geography, credit and key economic factors for appropriate balance and diversity. We believe that actively managing our portfolio allows us to attain the best operating results for each asset and the overall portfolio through strategic planning, implementation of these plans and responding proactively to changes and challenges in the marketplace.
Investment Policies
When evaluating prospective investments in or dispositions of real property, our management considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property and business operations of the tenant, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. In this regard, our management will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject in certain instances to the approval of the Board of Directors.
As part of our overall portfolio strategy, we seek to lease space and/or acquire properties leased to creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting and operating guidelines. Prior to entering into any transaction, our corporate credit analysis and underwriting professionals conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality. In addition, we consistently monitor the credit quality of our portfolio by actively reviewing the creditworthiness of certain tenants, focusing primarily on those tenants representing the greatest concentration of our portfolio. This review primarily includes an analysis of the tenant’s financial statements either quarterly, or as frequently as the lease permits. We also consider tenant credit quality when assessing our portfolio for strategic dispositions. When we assess tenant credit quality, we, among other factors that we may deem relevant: (i) review relevant financial information, including financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity; (ii) evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and (iii) assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental revenue for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We are of the opinion that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants and mitigation options.
Real Estate Investments
As of December 31, 2019, the Company owned 3,858 operating properties comprising 89.5 million square feet of retail and commercial space located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, of which 99.1% was leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.3 years, which includes properties owned through consolidated joint ventures and the pro rata share of square feet and annualized rental income from the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures and omits the square feet of one redevelopment property. There were no tenants exceeding 10% of our consolidated annualized rental income as of December 31, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, properties located in Texas represented 12.8% and 12.5%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, tenants in the casual dining restaurant industry accounted for 12.0%, and 12.8%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, tenants in the manufacturing industry accounted for 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income.
Financing Policies
We rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns. We intend to finance future acquisitions with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, unsecured corporate-level debt, and other public, private or bank debt. In addition, we may acquire properties in exchange for the issuance of Common Stock or OP Units and we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. 
We also may obtain secured or unsecured debt to acquire properties, and we expect that our financing sources will include the public debt market, banks and institutional investment firms, including asset managers and life insurance companies. Although we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure, our charter does not contain a specific limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and the Board of Directors may implement or change target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.
We intend to continue to emphasize unsecured corporate-level or OP-level debt in our financing and to seek to reduce the percentage of our assets which are secured by mortgage loans. For information relating to our Credit Facility, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Competition 
We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties. We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. We also may face new competitors and, due to our focus on single-tenant properties located throughout the United States, and because many of our competitors are locally or regionally focused, we do not expect to encounter the same competitors in each region of the United States. Our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the properties that we have targeted for acquisition. Foreign investors may view the U.S. real estate market as being more stable than other international markets and may increase investments in high-quality single-tenant properties, especially in gateway cities. We may also incur costs in connection with unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover. 
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, health, safety and zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all material permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Our properties are also subject to laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), which require that all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Some of our properties may currently not be in compliance with the ADA. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance.
Environmental Matters 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current owner of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up contaminated property. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to impose cleanup responsibility and liability even if the owner did not know of and was not responsible for the contamination. For example, liability can be imposed upon us based on the activities of our tenants or a prior owner. In addition to the cost of the cleanup, environmental contamination on a property may adversely affect the value of the property and our ability to sell, rent or finance the property, and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
Prior to acquisition of a property, we will obtain Phase I environmental reports, or will rely on recent Phase I environmental reports. These reports will be prepared in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence based on our standards and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property and nearby or adjoining properties. We may also obtain a Phase II investigation which may include limited subsurface investigations and tests for substances of concern where the results of the Phase I environmental reports or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 160 employees.

Supplemental Federal Income Tax Considerations
This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. 
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus dated April 15, 2019 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2019.
The sixth sentence of the discussion under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - Distributions Attributable to Sale or Exchange of Real Property” is revised to read, “We must withhold 21% of any distribution that is a distribution attributable to USRPI gain,” such that the revised paragraph reads in full as follows:
Distributions Attributable to Sale or Exchange of Real Property. Except as discussed below with respect to 10% or less holders of regularly traded classes of stock, “qualified shareholders” and “qualified foreign pension funds” (for periods on and after December 18, 2015), for any year in which we qualify as a REIT, a Non-U.S. Stockholder will incur tax on distributions by us that are attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of USRPIs under special provisions of the U.S. federal income tax laws known as the Foreign Investment in Real Property Act, or FIRPTA. The term USRPIs includes interests in real property and shares in corporations at least 50% of whose real estate and business assets consist of interests in U.S. real property. Under those rules, a Non-U.S. Stockholder is taxed on distributions by us attributable to gain from sales of USRPIs as if the gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the Non-U.S. Stockholder. A Non-U.S. Stockholder thus would be taxed on such a distribution at regular tax rates applicable to U.S. Stockholders, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax. A corporate Non-U.S. Stockholder not entitled to treaty relief or exemption also may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax on such a distribution. We must withhold 21% of any distribution that is a distribution attributable to USRPI gain. A Non-U.S. Stockholder may receive a credit against its tax liability for the amount we withhold. However, FIRPTA and the 21% withholding tax will not apply to any distribution with respect to any class of our stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States if the recipient Non-U.S. Stockholder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of distribution. Instead, any distribution will be treated as an ordinary distribution subject to the rules discussed above.
The second sentence of the discussion under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding on Distributions not Subject to FIRPTA” is revised to read, “We also may be require to withhold tax at the rate of 21% on the portion of any dividend to a Non-U.S. Stockholder that is or could be designated by us as a capital gain dividend, even if not attributable to gain on a sale or exchange of an interest in U.S. real property,” such that the revised paragraph reads in full as follows:
U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding on Distributions not Subject to FIRPTA. For U.S. federal income tax withholding purposes, we generally will withhold tax at the rate of 30% on the amount of any distribution (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends or distributions of USRPI gain subject to FIRPTA as discussed above) made to a Non‑U.S. Stockholder, unless the Non‑U.S. Stockholder provides us with appropriate documentation (1) evidencing that such Non‑U.S. Stockholder is eligible for an exemption or reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, generally an IRS Form W‑8BEN or W-8BEN-E (in which case we will withhold at the lower treaty rate) or (2) claiming that the dividend is effectively connected with the Non‑U.S. Stockholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S., generally an IRS Form W‑8ECI (in which case we will not withhold tax). We also may be require to withhold tax at the rate of 21% on the portion of any dividend to a Non-U.S. Stockholder that is or could be designated by us as a capital gain dividend, even if not attributable to gain on a sale or exchange of an interest in U.S. real property. Such withheld amounts of tax do not represent actual tax liabilities, but rather, represent payments in respect of those tax liabilities described in the preceding 
two paragraphs. Therefore, such withheld amounts are creditable by the Non‑U.S. Stockholder against its actual U.S. federal income tax liabilities, including those described in the preceding two paragraphs. The Non‑U.S. Stockholder would be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld in excess of such Non‑U.S. Stockholder’s actual U.S. federal income tax liabilities, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
The paragraph under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders - Qualified Foreign Pension Funds” is replaced in its entirety, such that the revised paragraph reads in full as follows:
Qualified Foreign Pension Funds. For periods on or after December 18, 2015, for FIRPTA purposes neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” nor any “qualified controlled entity” is treated as a Non-U.S. Stockholder. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. A “qualified controlled entity” is an entity all the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund. Alternatively, under proposed Treasury Regulations that taxpayers generally may rely on, but which are subject to change, a “qualified controlled entity” is a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities or partnerships. Distributions received by qualified foreign pension funds and qualified controlled entities will be taxed as described above at - Distributions - In General regardless of whether the distribution is attributable to the sale of a USRPI. Gain of a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock as well as our capital gain dividends and distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock under the rules described above at - Distributions - In General, will not be subject to tax unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified foreign pension fund's (or the qualified controlled entity's, as applicable) conduct of a U.S. trade or business, in which case the qualified foreign pension fund (or qualified controlled entity) generally will be subject to a tax at the same graduated rates applicable to U.S. Stockholders, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, and may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments, in the case of a foreign corporation.
