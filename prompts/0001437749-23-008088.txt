ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Startek, Inc. (“Startek”, the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a global customer experience (CX) solution provider supporting some of the world’s most iconic brands across a variety of markets. Operating under the Startek and Aegis brands, we enable enterprises to create human-centered relationships with their end customers, transform CX and accelerate digital and artificial intelligence (AI) enablement across touchpoints and channels. We do this through CX and analytics services, technology-led innovation, engagement solutions, and a complete range of services that support the customer life cycle management (CLM) process. Our solutions are supported by over 33,000 employees, delivering services in 11 countries. Each day, our CX experts work together to deliver personalized, meaningful brand-led experiences.
 
The Company was founded in 1987, centered on supply chain management services, including packaging, fulfillment, marketing support, and logistics services. After our initial public offering on June 19, 1997, we increasingly focused on operating customer care contact centers and grew to include our current suite of CX offerings. To remain strategically competitive while expanding our reach with new and existing clients, we acquired several companies from 2013 to 2015. On July 20, 2018, the Company acquired CSP Alpha Midco Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (Aegis), which resulted in CSP Alpha Holdings Parent Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (Capital Square Partners or CSP) owning a majority of the Company's outstanding shares. Capital Square Partners, a Singapore-based private equity fund, owns approximately 56% of our outstanding shares. The combination greatly improved our competitive position in the market by providing us with access to many of the world’s most rapidly growing markets, offering services in many languages, offering a strong footprint and a foundation of operational excellence capabilities and industry best practices.
 
We offer CX solutions across industries with tailored expertise in the cable and media, telecom, e-commerce and consumer, healthcare and education, technology and related service, financial and business services, travel and hospitality, and utilities sectors. We serve over 140 clients globally, many of whom are industry leaders in their respective verticals and geographies. We understand the industries in which our clients operate and the unique challenges they face, we also understand the culture of the business or geography within which our services are delivered. We believe our knowledge of best practices across different industries coupled with an understanding of the solutions that can be implemented in the context of our clients’ operating environments, enables us to improve processes and performance metrics driving measurable results that differentiate our clients from their competitors. The trust and confidence that our clients have in us are underscored by the long relationships we enjoy with many of our key clients; we have worked with our top five clients for more than nine years on average. We hold the distinction of being a global company with a local approach, one that allows our customers to realize efficiencies by blending onshore, nearshore, and offshore service delivery. Our global capabilities enable us to build customized experiences across cultures and continents. 
 
During the year, the Company has classified Middle East and Argentina operations as 'Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' and accordingly discussions in the Business section pertains to continuing operations of the Company.

A digitally-driven, customer-centric and data-filled world requires intelligent decision-making. That means leveraging data, next-gen technologies and capabilities. It can be hard for organizations to uncover the insights hidden in their unstructured data. As CX solutions providers, Startek understands the value of the insights revealed by analytics. We leverage the latest technology to shape relationships, scale businesses, predict behaviors, segment customers and augment CX. This translates consumer insights and big data into initiatives that drive transformation and above-market growth.

Our Clients

We provide these services to clients from our delivery campuses across North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have a diverse client base of more than 140 clients across a variety of verticals, including Fortune 500 companies and disruptive start-ups. We are focused on the continued diversification of our client portfolio, targeting high-growth verticals such as retail and e-commerce, travel and hospitality, financial and business services and exploring emerging opportunities in healthcare and education. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, by industry served were as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2022

E-commerce & Consumer | 20% 
Financial & Business Services | 14% 
Media & Cable | 13% 
Travel & Hospitality | 13%

Other verticals | 3% 

 
During the year ended, December 31, 2022, our largest client, top five and ten clients represented 10%, 36% and 54% of total revenue, respectively. Master Service Agreements (MSAs) cover all our work for each client and are typically multi-year contracts that may or may not include auto-renewal provisions. Although they typically do not include contractual minimum volumes and can generally be terminated by the client without penalty upon prior written notice, our relationships with our top five clients have averaged around nine years, including multiple contract renewals for several of these clients.
 
Our clients’ CX needs continue to evolve and expand beyond basic order processing or first-tier contacts to handling complex issues that require advanced problem-solving skills and an in-depth understanding of their customers as well as a need to devise the most appropriate solutions to deliver personalized experiences and build a highly qualified talent pool able to deliver empathy-led CX.
 
Clients are increasingly seeking out solutions providers with the ability to effectively combine people, data and technology for the best combination of CX and cost efficiency. As such, our focus on attracting and retaining talent, leveraging the latest technology to deliver innovative solutions and the effectiveness of insights gained through the application of analytics, ensures we are a preferred partner for leading brands around the globe.
 
Key Competitive Differentiators
 
Our client base is predominantly comprised of leading global and regional brands. We believe our international footprint, world-class technology and human capital solutions are ideally suited for these clients. These brands increasingly seek CX partners who embrace customer-centricity and are capable of driving the innovation agenda to transform their CX delivery. With economic uncertainty driving organizations to consider how they can be more efficient while also continuing to build long-term customer relationships, we believe that our insights and analytics, technology-led innovation and customizable CX solutions differentiate us in the market place and position us for growth. Additionally, we believe our innovative human capital strategies and operational best practices represent key competitive advantages. The successful execution of our principal corporate strategies depends on our competitive strengths, which are briefly described below:
 
    4 

  

Scale and Global Footprint
 
We are a truly global business with global clients, global management teams, global best practices and global thinking. Our vast footprint provides clients with access to some of the world’s most rapidly growing markets and multilingual centers while our global approach ensures the institutionalization of operational best practices consistently across the globe. Our scale, breadth and capabilities support clients with global business requirements by providing CX services in the country, in location with close geographic proximity or an offshore location based on their needs.
Customer Experience and Design
 
Our digital approaches build differentiated CX every step of the way in order to build brand loyalty and lifetime value. We design and deliver CX solutions through an integrated omnichannel customer contact management offering. Our primary focus is enabling brands to devise contact strategies that maximize the benefits of each channel, reducing customer effort and increasing ease of use.
Customer Lifecycle Management
 
Understanding the lifetime view of the client or customer is key in obtaining enhanced value. From initial lead to building long-term brand loyalty, we enable our clients to build more meaningful relationships with their customers as part of an ongoing relationship. We offer cradle-to-grave multilingual solutions across the customer life cycle and fulfillment across digitally enabled multilingual channels. From data-driven insights, attracting and retaining customers to converting sales, we enable clients to deliver personalized one-to-one experiences.
Process Innovation and Optimization
 
We free our clients from the burden of repetitive, mundane processes that take up time and effort. We assist them with change management and lead them to streamlined, global processes that drive them to the next level of maturity. We use global best practices, tools and methodologies to automate their business process, and, above all, deliver quality assurance.
Technological Excellence: a Serious Approach to Digital
 
We believe that Startek provides clients with unmatched infrastructure stability. We utilize a combination of industry best practices, internally developed tools and a globally distributed team of engineers and support staff to centralize and standardize our worldwide delivery capabilities. This architecture enables us to deliver improved scalability and quality of delivery for our clients while lowering capital requirements and information technology operating costs. Through automation and machine learning, we seamlessly identify faults in third-party applications and route around or drive repair. The stability of our infrastructure allows us to provide seamless contact delivery while also focusing on developing and delivering new, innovative offerings, including chatbots, AI and neurolinguistic programming. Our IT solutions are not only technologically sound, but they also embody the principles of human communication science to ensure a more interactive experience for our clients’ customers.

Driving a superior CX for our clients is at the center of everything we do. Our agents are on the front lines every day working to build and maintain strong customer relationships that drive sales, satisfaction, and loyalty for our client's brands. To help us accelerate revenue growth across the globe, we will continue to invest in our core CX solutions, including strengthening our consulting and analytics capabilities, technology-enabled platforms, and embedding findings from research in human communication science.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business can be seasonal depending on our clients' marketing programs and product launches. These are often geared toward the end of summer and the winter holiday buying season in the U.S. and during major local festival seasons across our other geographies.
Industry
 
The industry is evolving to include key strategic elements beyond traditional contact centers and now includes CX consulting and digital CX services. Despite ongoing market consolidation through multiple mergers and acquisitions, this expanded scope of services driven by the digital CX needs of enterprises is likely to increase the market attractiveness for not only incumbent players but also for new providers with differentiated digital CX capabilities, according to industry research firm Everest Group.
Competition
 
The global customer experience management (CXM) market in which we operate is competitive. While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no single company is dominant in the industry. The industry itself continues to consolidate but remains very fragmented with the five largest competitors combined capturing less than 20% of the global market.
 
Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large, multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include client relationships, technology, and process innovation, integrated solutions, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, and financial strength. We primarily compete with in-house customer management operations and other companies that provide CX management, including Alorica, Concentrix, Sitel Group, TTEC, Teleperformance, and Transcom, among others. We also compete with smaller, specialized companies and divisions of multinational companies such as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, and Wipro, among others.
 
Many of these competitors are significantly larger than Startek in revenue, income, number of contact centers and customer service agents, number of product offerings and market capitalization. While Startek is smaller than many of our competitors, our focus, scale and ability to add value to our clients' businesses put us in an enviable position. Everest Group, for example, recently counted Startek among only 14 providers with the capabilities necessary to effectively support global CX delivery. Clients often select Startek to challenge larger players in the CXM space because they want more innovation, flexibility and speed to market.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws in the countries, states, and territories in which we operate, including tax, employment, environmental and other laws that govern the way we conduct our business. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including significant changes in domestic government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and taxation with respect to foreign operations; unexpected changes in foreign government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and labor laws; and difficulties in staffing and effectively managing foreign operations.
