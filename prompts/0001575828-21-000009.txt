Item 1. Business
General
    Frank’s International N.V. (“FINV”) is a Netherlands limited liability company (Naamloze Vennootschap) and includes the activities of Frank’s International C.V. (“FICV”), Blackhawk Group Holdings, LLC (“Blackhawk”) and their wholly owned subsidiaries (either individually or together, as context requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”). We were established in 1938 and are an industry-leading global provider of highly engineered tubular services, tubular fabrication and specialty well construction and well intervention solutions to the oil and gas industry. We provide our services and products to leading exploration and production companies in both offshore and onshore environments, with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells. We believe that we are one of the largest global providers of tubular services to the oil and gas industry. 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic, business and market disruptions is evolving rapidly, and its future effects are uncertain. The actual impact of these recent developments on our business will depend on many factors, many of which are beyond management's control and knowledge. It is therefore difficult for management to assess or predict with accuracy the broad future effects of this health crisis on the global economy, the energy industry or the Company. As additional information becomes available, events or circumstances change and strategic operational decisions are made by management, further adjustments may be required which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our Operations
    Tubular services involve the handling and installation of multiple joints of pipe to establish a cased wellbore and the installation of smaller diameter pipe inside a cased wellbore to provide a conduit for produced oil and gas to reach the surface. The casing of a wellbore isolates the wellbore from the surrounding geologic formations and water table, provides well structure and pressure integrity, and allows well operators to target specific zones for production. Given the central role that our services play in the structural integrity, reliability and safety of a well, and the importance of efficient tubular services to managing the overall cost of a well, we believe that our role is vital to the process of producing oil and gas.
    In addition to our tubular services offerings, we design and manufacture certain products that we sell directly to external customers, including large outside diameter (“OD”) pipe connectors. We also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of deepwater projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubulars (up to 400 feet in length) for use as caissons or pilings. We distribute large OD pipe manufactured by third parties, and generally maintain an inventory of this pipe in order to support our pipe sales and distribution operations. 
    We also provide specialized equipment, services and products utilized in the construction, completion and abandonment of the wellbore in both onshore and offshore environments. The product portfolio includes casing accessories that serve to improve the installation of casing, centralization and wellbore zonal isolation, as well as enhance cementing operations through advance wiper plug and float equipment technology.

Our Corporate Structure
    We are a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). As of February 17, 2021, based on the best information available to the Company, the Mosing family collectively owns approximately 47% of our common shares.
Description of Business Segments
    Tubular Running Services
The Tubular Running Services (“TRS”) segment provides tubular running services globally. Internationally, the TRS segment operates in the majority of the offshore oil and gas markets and also in several onshore regions with operations in approximately 40 countries on six continents. In the U.S., the TRS segment provides services in the active onshore oil and gas drilling regions, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale, Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale, and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Our customers are primarily large exploration and production companies, including international oil and gas companies, national oil and gas companies, major independents and other oilfield service companies.
    Tubulars
The Tubulars segment designs, manufactures and distributes connectors and casing attachments for large OD heavy wall pipe. Additionally, the Tubulars segment sells large OD pipe originally manufactured by various pipe mills, as plain end or fully fabricated with proprietary welded or thread-direct connector solutions and provides specialized fabrication and welding services in support of offshore deepwater projects, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubular assemblies up to 400 feet in length. The Tubulars segment also specializes in the development, manufacture and supply of proprietary drilling tool solutions that focus on improving drilling productivity through eliminating or mitigating traditional drilling operational risks.
    Cementing Equipment
    The Cementing Equipment (“CE”) segment provides specialty equipment to enhance the safety and efficiency of rig operations. It provides specialized equipment, services and products utilized in the construction, completion and abandonment of the wellbore in both onshore and offshore environments. The product portfolio includes casing accessories that serve to improve the installation of casing, centralization and wellbore zonal isolation, as well as enhance cementing operations through advance wiper plug and float equipment technology. Abandonment solutions are primarily used to isolate portions of the wellbore through the setting of barriers downhole to allow for rig evacuation in case of inclement weather, maintenance work on other rig equipment, squeeze cementing, pressure testing within the wellbore, hydraulic fracturing and temporary and permanent abandonments. These offerings improve operational efficiencies and limit non-productive time if unscheduled events are encountered at the wellsite.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
    We acquire component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including foundries, forge shops, and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our product lines (primarily pipe) are only available from a limited number of suppliers (primarily impacting the Tubulars segment).
    Our ability to source low cost raw materials and components, such as steel castings and forgings, is critical to our ability to manufacture our casing products competitively and, in turn, our ability to provide onshore and offshore casing services. In order to purchase raw materials and components in a cost effective manner, we have developed a broad international sourcing capability and we maintain quality assurance and testing programs to analyze and test these raw materials and components. 
Patents
    We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have a number of pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license as critical or essential to our business as a whole. 
Seasonality
    A substantial portion of our business is not significantly impacted by changing seasons. We can be impacted by hurricanes, ocean currents, winter storms and other disruptions. 
Customers
    Our customers consist primarily of oil and gas exploration and production companies, both in the U.S. and international markets, including major and independent companies, national oil companies, and other service companies that have contractual obligations to provide tubular services, well construction services or comparable services. Demand for our services and products depends primarily upon the capital spending of oil and gas companies and the level of drilling activity in the U.S. and in international markets. We do not believe the loss of any of our individual customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. One customer accounted for 13% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. All three of our segments generated revenue from this customer. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 
Competition
    The markets in which we operate are competitive. We compete with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources greater than ours. The principal competitive factors in our markets are the quality, price and availability of products and services and a company’s responsiveness to customer needs and its reputation for safety. In general, we face a larger number of smaller, more regionally-specific competitors in the U.S. onshore market compared to international and offshore markets, where larger competitors dominate. 
    We believe several factors give us a strong competitive position. In particular, we believe our products and services in each segment fulfill our customer’s requirements for international capability, range of services provided, intellectual property, technological sophistication, quality assurance systems and availability of equipment, along with reputation and safety record. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a rapid response to the needs of our customers, a high level of customer service and innovative product development initiatives. Although we have no single competitor across all of our product lines, we believe that Weatherford International represents our most direct competitor across our segments for providing tubular services, specialty well construction and well intervention services and products on an aggregate, global basis. 
Market Environment
    The full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting reduction in oil sector activity continues to evolve daily. However, with ongoing mass vaccination programs beginning to be deployed, we expect the market to respond positively throughout 2021. As COVID-19 responses have normalized and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia production cut agreements have remained in place, demand is expected to continue to draw down stockpiles of supply. While it is uncertain how long depressed energy demand will last, we anticipate international and U.S. offshore demand for our products and services to moderately increase from current levels as more customer projects come back online in 2021. Exploration and development spending continues to shift toward offshore and internationally focused projects, while U.S. land activity is anticipated to have a moderate recovery over the coming year. Activity in the deepwater offshore market is expected to improve as delayed projects resume and new projects commence throughout 2021. 
Inventories and Working Capital
    An important consideration for many of our customers in selecting a vendor is timely availability of the product or service. Often customers will pay a premium for earlier or immediate availability because of the cost of delays in critical operations. This availability is especially critical for our proprietary tubular products, causing us to carry inventories for these products. For critical capital items for which demand is expected to be strong, we often build certain items before we have a firm order. Having such goods available on short notice can be of great value to our customers. 
Inventories are required to be stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We may not be able to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Orders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of material or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects, and the imposition of orders or injunctions to prohibit or restrict certain activities or force future compliance.
Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), analogous state agencies and, in certain circumstances, individual citizens or organizations, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Certain environmental laws may impose joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The trend in environmental regulation is to typically place more stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA. Certain petroleum exploration and production wastes are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. However, it is possible that these wastes will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating expenses or the operating expenses of our customers, which could result in decreased demand for our services.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility from which a discharge occurs. In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) under the Obama Administration finalized a rule that would significantly expand the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, potentially expanding the areas that would require permits prior to commencing construction or exploration and production activities. However, the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration issued a final rule, made effective in December 2019, that repealed the 2015 rule and they also published a final rule in April 2020 re-defining the term “waters of the United States” as applied under the Clean Water Act and narrowing the scope of waters subject to federal regulation. The April 2020 final rule is subject to various pending legal challenges; moreover, there is an expectation that the Biden Administration may reconsider this April 2020 final rule. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water from our operations and may be required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil, including refined petroleum products.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other emission control requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at 
specified sources. Non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting non-compliant operations. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in 2015, the EPA under the Obama Administration issued a final rule under the CAA, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued attainment/nonattainment designations and, more recently in August 2020, the EPA under the Trump Administration published notice of a proposed action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard in accord with CAA requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter air emissions permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities could be subject to state “minor source” air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements applicable to air emissions, such as source registration and recordkeeping requirements. 
Climate Change
Climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and other countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the transport of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. 
In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden announced plans to take action with regards to climate change, has signed two executive orders to this effect on January 20, 2021, and is expected to pursue other climate change legislation, executive actions or other regulatory initiatives in the future to limit GHG emissions. Moreover, with the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions, as the EPA under the Obama Administration published final regulations under the CAA establishing standards for methane in 2016, but since that time the EPA under the Trump Administration has undertaken several measures to delay implementation of those standards, including one final rule published in September 2020 that rescinds the methane specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the oil and gas industry. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging EPA’s 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule and, on his first day in office, President Biden issued an executive order that, among other things, called for issuance of proposed rules by no later than September 2021 that would restore Obama-era rules for methane standards applicable to new, modified, and reconstructed sources by suspending, revising or rescinding the EPA’s September 2020 final rule and establish new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments.
Separately, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is a non-binding agreement, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. While the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement under the Trump Administration, effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. With the United States recommitting to the Paris 
Agreement, executive orders may be issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives may be adopted to achieve the agreement’s goals. 
Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States. In addition to re-committing to the Paris Agreement, other political actions indicated by President Biden during his campaign that could adversely affect the oil and gas industry include limiting hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters, limiting new leasing of federal lands or offshore waters for oil and gas exploration and production activities, potentially eliminating certain tax rules (referred to as subsidies) that benefit the oil and gas industry, and imposing restrictions on pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export facilities. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order, effective immediately, that suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. Subsequently, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order focused on combating climate change that, among other things, ordered: (i) the Secretary of the Interior to pause, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the issuance of new oil and gas leases on federal public lands and offshore waters (but excluding lands that the United States holds in trust for Indian tribes) pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters; and (ii) applicable agencies to identify fossil fuel subsidies provided by their respective agencies and subsequently take measures to ensure, to the extent consistent with applicable law, that federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels, with a further objective of eliminating fossil fuel subsidies from federal budget requests beginning in federal Fiscal Year 2022. In response, one industry group is already challenging the order, filing a lawsuit on January 27, 2021 in Wyoming federal district court and seeking to have the moratorium declared invalid.
There are also increasing risks of litigation related to climate change effects. Governments and third-parties have brought suit against some fossil fuel companies alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by marketing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. Similar or more demanding cases are occurring in other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, in December 2019, the High Council of the Netherlands ruled that the government of the Netherlands has a legal obligation to decrease the country’s GHG emissions, and other suits have been filed seeking to extend this obligation to private companies. Such litigation has the potential to adversely affect the production of fossil fuels, which in turn could result in reduced demand for our services.
Financial risks also exist for fossil fuel producers as shareholders who are currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies but are concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of production of crude oil and natural gas, which could in turn decrease demand for our services. Our own operations could also face limitations on access to capital as a result of these trends, which could adversely affect our business and results of operation.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in 
an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services and products. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar geothermal, tidal and biofuels) could reduce demand for hydrocarbons, and therefore for our products and services, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues. Over time, one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice in the oil and gas industry. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production of hydrocarbons. While we may provide supporting products through our Cementing Equipment segment, we do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our onshore customers utilize this technique. Certain environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies have suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and have made claims that hydraulic fracturing techniques are harmful to surface water and drinking water resources and may cause earthquakes. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly or indirectly. For example, in the United States, the EPA already regulates certain hydraulic fracturing operations involving diesel under the Underground Injection Control program of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Also, in 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) under the Obama Administration published a final rule imposing more stringent standards on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for chemical disclosure, well bore integrity, and handling of flowback water. However, in late 2018, the BLM under the Trump Administration published a final rule rescinding the 2016 final rule. Litigation challenging the BLM's 2016 final rule as well as its 2018 final rule rescinding the 2016 rule has been pursued by various states and industry and environmental groups. While a California federal court vacated the 2018 final rule in July 2020, a Wyoming federal court subsequently vacated the 2016 final rule in October 2020 and, accordingly, the 2016 final rule is no longer in effect but the Wyoming decision is expected to be appealed. Moreover, the BLM under a Biden Administration could seek to pursue regulatory initiatives that regulate hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. Additionally, in late 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water sources under some circumstances. States and local governments may also seek to limit hydraulic fracturing activities through time, place, and manner restrictions on operations or ban the process altogether. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs that restrict hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect, reduce or delay well drilling and completion activities, increase the cost of drilling and production, and thereby reduce demand for our services. There also exists the potential for the Biden Administration to pursue new or amended laws, regulations, executive actions and other regulatory initiatives that could impose more stringent restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including potential restrictions on hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands. 
Offshore Regulatory and Marine Safety
Spurred on by environmental and safety concerns, governing bodies from time to time have pursued moratoria and legislation or regulatory initiatives that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas, including areas where we or our oil and gas exploration and production customers conduct operations such as on the federal Outer Continental Shelf waters in the United States Gulf of Mexico. In the United States, President Biden has indicated his intent to ban new oil and natural gas permitting on federal lands and waters, including the OCS, and he may pursue regulatory initiatives, executive actions and legislation in support of his regulatory agenda. Additionally, regulatory agencies under the Biden Administration may issue new or amended rulemakings regarding deep water leasing, permitting or drilling that could result in more stringent or costly restrictions than those imposed under the Trump Administration as well as delays or cancellations to our customers with respect to their offshore operations. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order, effective immediately, that suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. Subsequently, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that, among other things, ordered the Secretary of the Interior to pause, to the extent consistent with applicable law, the 
issuance of new oil and gas leases on federal public lands and offshore waters (but excluding lands that the United States holds in trust for Indian tribes) pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. President Biden’s January 27, 2021 executive order establishing a moratorium on the issuance of new leases on these federal lands and waters is already subject to legal challenge by an industry group. 
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ("BOEM") and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") have over the past decade, primarily under the Obama Administration, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements with respect to new wells to be drilled in federal waters. However, in recent years under the Trump Administration, there have been actions by BSEE or BOEM seeking to mitigate or delay certain of those more rigorous requirements, including those relating to increased supplemental bonding and greater scrutiny or more rigorous assessment of blowout preventers, well design, well control and subsea containment requirements. BSEE and BOEM under the Biden Administration may reconsider rules or other regulatory initiatives implemented under the Trump Administration and pursue legislation, executive actions, rules or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards. Additionally, the Biden Administration may seek to pursue executive actions and legislation that could, among other things, significantly increase financial assurances of operators for decommissioning of offshore facilities on the OCS. The issuance of more stringent environmental and safety guidelines, regulations or moratoria for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico could disrupt, delay or cancel drilling operations, increase the cost of drilling operations or reduce the area of operations for drilling. The issuance of such requirements could dampen demand for our equipment and services and have an adverse effect on our business. 
Employee Health and Safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 
We also operate in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may impose similar legal requirements. Historically, our environmental and worker safety costs to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on us. However, we believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards and, thus, we cannot give any assurance that such costs will not materially adversely affect us in the future.
Operating Risk and Insurance
    We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. 
    Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery.
Human Capital
    We are committed to corporate responsibility efforts that help people across the globe live better lives and build sustainable, vibrant, stable communities where people can unlock their potential. We strive to consistently improve the ways in which we work to keep our employees safe, minimize our impact on the environment and ensure our governance is robust and transparent. Some of our key human capital areas of focus are described below.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,400 employees worldwide. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements or other similar arrangements in certain international areas in which we operate, such as Brazil, Africa and Europe. At December 31, 2020, approximately 11% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements, with 6% being under agreements that expire within one year. We consider our relations with our employees to be positive. Based upon the geographic diversification of our employees, we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole.
Safety
    Safety is one of our primary core values. Maintaining a strong safety record is a critical component of our operational success. Many of our customers have safety standards we must satisfy before we can perform services. As a result, we continually monitor and improve our safety performance through the evaluation of safety observations, job and customer surveys, and safety data. The primary measure for our safety performance is the tracking of the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”). TRIR is a measure of the rate of recordable workplace injuries, normalized on the basis of 100 full time employees for an annual period. The factor is derived by multiplying the number of recordable injuries in a calendar year by 200,000 and dividing this value by the total hours actually worked in the year. A recordable injury includes occupational death, nonfatal occupational illness, and other occupational injuries that involve loss of consciousness, lost time injuries, restriction of work or motion cases, transfer to another job, or medical treatment cases other than first aid. 
    The table below presents our worldwide TRIR for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | 2019 | | 2018
TRIR | 0.44 | | 0.64 | | 0.84

We have comprehensive compliance policies, programs and training that are applied globally to our entire workforce. Employees are required to complete COVID-19 trainings to adhere to safe and responsible work environments. We also standardize our global training processes to ensure all jobs are executed to high standards of safety and quality.
Diversity and Inclusion
We actively participate in industry initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion and the enhancement and development of human capital. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected from the highest levels in our organization by female representation in the executive ranks and on our Board of Directors. In addition, we actively support local content initiatives through sourcing and training local staff across our global network in approximately 40 countries on six continents. We look for opportunities to develop and promote local nationals to key positions within their home countries. Employee engagement is of paramount importance and ensuring fair and equitable treatment of our workforce is a cornerstone of our success.
Employee Learnings and Development
We invest in our people through learning and development programs that reinforce and update existing skill sets, and which develop employees’ competencies into new and complementary areas of expertise. We have created and foster on-going, global Communities of Learning where employees share expertise and knowledge to further the contribution of each person. We also actively solicit employee feedback and constantly strive to make the Company an employer of choice. We empower employees with an ownership mindset that encourages accountability and creativity – leading to new and better solutions.
Business Conduct and Ethics
We pledge to be forthright in all our business interactions and conduct our business with the highest ethical standards. That commitment extends to strict compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and business standards. We have comprehensive compliance policies, programs and trainings that are applied globally to our entire workforce. Our ethical foundation is laid with our Code of Business Conduct and all employees are educated on its contents and expected to observe it. Our compliance and ethics policies undergo regular review.
We require every employee worldwide to complete an online Code of Business Conduct and Ethics training course every year, which addresses conflicts of interest, confidentiality, fair dealing with others, proper use of company assets, compliance with laws, insider trading, keeping of books and records, zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment in the work environment, as well as reporting of violations. We have consistently achieved 100% annual completion of this requirement. Additionally, we require supervisors and managers to attend a live training session delivered by our internal counsel to further expand our expectations for them regarding their obligations to promote a work environment where all employees feel valued and respected. 
Employee Welfare and Development
We offer opportunities for a challenging career in an energetic and friendly work environment. Providing our workforce with a career path, training, fair pay, and challenging, rewarding work is the key to our success. Our benefit packages are tailored to the local market of operation and are designed to attract and retain the best talent in the industry.

SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
Our business is subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. Investors should consider the risks and uncertainties summarized below, as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
Our business is subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties:
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
•Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by oil and gas prices and other factors.
•The recent downturns in the oil and gas industry have negatively affected, and will likely continue to affect, our ability to accurately predict customer demand, causing us to potentially hold excess or obsolete inventory and experience a reduction in gross margins and financial results.
•Physical dangers are inherent in our operations and may expose us to significant potential losses. Personnel and property may be harmed during the process of drilling for oil and gas.
•We are vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•Our international operations and revenue expose us to political, economic and other uncertainties inherent to international business.
•To compete in our industry, we must continue to develop new technologies and products to support our operations, secure and maintain patents related to our current and new technologies and products and protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.
•We may be exposed to unforeseen risks in our services and product manufacturing, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
•We may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers to sustain or expand our current operations.
•We operate in an intensively competitive industry, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business will suffer.
•Our business depends upon our ability to source low cost raw materials and components, such as steel castings and forgings. Increased costs of raw materials and other components may result in increased operating expenses.
•We are subject to the risk of supplier concentration.
•Our services and products are provided in connection with operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry, and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.
•We may not be fully indemnified against financial losses in all circumstances where damage to or loss of property, personal injury, death or environmental harm occur.
•We may incur liabilities, fines, penalties or additional costs, or we may be unable to provide services to certain customers, if we do not maintain safe operations.
•Our business is dependent on capital spending by our customers, and reductions in capital spending in response to declining commodity prices will have a material adverse effect on our business.
•Events outside of our control, including a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the global outbreak of COVID-19, have materially adversely affected, and may further materially adversely affect, our business.
Risks Related to Accounting and Financial Matters 
•Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations may result in fluctuations in our cash flows and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
•Customer credit risks could result in losses.
•If our long-lived assets, goodwill, other intangible assets and other assets are impaired, we may be required to record significant non-cash charges to our earnings.
•Restrictions in the agreement governing our ABL Credit Facility could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Requirements
•Our operations and our customers’ operations are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our services and products or restrict our operations.
•Our operations are subject to environmental and operational safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.
•Our operations may be adversely affected by various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate relating to the equipment and operation of drilling units, oil and gas exploration and development, as well as import and export activities.
•The imposition of stringent restrictions or prohibitions on offshore drilling by any governing body may have a material adverse effect on our business.
•There are various risks associated with greenhouse gases and climate change legislation or regulations that could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.
•Legislation, rules, executive actions or regulatory initiatives restricting the use of hydraulic fracturing could reduce demand for our services and products.
•Our operations in countries outside of the United States are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Commerce Department.
•We are subject to extensive government laws and regulations concerning our employees, and the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be material.
Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure
•We are a holding company and our sole material assets are our direct and indirect equity interests in our operating subsidiaries, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from such subsidiaries to pay taxes and our corporate and other overhead expenses, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and pay dividends.
•The Mosing family holds a significant minority of the total voting power of the Company’s common stock and, accordingly, could have substantial control over selection of certain board positions.
•The Mosing family may have interests that conflict with holders of shares of our common stock.
•We are required under the Tax Receivable Agreement to pay Mosing Holdings for certain tax benefits we may claim, and the amounts we may pay could be significant. Although we may defer certain payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent we do not have sufficient cash to make such payments, any such unpaid obligation accrues interest, and we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock during any such deferral period.
•In certain cases, including in connection with certain mergers or other changes of control, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to Mosing Holdings may be accelerated and may significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
•Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity may dilute your ownership in us.
•Our declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our management board, with the approval of our supervisory board, and subject to certain limitations under Dutch law, and there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends.
•As a Dutch company with limited liability, the rights of our shareholders may be different from the rights of shareholders in companies governed by the laws of U.S. agencies.
•Our articles of association and Dutch corporate law contain provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt.
Risks Related to Tax Matters
•Changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results.
•We are a Netherlands limited liability company, and our U.S. holders may be subject to certain anti-deferral rules under U.S. tax law. For instance, U.S. tax authorities could treat us as a “passive foreign investment company,” which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders.
•U.S. “anti-inversion” tax laws could adversely affect our results, result in a reduced amount of foreign tax credit for U.S. holders, or limit future acquisitions of U.S. businesses.
