ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction



We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on July 31, 2020, for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses (the “Business Combination”).



Our sponsor is DJCAAC, LLC, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Sponsor”). The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on July 7, 2021. On July 12, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”) of 14,375,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,875,000 Units, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $143,750,000. Transaction costs of the IPO amounted to $9,998,781, comprised of $2,875,000 of underwriting fees paid at the time of the IPO, $5,031,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $655,031 of other offering costs, and $1,437,500 of the fair value of the representative shares, and was all charged to shareholders’ equity.



Substantially concurrently with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 7,250,000 warrants to the Sponsor and Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), the underwriter in the Initial Public Offering, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $7,250,000.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $146,625,000 (approximately $10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO, including a portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement, was deposited in a trust account (“Trust Account”), located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and was invested in permitted United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.



Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination.



We will have 12 months (or up to 21 months if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or July 12, 2023, to complete the initial Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). However, if we are unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will  (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay the our taxes (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Recent Developments



Merger Agreement



On January 30, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with (i) Figgreen Limited, a private limited company incorporated in Ireland with registered number 606356 (“Pubco”), (ii) Kalera Cayman Merger Sub, a Caymans Islands exempted company (“Cayman Merger Sub”), (iii) Kalera Luxembourg Merger Sub SARL, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“Lux Merger Sub” and, together with Cayman Merger Sub, the “Merger Subs”) and (iv) Kalera AS, a Norwegian private limited liability company (the “Kalera”).



Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, (i) a merger will occur, pursuant to which Cayman Merger Sub will merge with and into Agrico, with Agrico continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco (the “First Merger”) and Agrico will issue ordinary shares to Pubco (the “Agrico Share Issuance”) and the holders of ordinary shares will receive shares in the capital of Pubco and holders of warrants of Agrico will have their Agrico warrants assumed by Pubco and adjusted to become exercisable for shares in the capital of Pubco, in each case as consideration for the First Merger and the Agrico Share Issuance, (ii) at least one (1) business day following the First Merger and subject thereto, the second merger will occur, pursuant to which Lux Merger Sub will merge with and into Kalera with Kalera as the surviving entity of the second merger (the “Second Merger”) and in this context Kalera will issue shares to Pubco (the “Kalera Share Issuance”), and (iii) immediately following the Second Merger and the Kalera Capital Reduction (as defined below), the shareholders of Kalera (the “Kalera Shareholders”) (except Pubco) will receive shares in the capital of Pubco and the holders of Kalera’s outstanding options (the “Kalera Options”) will receive options in the capital of Pubco, in each case as consideration for the ordinary shares of Kalera (the “Kalera Shares”) and the Kalera Options being cancelled and ceasing to exist or being assumed (as applicable) upon completion of the Second Merger by way of a capital reduction pursuant to the Luxembourg Companies Act (the “Kalera Capital Reduction”). As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, Kalera will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco.



Upon consummation of the First Merger, (i) each Class A ordinary share of Agrico outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Merger Effective Time”) will be automatically cancelled in exchange for and converted into one ordinary share of Pubco (the “Pubco Ordinary Shares”), (ii) each Class B ordinary share of Agrico outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time will be automatically cancelled in exchange for and converted into one Pubco Ordinary Share, and (iii) each outstanding public Agrico Warrant (the “Agrico Public Warrants”) and private Agrico warrants will remain outstanding and will automatically be adjusted to become a Pubco Warrant.



Upon consummation of the Second Merger, each Kalera Share outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time will be cancelled and cease to exist in the context of the Kalera Capital Reduction against the issuance of (i) the number of Pubco Ordinary Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the aggregate number of Pubco Ordinary Shares so issued, the “Exchange Shares”) and (ii) one CVR per Kalera Share. “Exchange Ratio” means 0.091. The number of Exchange Shares will be determined prior to the Second Merger Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Business Combination Agreement and will cause, assuming no public shareholders of Agrico exercise their redemption rights, Kalera Shareholders to own approximately 52% of the issued and outstanding Pubco Ordinary Shares.



Consideration



The First Merger: Consideration to Agrico Security holders



The first transaction that comprises the Business Combination is the First Merger, pursuant to which Cayman Merger Sub will merge with and into Agrico, with Agrico surviving and being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco.



Upon consummation of the First Merger, (i) each Agrico Class A ordinary share outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time will be automatically cancelled in exchange for and converted into one Pubco Ordinary Share (ii) each Agrico Class B ordinary share outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time will be automatically cancelled in exchange for and converted into one Pubco Ordinary Share, and (iii) each outstanding Agrico Public Warrant and Agrico Private Warrant will remain outstanding and will automatically be adjusted to become a Pubco Warrant, respectively. As a result of the First Merger and the conversion or automatic adjustment (as applicable) of Agrico securities into securities of Pubco, the rights of Agrico security holders will change in material ways.





2







The Second Merger: Consideration to Kalera Security holders



At least one (1) business day following the First Merger and subject thereto, Pubco, Kalera and Lux Merger Sub will cause the Second Merger to be consummated, pursuant to which Lux Merger Sub will merge with and into Kalera with Kalera as the surviving entity of the Second Merger and in this context Kalera will issue shares to Pubco. Immediately following and in connection with the Second Merger, the Kalera Shareholders (except Pubco) will receive shares in the capital of Pubco and contractual contingent value rights (each a “CVR”), which represent the right to receive up to two contingent payments of Pubco Ordinary Shares, and the holders of the Kalera Options will receive options in the capital of Pubco and, in the case of holders of In-the-Money Options, CVRs, in each case as consideration for the Kalera Shares and the Kalera Options being cancelled and ceasing to exist or being assumed (as applicable) upon completion of the Second Merger by way of the Kalera Capital Reduction. Each CVR represents a contingent right to receive additional Pubco Ordinary Shares, issuable upon the achievement of certain milestones, including: (i) Pubco Ordinary Shares trading at or over a market price of $12.50; and (ii) Pubco Ordinary Shares trading at or over a market price of $15.00, in each case, for 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period, based on volume-weighted average trading prices. The amount of shares issuable to each CVR holder for the achievement of each milestone is, in each case, a pro rata portion of an amount of Pubco Ordinary Shares equivalent to 5% of the amount of Kalera Shares outstanding as of immediately following the Kalera Capital Reduction on a fully-diluted basis.



Upon consummation of the Second Merger, each Kalera Share outstanding immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time will be cancelled and cease to exist in the context of the Kalera Capital Reduction against the issuance of (i) the number of Pubco Ordinary Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio and (ii) one CVR per Kalera Share.



Closing of the Business Combination



The consummation of the First Merger and related transactions (the “First Closing”) will take place on the fifth business day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, unless Agrico and Kalera agree in writing to another date or time. The consummation of the Business Combination (other than those transactions which occur on the First Closing) (the “Second Closing” and together with the First Closing, the “Closings” and each, a “Closing”) will take place on the first business day after the First Closing, unless Agrico and Kalera agree in writing to another date or time.



Certain Related Agreements



Sponsor Support Agreement



In connection with their entry into the Business Combination Agreement, Agrico and Kalera entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement with DJCAAC LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed (i) to vote the Agrico ordinary shares held by them in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and approval of the business combination proposal and the Business Combination, (ii) to not transfer, during the period commencing on the date of the Sponsor Support Agreement and ending on the earlier of (a) the First Closing and (b) the liquidation of Agrico, any Agrico ordinary shares owned by the Sponsor, (iii) to not transfer any Lock-up Shares until the end of the Lock-up Period (each as defined therein), and (iv) to transfer to Agrico, surrender and forfeit a certain amount of Agrico’s Class B ordinary shares in the event that the amount of Agrico ordinary shares redeemed pursuant to the Redemption meet the threshold specified therein.



The foregoing description of the Sponsor Support Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the actual agreement, a form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated herein by reference.



Company Holders Support Agreements



In connection with their entry into the Business Combination Agreement, Agrico and Kalera entered into the Kalera Holders Support Agreement with certain shareholders of Kalera, whose names appear on the signature pages thereto (such shareholders, the “Major Shareholders”, and such agreement, the “Kalera Holders Support and Lock Up Agreement”), pursuant to which each Major Shareholder agreed (i) to vote all of such Major Shareholder’s Covered Shares (as defined therein) held by them in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination, (ii) to not transfer, prior to the date of the Second Closing, any of such Major Shareholder’s Covered Shares, and (iii) to not transfer any Lock-up Shares until the end of the Lock-up Period (each as defined therein).

Our Company



We are a newly incorporated Cayman Islands exempted company structured as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we intend to focus our search on targets in agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture that aim to improve yield, efficiency or profitability in the production, processing, distribution, provision of capital, or consumption of outputs, inputs, data, technology or other services (“AgTech”) located in the United the Americas.



Our management team believes that the intersection of agriculture and technology represents a tremendous opportunity for investment. The AgTech sector is focused on companies in agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture that aim to improve yield, efficiency or profitability in the production, processing, distribution, provision of capital, or consumption of outputs, inputs, data, technology or other services. With the world population projected to grow to 9.8 billion by 2050, the agriculture sector is being forced to do more with less. As a result of this disruption, a cross-section of technologies and disciplines are being used by progressive start-ups to boost global food supplies. In addition to increasing production, there is also a renewed focus on sustainability. There is a desire for better tracking, transparency, and security in our food system. Consequently, our management believes that their experience with innovative technologies and responsible natural resources will enable them to identify unique opportunities in the sector.



Our Management Team



Our management team consists of experienced deal makers, operators, and investors who have expertise working with companies across the global supply chain. Mr. de Jong, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has built technology, blockchain, and infrastructure companies around the world. Our board of directors has significant expertise operating and investing in companies across technology, agriculture, data analytics, infrastructure, and emerging markets. For further information on our management team’s experience, see the section titled “Management.”



Being based in Texas will allow us to leverage the substantial proprietary deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our management team and advisors, including relationships with business leaders and leading entrepreneurs. In addition, we intend to leverage the deep relationships and long-standing experience that our management team and strategic advisors command in the agricultural and technology venture capital and private equity sectors. We believe that this combination of relationships and experience will put us in an excellent position to locate potential targets, particularly those owned by private equity funds.



The past performance of the members of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management team or any of its affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance.



If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.

Business Combination Criteria



Our business combination criteria will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic sector, however, given the experience of our management team and board, we intend to focus our search on AgTech targets located in the Americas. We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are consistent with our acquisition philosophy and our management’s experience, and that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines to evaluate business combination opportunities, but we may decide to consummate our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet one or more of these criteria and guidelines.

● | Large and Compelling Growth Market. We will focus on investments in industry segments that we believe demonstrate attractive long-term growth prospects and reasonable overall size or potential. We view growth as an important driver of value and will seek companies whose growth potential can generate meaningful upside. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive, Inherently Profitable Business With High Operating Leverage. We will seek to invest in companies that we believe possess not only established business models and sustainable competitive advantages, but also have inherently profitable unit economics. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Management Teams. We intend to acquire a business that has an experienced management team with a proven track record for producing rapid growth and with an ability to clearly and confidently articulate the business and market opportunities to public market investors. As such, we will spend significant time assessing a company’s leadership and personnel and evaluating what we can do to augment and/or upgrade the team over time as needed. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity for Operational Improvements. We will seek to identify businesses that we believe are stable but at an inflection point and would benefit from our ability to drive improvements in the target’s processes, go-to-market strategy, product or service offering, sales and marketing efforts, geographical presence and/or leadership team. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Differentiated Products or Services. We will evaluate metrics such as recurring revenues, product life cycle, cohort consistency, pricing per product or customer, cross-sell success and churn rates to focus on businesses whose products or services are differentiated or where we see an opportunity to create value by implementing best practices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited Technology Risk. We will seek to invest in companies that have established market-tested products or service offerings, and do not lend themselves to erratic technology risks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Appropriate Valuations. We will seek target companies for our initial business combination based on disciplined valuation-centric metrics. Management has significant negotiating and operating experience and recognizes the initial valuation is an important component of the ultimate rate of return. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit From Being a Public Company. We intend to pursue a business combination with a company that we believe will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leading Industry Position and Competitive Market Advantage. We intend to focus on targets located in the Americas and operating within the AgTech sector, which we believe have strong fundamentals, favorable prospects and a high likelihood of generating strong risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. We will seek to acquire a business whose products utilize a proprietary or patented technology, have dominant market position in a specific geographic or technological niche, or have some other form of distinct competitive advantage. The factors we intend to consider include management’s credentials, growth prospects, competitive dynamics, level of industry consolidation, need for capital investment, intellectual property, barriers to entry, and merger terms. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential to Grow, Including Through Further Acquisition Opportunities. We will seek to acquire a business which has the potential to supplement its organic growth with a pipeline of potentially actionable acquisitions. We expect to work with the ongoing management team to develop the business strategy around geographic expansion, new products, high-return capital expenditure projects and acquisitions, as well as creating and maintaining the optimal capital structure for growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | High Organic Revenue Growth, Attractive Gross Margins, Prudent Debt. We will seek to acquire a business that will have the ability to grow rapidly across various market conditions and in varying economic cycles and the near-term potential to generate significant increases in revenue as well as strong and sustainable operating margins. To provide reliable guidance, we would also seek to acquire a business that has strong visibility on forward financial performance and straightforward operating metrics. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sourced on a Proprietary Basis. We do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes, but rather will aim to leverage our extensive network to source a proprietary initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we would consider participating in a process that is focused primarily on special purpose acquisition companies, where we would not compete with a conventional initial public offering or private equity acquisition, or at the tail end of a process when other alternatives have been eliminated, on the strength of our prior experience in closing business combinations or because our company is most appropriately sized to the target. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Preparedness for the Process and Public Markets. We will seek to acquire a business that has or can put in place prior to the closing of a business combination the governance, financial systems and controls required in the public markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we find an opportunity that has characteristics more compelling to us than the characteristics described above, we would pursue such opportunity.



Competitive Strengths and Advantages



We believe that our management team is well positioned to consummate an initial business combination due to its combination of operating and investing expertise. We believe that the most likely target business will be those companies at a strategic inflection point, such as rapidly growing companies stepping out from the control of private equity or venture capital owners, family owned businesses seeking some liquidity, or business units being carved out from larger conglomerates. In these scenarios in particular, we believe the experience our management team brings in successfully scaling companies, especially those in the public markets, will be looked upon favorably by both the target company as well as public shareholders.



Specifically, we believe our competitive strengths to be the following:




● | Experienced Management Team. Our management team and strategic advisors have a substantial investment track record and advisory experience, significant knowledge of blockchain technology and data analytics, access to proprietary deal flow, and strong relationships with business leaders and entrepreneurs in the agricultural and financial technology industries. We believe their backgrounds allow us access to proprietary investment opportunities and position us to successfully complete an initial business combination. In addition, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has prior experience in entrepreneurship, venture capital, public offerings, and acquisition led growth strategies across multiple industries but with a focus in the technology and infrastructure space. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flexible Structure. With a public market for our ordinary shares and $127,500,000 (or $146,625,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in trust, we have flexibility to be able to offer a target business a variety of options in structuring a transaction and funding future growth. Flexibility in using our shares, debt, cash or a mixture of the foregoing, allows us to work with a target company to accommodate their needs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Public Company Status. We believe our status as a public company will make us an attractive transaction partner to prospective target businesses. As a public company, we believe the target business would benefit from greater access to capital to fund future growth initiatives, further means of creating incentive and compensation plans for management that are closely aligned with shareholder’s interests, and increased recognition and awareness potentially benefitting sales and recruiting. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






6








● | Established Deal Sourcing Network and Personal Contacts. We intend to maximize our pipeline of potential target investments by proactively approaching our extensive network of contacts, including private equity and venture capital sponsors, family offices, executives of public and private companies, merger and acquisition advisory firms, investment banks, capital markets desks, lenders and other financial intermediaries. We believe the prior investment experience and track record of our team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s prior involvement in successful investments, will give us a competitive advantage when sourcing potential target business opportunities, relationships with private equity and venture capital firms, and through investment bankers who we believe are likely to provide us with potential combination targets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deal-making and Capital Markets Experience through all Market Cycles. Our management team and strategic advisors consist of seasoned dealmakers with experience in a wide variety of industries, structures and market conditions, as well as experienced equity and debt capital markets professionals. Most have worked in emerging markets, as principal investors and as advisors, through different market cycles. Our management team and strategic advisors intend to apply the same disciplined approach to acquire a business that they have used in connection with their current advisory services and principal investment activities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experience with Complex Transactions. Members of our management team and strategic advisors have a track record of completing transactions that involve an element of complexity not well-served by a competitive auction process and on educating counterparties about the benefits of the special purpose acquisition company structure and process. We believe that our management team and strategic advisors’ experience with complex situations requiring creative solutions is expected to lead to less competitive transactions. Members of our management team and strategic advisors also have a history of leveraging their relationship networks for due diligence and to develop a unique perspective and comfort with the issues faced in such complex opportunities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investment Expertise. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying, evaluating, structuring, acquiring, and investing in privately held companies. Collectively, the members of our management team alone have been involved with or led over 300 acquisitions and investments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad Sector Focused Expertise. Our management team brings deep expertise in a wide range of sub-sectors within our target industries. We believe that our diverse range of expertise increases our chances of identifying a business combination target where we have the expertise to appropriately diligence the investment and to provide value post business combination. Specifically, members of our management team have experience operating, investing or serving on boards of companies in the following sub-sectors: agriculture, technology, blockchain, infrastructure, data analytics, energy, and emerging markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees



We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.



For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on July 12, 2021.
