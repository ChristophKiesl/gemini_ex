Overview
 We are a biotechnology company committed to establishing the leading, fully integrated platform for precision genetic medicines. Our vision is to provide life-long cures to patients suffering from serious diseases. To achieve this vision, we have assembled a platform that includes a suite of gene editing and delivery technologies and are in the process of developing internal manufacturing capabilities. Our suite of gene editing technologies is anchored by our proprietary base editing technology, which potentially enables an entirely new class of precision genetic medicines that target a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. This approach uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at the targeted sequence. Our novel base editors have two principal components: (i) a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR, protein, bound to a guide ribonucleic acid, or RNA, that leverages the established DNA-targeting ability of CRISPR, but modified to not cause a double-stranded break; and (ii) a base editing enzyme, such as a deaminase, which carries out the desired chemical modification of the target DNA base. We believe this design contributes to a more precise and efficient edit compared to traditional gene editing methods, which operate by creating targeted double-stranded breaks in the DNA; these breaks can result in unwanted DNA modifications. We believe that the precision of our editors will dramatically increase the impact of gene editing for a broad range of therapeutic applications. 
 To unlock the full potential of our base editing technology across a wide range of therapeutic applications, we are pursuing a broad suite of clinically validated and novel delivery modalities. For a given tissue type, we use the delivery modality with the most compelling biodistribution. Our current programs are organized by delivery modality into three distinct pipelines: electroporation for efficient delivery to blood cells and immune cells ex vivo; lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, for non-viral in vivo delivery to the liver and potentially other organs in the future; and adeno-associated viral vectors, or AAV, for in vivo viral delivery to the eye and central nervous system, or CNS.
 The elegance of the base editing approach combined with a tissue specific delivery modality, provides the basis for a targeted efficient, precise, and highly versatile gene editing system, capable of gene correction, gene silencing/gene activation, or multiplex editing of several genes simultaneously. We are currently advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct editing targets, utilizing the full range of our development capabilities. We believe the flexibility and versatility of our base editors may lead to broad therapeutic applicability and transformational potential for the field of precision genetic medicines. 
 We continue to make meaningful advancements across our programs. Within our ex vivo platform, we have identified three development candidates to date – two candidates targeting hemoglobinopathies and one candidate in our T-cell therapy program:
  
• | BEAM-101 reproduces single base changes seen in individuals with Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, or HPFH, to potentially protect them from the effects of mutations causing sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia. We have achieved proof-of-concept in vivo with long-term engraftment of base edited human CD34 cells in mice for BEAM-101. Persistence of engraftment and high levels of editing have been confirmed in several preclinical studies, including in studies using material generated at a clinically relevant scale. Following conversations with regulators and supported by our off-target biology assays, we initiated IND-enabling studies in 2020 and expect to file an IND for BEAM-101 during the second half of 2021.

• | BEAM-102 directly corrects the causative mutation in sickle cell disease by recreating a naturally-occurring normal human hemoglobin variant, HbG-Makassar. During the second quarter of 2020, we published preclinical data on BEAM-102 demonstrating that our adenine base editors, or ABEs, can efficiently convert the causative Hemoglobin S, or HbS, point mutation, to HbG-Makassar, with high efficiency (more than 80%). In this preclinical study, the Makassar variant does not cause hemoglobin to polymerize and red blood cells to sickle and, therefore, edited cells are cured through elimination of the disease-causing protein. The results from this study confirmed the ability of the Makassar variant to protect cells from sickling, even in the context of mono-allelic editing (with one sickle allele and one corrected allele). We plan to initiate IND-enabling studies for BEAM-102 during 2021.

• | BEAM-201 is a potent and specific anti-CD7, multiplex edited, allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T cell, or CAR-T, development candidate for the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or T-ALL, a severe disease affecting children and adults with a five-year overall survival of less than 25%. BEAM-201 is produced using a Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, compliant, clinical-scale process in which T-cells derived from healthy donors are simultaneously base edited at four genomic loci, then transduced with a lentivirus coding for an anti-CD7 CAR. The resulting cells are universally-compatible, allogeneic (“off the shelf”) CD7-targeting CAR-T cells, resistant to both fratricide and immunosuppression. We plan to initiate IND-enabling studies for BEAM-201 during 2021.

We also continue to advance our liver disease programs. In 2020, we showed the ability to directly correct the mutation causing Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, providing both in vitro and in vivo preclinical proof-of-concept for base editing to correct this disease. We have also achieved editing levels in vivo, in preclinical models, for the correction of the two most prevalent mutations causing Glycogen Storage Disease Type IA, or GSDIa, that could be clinically relevant if reproduced in humans. An important next step for the liver disease programs is finalizing our LNP formulation, and we are making progress on developing a formulation using proof-of-concept targets. To date, with this formulation, we have shown high levels of editing in mice at doses consistent with clinical use. We are currently conducting non-human primate studies to evaluate our LNP formulation and anticipate initial data in the first half of 2021. We believe we are on track to nominate our first development candidate from our liver portfolio in the second half of 2021. 
 The modularity of our platform means that establishing preclinical proof-of-concept of base editing using a particular delivery modality will potentially reduce risk and accelerate the timeline for additional product candidates that we may develop targeting the same tissue. In some cases, a new product candidate may only require changing the guide RNA. Subsequent programs using the same delivery modality can also take advantage of shared capabilities and resources of earlier programs. In this way, we view each delivery modality as its own unique pipeline, where the success of any one program may pave the way for a large number of additional programs to progress quickly to the clinic.
 Background on current methods in genetic medicines
 The human genome has four types of bases found in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. The genome is comprised of over three billion of these base pairs in two intertwining strands of DNA; the sequence of these bases encodes genes. In a living cell, these DNA sequences are continuously copied into short ribonucleic acid transcripts, called messenger RNA, or mRNA, which are then translated into proteins that perform the functions of life. By precisely modulating the DNA sequence, it is possible to develop different therapeutic approaches. One of these approaches involves correcting misspellings in genes, known as mutations, which can yield proteins that are dysfunctional or missing altogether, causing disease. An additional example, involves modulating genes in immune cells that can improve the ability of these cells to kill certain cancers as, for example, in the case of CAR-T cells.
 In the last decade, the field of genetic medicine has reached an inflection point, with groundbreaking advances in gene therapy, cell therapy, oligonucleotides and, most recently, gene editing. Several medicines have been approved using a number of these technologies, including gene therapies, such as Luxturna®, Zolgensma®, Strimvelis®, and Zynteglo®; genetically modified cell therapies, such as Kymriah® and Yescarta®; oligonucleotide therapies, such as Onpattro® and Spinraza®; as well as the successful progression of several gene editing approaches to clinical trials in the United States and Europe. With the exception of oligonucleotides, which must be dosed chronically, each of these therapies has the potential for life-long outcomes with a single treatment.
 We believe we are well-positioned to accelerate progression of our base editing programs to clinical trials through potential approval by leveraging the clinical, regulatory, and manufacturing advancements made to date in the field of genetic medicine. In addition, we believe base editing technology has the potential to provide life-long cures after a single treatment by overcoming challenges associated with current methods in gene therapy and gene editing.
 Current challenges in gene therapy
 Gene therapy involves using viral vectors, including AAV or retroviruses such as lentiviruses, to deliver new copies of genes, or transgenes, to cells. Fine-tuning the level of expression of the transgene in different cell types and/or diseases can be challenging. Because transgenes are not inserted into the appropriate locus of the host genome, they do not benefit from endogenous regulation. In addition, since the mutated, disease-causing gene is still present, the effectiveness of the transgene may be diminished due to competition with the mutated protein.
 In the case of AAV gene therapy, life-long expression of the transgene is a significant hurdle, as life-long persistence of AAV expression has not yet been achieved in several organs, especially in muscles and the liver. Lack of persistence can be further exacerbated when treating children, since the transgene becomes diluted as the child grows and cells are rapidly dividing, as his/her organs expand. Finally, preexisting immunity may limit use in some patients altogether and certain immune responses may prevent redosing in the context of lack of persistence or low expression.
 Retroviral vectors, including lentiviral vectors, work by inserting a gene payload into the patient’s chromosome, typically ex vivo, and have demonstrated improved durability compared to AAV therapies. However, these vectors bear the risk of random genomic integration, which creates the potential of disrupting important genes or activating cancer-causing genes.
 Current challenges in gene editing
 Gene editing works by disrupting, inserting, or modifying genes in the natural context of the genome. The vast majority of existing gene editing methods rely on a class of enzymes, called nucleases, to make a double-stranded break in the DNA at a targeted location. These enzymes include CRISPR, Zinc Fingers, Arcuses, and TAL Nucleases, and, while these approaches have distinct technical features relative to each other, they make the same type of edit and, therefore, share several similar limitations.
 5


First, there is a lack of predictability in genetic outcomes when altering gene sequences with nucleases. The dominant, naturally-occurring DNA repair system that corrects double-stranded breaks within cells is called Non-Homologous End Joining, or NHEJ. This system can patch the broken ends of the chromosomes back together but will simultaneously insert or delete sequences at random near the location where the break occurs. While this NHEJ approach can be effective if the desired outcome is to knock out or switch off the whole gene, it does not allow for precise control of the specific genetic outcome at the target site and may vary from individual to individual.
 Second, there are potential toxicities associated with double-stranded breaks, such as cell death response and genomic instability. In addition, if the double-stranded break occurs in the wrong place, the break can also lead to unwanted gene disruptions. Multiple edits, and thus multiple double-stranded breaks, can compound this issue and lead to large-scale genomic translocations and rearrangements, potentially limiting the applicability of nuclease-based approaches in multiplex editing.
 Third, while gene disruption with nucleases is efficient, making specific sequence changes to correct or modify genes remains largely inefficient. To change a gene sequence, gene editing using nucleases relies on a DNA repair pathway called Homology Directed Repair, or HDR. HDR is a low-efficiency DNA repair pathway, typically yielding single digit percentage editing. This pathway also requires the simultaneous delivery of an additional DNA template containing the desired, corrected gene sequence, which needs to be positioned at the precise location where the double-stranded break has occurred. The requirement of an additional DNA template also significantly increases the complexity of delivery. More recently, approaches have been developed to insert sequences into certain highly expressed genes, such as the albumin locus in liver cells. This strategy can only be used to address diseases that are associated with circulating proteins, and the efficiency of these approaches remains low.
 Finally, gene editing through HDR does not allow for the correction of genes in non-dividing cells, since this DNA repair machinery is only expressed in dividing cells, further limiting their applications, given that the majority of cells in the adult body are non-dividing.
 Base editors: A potential new class of medicines that perform precision chemistry on genes
 Errors of a single base, known as point mutations, are the most common class of genetic mutations, representing approximately 58% of all the known genetic errors associated with disease. Other natural genetic variations of a single base among human populations, revealed by population-level genomic studies, are known to protect against certain diseases. Existing gene editing technologies, including CRISPR, Zinc Fingers, Arcuses and TAL Nucleases, typically do not edit at the single base level, due to the low efficiency of HDR. Instead, these technologies operate by creating a targeted double-stranded break in the DNA, and then rely on cellular mechanisms to complete the editing process. Such approaches can be effective in disruption of gene expression; however, they lack control of the editing outcome, have low efficiency of precise gene correction, and can result in unwanted DNA modifications.
 Our base editing technology is an entirely new therapeutic approach, potentially capable of altering the human genome at the foundational level of genetic information – a single base - without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. Base editing involves the enzymatic modification of a single type of base, at a targeted location directly on the gene; specifically C-to-T or A-to-G. The elegance and simplicity of this approach can be thought of as a “pencil”, where the error is erased and the correct letter is written. This approach, is designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at a targeted sequence, which can be used in a variety of editing strategies, including the correction of single mutations or the engineering of advanced cell therapies, aimed at providing a compelling therapeutic benefit. We believe, therefore, that base editors may have broad therapeutic applicability and transformational potential for the field of precision genetic medicines.
 Advantages of base editing
 We believe our base editing platform offers meaningful advantages over existing approaches in gene editing and gene therapy, including:
  
• | Highly precise and predictable gene editing, designed to make only one type of base edit at the desired target location
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly efficient and therapeutically relevant levels of gene correction, which are generally unachievable by nuclease-based methods
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applicability in a wide range of cell types, including both dividing and non-dividing cells
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct chemical modification of DNA with no requirement for delivery of the corrected DNA sequence
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avoidance of unwanted DNA modifications associated with double-stranded breaks, including gene disruptions and chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations or deletions
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The potential for permanent editing of genes, creating the opportunity for a life-long therapeutic outcome, including the ability to treat infants or young children since the edit will be passed on by dividing cells as the child grows
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Preservation of natural regulation and a normal number of copies of the gene in the cell by modification of genes in their native genomic setting
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatile and modular product engine that can target a different gene sequence with the same base editor and a different guide RNA
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our base editing platform
 Our novel DNA base editors have two principal components that are fused together to form a single protein: (i) a CRISPR protein, bound to a guide RNA, that leverages the established DNA-targeting ability of CRISPR, but modified to not cause a double-stranded break, and (ii) a base editing enzyme, such as a deaminase, which carries out the desired chemical modification of the target DNA base. This proprietary combination enables the precise and targeted editing of a single base pair of DNA, which has not been previously possible.
 CRISPR proteins enable precise targeting of genomic DNA sequences. They have been adapted and engineered over the years to target specific genomic locations with high specificity in human cells. CRISPR proteins incorporate a programmable component called a guide RNA. The guide RNA includes a region of approximately 20 bases, which allows the CRISPR protein to recognize any DNA sequence that is complementary to the guide RNA.
 This complementary sequence on DNA, also approximately 20 bases, is known as a protospacer. The short sequence of about three bases immediately following the protospacer on the genomic DNA is referred to as the protospacer adjacent motif, or PAM. The presence of the PAM is necessary for RNA-DNA pairing to occur when a matching protospacer sequence is present.
 The figure below is a graphical representation of the base editor and its components, including the guide RNA with the single-stranded portion that is complementary to the protospacer in the genomic DNA.
 
In our base editors, the first component is the CRISPR protein. We use a CRISPR associated protein 9, or Cas9, protein for our DNA base editors. We also have ongoing efforts to create base editors with other CRISPR associated, or Cas, proteins, including CRISPR associated protein 12b, or Cas12b, a nuclease that is proprietary to Beam. The targeting ability of the CRISPR protein has been preserved, but the cutting ability has been modified such that the CRISPR protein does not make a double-stranded break in the DNA. Our base editors benefit from an additional feature of the CRISPR protein, which, upon binding to its double-stranded DNA target, opens a four to five base single-stranded segment, known as the editing window.
 The second component of our base editors is a deaminase, a class of naturally occurring enzymes. For our Cytosine Base Editors, referred to as “CBEs,” we use a deaminase that acts only on single-stranded DNA. This helps to minimize edits in other parts of the genome, where DNA is predominantly double-stranded. Similarly, for our Adenine Base Editors, referred to as “ABEs,” we use a different, engineered deaminase that also acts only on single-stranded DNA.

The deaminase makes a predictable chemical modification, called deamination, of the amine group on either adenine or cytosine. As shown in the figure below, the conversion of an amine group of A results in the formation of inosine, which is read by the DNA polymerase as a G, which subsequently leads to an A-to-G change. The deaminase in a CBE will convert an amine group of C, resulting in the formation of uracil, which is read by the DNA polymerase as a T, which subsequently leads to a C-to-T change.
 

As shown in the figure below, the two components of our base editors, the CRISPR protein and the deaminase, are fused together to form a single protein. When introduced into a cell, the CRISPR targets the desired genomic location by recognizing a complementary section on the DNA to the section encoded in the guide RNA. The deaminase then makes the desired edit to a target base in the editing window.
 
In the example shown, a C is edited to a U on one strand of the DNA, which is read as a T. Once this strand has been edited, the intermediate DNA consists of an edited strand, containing a U at the target locus, and an unedited strand with a G. The U:G is a mismatch, which the cell will normally attempt to repair in a process that can potentially lose the edit. In order to preserve the editing, we modify the CRISPR in our base editors to cleave the unedited single strand of the DNA, referred to as nicking, rather than creating double-stranded breaks. Nicking increases the efficiency of editing by inducing the cell to use the newly edited strand, and not the unedited strand, as the template for repair, resulting in a U:A pair without any translocations. Upon DNA repair or replication, the U is read as a T, resulting in a T:A pair. Therefore, the permanent conversion of a C:G base pair to a T:A base pair is completed.
 Analogously, when an ABE is used instead of a CBE, an A:T pair is converted to a G:C pair. Because the DNA is double-stranded, by targeting the non-coding strand, we can also convert a T:A pair to a C:G and a G:C pair to a A:T pair in the coding strand. For example, using ABE to install an A-to-G edit on the non-coding strand of the DNA will cause a T-to-C change in the coding sequence of the gene once the base pair has been fully modified.
 The modular and individual components of our base editors can be rapidly customized for specific diseases, creating new therapeutic programs with significant efficiencies in development. By changing the guide RNA portions of the CRISPR protein, we can quickly and precisely retarget base editors to different genomic locations based on their gene sequences. By changing the deaminase, we can control which base is edited (e.g., C or A). As a result, we believe our base editing platform is highly versatile, efficient, and scalable for the discovery of drug candidates.

Diverse therapeutic applications of base editing
 We believe the unique advantages of our base editing platform – single base editing precision, predictable editing outcome, high editing efficiency, and the avoidance of double-stranded breaks – make base editing a compelling approach for a wide range of therapeutic applications. This includes gene correction, gene silencing and gene activation, as well as multiplex editing of several genes simultaneously.
  
• | Gene Correction - Errors of a single base, known as point mutations, are the most common form of genetic mutations, representing approximately 58% of all the known genetic errors associated with disease. For example, sickle cell disease is caused by a single point mutation at position 6 in the adult hemoglobin gene, while alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is caused by a single point mutation at position 342 in the SERPINA1 gene. We believe base editors may be an ideal tool for repairing point mutations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gene Silencing or Activation - Upregulation or downregulation, including silencing and activation, of gene expression is a desirable therapeutic approach to cure many diseases. The high level of precision of base editors is ideally suited to alter regulatory regions of genes, ensuring that only a few bases at precise locations are altered to achieve the desired effect without causing broader disruptions to adjacent regions that may still have important regulatory functions. For example, we have demonstrated re-activation of expression of fetal hemoglobin by precisely changing the regulatory region of the relevant genes, thus preventing one or more repressor proteins, including B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A, or BCL11A, from binding. Both our C and A base editors can also be used to silence the expression of genes, with editing rates that are highly comparable to those achieved with nuclease-based editors but without requiring a double-stranded break. Gene silencing, such as targeting surface proteins in a CAR-T cell, can be achieved either by the conversion of certain short gene sequences, called codons, into STOP codons or by the disruption of splice donor-acceptor sites, in each case with a single base conversion.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multiplex base editing - By avoiding the creation of double-stranded breaks, base editors are particularly advantageous for situations in which multiple sequences in the genome must be simultaneously edited. This could include targeting duplicated or repetitive sequences in the genome, as is the case with the identical regulatory regions of the two neighboring genes for fetal hemoglobin, or targeting several genes at once, such as in the creation of advanced cell therapies like CAR-T cells with a combination of features that could dramatically enhance their therapeutic potential. Base editors do not create double-stranded breaks, and we have demonstrated in cell lines that they can edit multiple locations simultaneously without causing any detectable chromosomal rearrangements. Additionally, there are manufacturing benefits as cells that have three or more nuclease edits appear to have a significant growth deficit compared to cells that have been edited the same number of times with a base editor. We believe that our base editors can provide a significant and meaningful advancement in therapies where more complex genome editing is required, such as targeting multiple sequences across the genome or creating highly engineered cellular therapies.

 Delivery of genetic medicines
 To complement our next-generation gene editing technologies, we are also making significant investments in a broad suite of delivery technologies to deliver our gene editing payloads to the right cells to enable potentially curative therapy. These delivery technologies include ex vivo electroporation, nonviral vectors such as LNPs, and viral vectors such as AAVs. In our pipeline, we have initially focused on applications of these technologies that are clinically-validated, such as ex vivo editing of blood stem cells or LNP delivery to the liver. Longer term, we are also investing in more innovative delivery options, such as LNPs that could target other organs beyond the liver, or novel viral vectors beyond AAV. We have also developed critical enabling capabilities such as mRNA manufacturing and cell processing for autologous and allogeneic cell therapy.
 Consistent with this approach, our recent acquisition of Guide Therapeutics, Inc., or Guide, expands our ability to explore new tissues and disease indications with our editing technologies. Guide’s proprietary platform technology, which utilizes DNA barcodes to enable high throughput in vivo LNP screening, provides us with access to an existing broad library of lipids and lipid formulations, and the ability to generate additional novel LNPs that we believe could accelerate novel nonviral delivery of gene editing payloads to tissues beyond the liver.

As shown in the figure below, we believe that building an integrated platform combining our gene editing capabilities with advanced delivery and manufacturing capabilities will give us the maximum flexibility to develop our own sustainable portfolio and to create a hub for partnering with other companies to unlock the full potential of precision genetic medicine across all possible applications.

Our base editing portfolio
 We believe building a diversified portfolio leveraging the full breadth of our delivery technologies in parallel will maximize our ability to provide life-long therapies to patients over the broadest possible range of diseases. We plan to advance multiple programs through clinical development in parallel, with each one potentially capable of delivering proof-of-concept in Phase 1 clinical studies in genetically defined patient populations and potentially reaching approval on an accelerated pathway. Our portfolio is purposefully built around a mix of strategic and technical profiles, creating significant optionality and risk diversification. We prioritize and advance programs based on a number of criteria, including high unmet medical need, editing feasibility, clinically validated delivery modalities, favorable clinical and regulatory development pathways, and evidence that base editing offers potentially compelling advantages for patients over available standards-of-care and novel therapeutic modalities in development.
 Our programs are organized by delivery modality into three distinct pipelines: electroporation for hematology and oncology cell therapy, LNP for the liver, and AAV for the eye and CNS. The following table summarizes the status of certain of our most advanced programs:
 


10


Ex vivo electroporation for hematology: Sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia 
 Electroporation is a clinically validated technology for the ex vivo delivery of various therapeutic constructs into harvested cells, which are then reintroduced into the body. Electroporation introduces nucleic acid or proteins into cells by discharging an electrical pulse across a cell membrane. With electroporation, we introduce the base editor into the hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs isolated from the patient’s blood, either as a messenger RNA, or mRNA, encoding the editor, or as a purified protein along with the guide RNA for a given target. Prior to receiving his/her edited cells, the patient undergoes a standard myeloablation procedure, which is also used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy, to remove all endogenous bone marrow HSCs. After the myeloablative procedure, the patient’s edited HSCs are re-infused back into the same patient. Once reinfused, the HSCs begin repopulating a portion of the bone marrow in a process known as engraftment. The engrafted, edited HSCs give rise to progenitor cell types with the corrected gene sequences. Our ex vivo portfolio includes two hematology programs, BEAM-101 (sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia) and BEAM-102 (sickle cell disease) and our lead oncology program, BEAM-201 (T-ALL). 
 Sickle cell disease, a severe inherited blood disease, is caused by a single point mutation, E6V, in the beta globin gene. This mutation causes the mutated form of HbS to aggregate into long, rigid molecules that bend red blood cells into a sickle shape under conditions of low oxygen. Sickled cells obstruct blood vessels and die prematurely, ultimately resulting in anemia, severe pain (crises), infections, stroke, organ failure, and early death. Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting an estimated 100,000 individuals, of which a significant proportion are of African-American descent (1:365 births). Beta-thalassemia is another inherited blood disorder characterized by severe anemia caused by reduced production of functional hemoglobin due to insufficient expression of the beta globin protein. Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, or TDBT, is the most severe form of this disease, often requiring multiple transfusions per year. Patients with TDBT suffer from failure to thrive, persistent infections, and life-threatening anemia. The incidence of symptomatic beta-thalassemia is estimated to be 1:100,000 worldwide, including 1:10,000 in Europe. In the United States, based on affected birth incidence of 0.7 in 100,000 births, and increasing survival rates, we expect the population of individuals affected by this disease to be more than 1,400 and rising. The only potentially curative therapy currently available for patients with sickle cell disease or beta-thalassemia is allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, or HSCT; however, this procedure holds a high level of risk, particularly Graft-versus-Host Disease, or GvHD, resulting in a low number of patients opting for this treatment.
 We are using base editing to pursue two complementary approaches to treating sickle cell disease and one to treat beta-thalassemia: 
  
• | a differentiated approach to elevating fetal hemoglobin which could be used in treatments for both sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia (BEAM-101); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a novel approach to directly correcting the sickle mutation (BEAM-102).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 BEAM-101: Recreating naturally-occurring protective mutations to activate fetal hemoglobin 
 The beneficial effects of the fetal form of hemoglobin, or HbF, to compensate for mutations in adult hemoglobin were first identified in individuals with a condition known as HPFH. Individuals who carry mutations that would have typically caused them to be beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease patients, but who also have HPFH, are asymptomatic or experience a much milder form of their disease. HPFH is caused by single base changes in the regulatory region of the genes, HBG1 and HBG2, which prevents binding of one or more repressor proteins and increases the expression of gamma globin, which forms part of the HbF tetramer. 
 Using base editing, we reproduce these specific, naturally occurring base changes in the regulatory elements of the gamma globin genes, preventing binding of repressor proteins and leading to re-activation of gamma globin expression, and thus the increase in gamma globin levels. Our in vitro and in vivo characterization of BEAM-101 using ex vivo delivery achieved precise and efficient editing of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, or HSPCs, resulting in long-term engraftment and therapeutically-relevant increases in target gene expression in mice. Additionally, there have been no observed guide-dependent or guide-independent off-target events for this program.
 In vitro characterization of BEAM-101:
  
• | We demonstrated greater than 90% editing in healthy donor CD34 cells in vitro.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We demonstrated gamma globin upregulation following erythroid differentiation is highly correlated (R2=0.993) with editing rates, where, at greater than 90% editing we achieve greater than 60% increase in gamma globin in healthy donor CD34+ cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Successful editing of CD34+ cells from a homozygous sickle cell disease patient, demonstrating a greater than 60% increase in gamma globin levels with a concomitant decrease to less than 40% sickle beta globin levels in vitro after in vitro differentiation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11


In vivo performance of BEAM-101:
  
• | We demonstrated that edited CD34+ cells from a healthy human donor engraft with high chimerism and maintain greater than 90% editing after 16 weeks in immunocompromised mice.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We demonstrated after 16-week engraftment that base edited cells lead to successful multilineage reconstitution with greater than 90% base editing achieved in sorted human HSPCs, myeloid, lymphoid and erythroid cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We replicated these findings with cells from a second donor at 18 weeks post-engraftment.

 Off-target profile of BEAM-101:
  
• | Two theoretical types of off-target events that are possible as a consequence of these edits are guide-dependent and guide-independent deamination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | To determine the potential for guide-dependent off-target editing, Beam evaluated BEAM-101 in a homology-dependent biochemical assay. No guide-dependent off-target effects were observed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) edited at a supra-saturating dose of BEAM-101.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additionally, Beam assessed guide-independent off-target effects using single-clone whole genome sequencing, which revealed that no significant fold change of guide-independent A-to-G DNA mutations occurred in edited cells compared to unedited controls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further, whole transcriptome sequencing and somatic variant calling showed no guide-independent RNA deamination in CD34+ HSPCs edited at a supra-saturating dose of BEAM-101.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Together, the findings support precision editing with BEAM-101 with a very low risk for potential off-target toxicities.

 BEAM-102: Direct correction of the sickle cell mutation 
 Our second base editing approach for sickle cell disease, BEAM-102, is a direct correction of the causative sickle mutation at position 6 of the beta globin gene. By making a single A-to-G edit, we have demonstrated in primary human CD34+ cells isolated from sickle cell disease patients the ability to create the naturally occurring Makassar variant of hemoglobin. This variant, which was identified in humans and first published in 1970, has the same function as the wild-type variant and does not cause sickle cell disease. Distinct from other approaches, cells that are successfully edited in this way are fully corrected, no longer containing the sickle protein. 
 BEAM-102 uses ex vivo delivery of our ABEs to edit CD34+ HSPCs. In cells isolated from donors with sickle cell disease, we achieved greater than 80% correction of the sickle point mutation to the HbG-Makassar variant, following in vitro erythroid differentiation. Importantly, we observed a simultaneous reduction of HbS to less than 20% of control levels, a level that is lower that that typically observed in sickle trait individuals, who are asymptomatic. More than 70% of erythroid colonies derived from edited patient cells showed biallelic editing (yielding cells that are potentially cured, no longer producing any sickle protein at all), and another 20% of cells had monoallelic editing (with one sickle allele and one corrected allele, conferring a level of protection expected to be similar to patients with “sickle cell trait” who do not show significant symptoms of disease) – adding up to 93% of cells with potential elimination of sickle cell disease. Further, the correction of the HbS protein to the HbG-Makassar variant was shown to significantly reduce the propensity of in vitro differentiated erythroid cells to sickle when subjected to hypoxia. These findings represent therapeutic levels of correction if translated into the clinic and support advancement of this program to potentially address the underlying genetic cause of sickle cell disease. Published modeling studies suggest that at least 20% of cells no longer having the propensity to sickle, either by expressing HbF or because of the elimination of HbS, may be sufficient to cure the disease. With upregulation levels of more than 60% of gamma globin for Beam-101 or by generating more than 90% of cells having at least one HbS allele corrected in the case of BEAM-102, we have shown, in preclinical models, correction levels significantly above those expected to be disease modifying.
 Long-term in vivo data generated using an early version of the Makassar base editor, yielded approximately 50% conversion of the sickle allele to a Makassar allele. At 16 weeks post-transplant of CD34+ cells containing the sickle trait, we observed equivalent human chimerism between unedited and edited cells and evidence of multi-lineage reconstitution in mouse models. Levels of editing were sustained after long-term hematopoietic engraftment. Further, editing of the sickle allele led to the expression of the Makassar globin protein in vivo.
 Ex vivo electroporation for multiplex editing: CAR-T cell therapies 
 The starting material for our multiplex allogeneic CAR-T cell products is white blood cells from a healthy donor, which are collected using a standard blood bank procedure known as leukapheresis. Using a single electroporation, we introduce the base editor as mRNA, and the guides encoding the target sequences. The edited cells are subsequently transduced with a lentivirus expressing the CAR.  Once the T cells have been engineered, they are expanded and frozen. After the patient is lymphodepleted, the multiplexed, allogenic cell product is infused.
 12


We believe base editing is a powerful tool to simultaneously multiplex edit many genes without unintended on-target effects, such as genomic rearrangements or activation of the p53 pathway, that can result from simultaneous editing with nucleases through the creation of double-stranded breaks. The ability to create a large number of multiplex edits in T cells could endow CAR-T cells and other cell therapies with combinations of features that may dramatically enhance their therapeutic potential in treating hematological or solid tumors. The initial indications that we plan to target with these product candidates are relapsed, refractory, T-ALL, and Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or AML. We believe that our approach has the potential to produce higher response rates and deeper remissions than existing approaches. Our proof-of-concept pre-clinical experiments have demonstrated the ability of base editors to efficiently modify up to 8 genomic loci simultaneously in primary human T cells with efficiencies ranging from 85-95% as measured by flow cytometry of target protein knockdown. Importantly, these results are achieved without the generation of chromosomal rearrangements, as detected by sensitive methods such as UDiTaSTM or G-banded Karyotyping and with no loss of cell viability from editing. The proof-of-concept experiments have also demonstrated robust T cell killing of target tumor cells both in vitro and  in vivo.
 BEAM-201: Universal CD7-targeting CAR-T cells
 BEAM-201 is a development candidate comprising T cells derived from healthy donors that are simultaneously edited at TRAC, CD7, CD52 and PDCD1 and then transduced with a lentivirus encoding for an anti-CD7 CAR to create allogenic CD7 targeting CAR-T cells, resistant to both fratricide and immunosuppression. To our knowledge, Beam-201 is the first cell therapy featuring four simultaneous edits. Using our cytosine base editor, or CBE, cells are edited to confer the following benefits:
  
• | TRAC: Prevent graft-vs-host disease via the elimination of the existing TCR to ensure that the CAR-T cell only attacks the CAR antigen on the tumor and not the patient’s healthy cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CD52: Enable an allogeneic cell source by masking BEAM-201 cells to anti-CD52 lymphodepleting agents to reduce host rejection of BEAM-201 cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PDCD1: Minimize immunosuppression of BEAM-201 cells by the tumor microenvironment and prolong efficacy for attacking the tumor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CD7: Prevent fratricide (i.e., CAR-T cells attacking each other before they can attack the tumor) by eliminating antigens that are shared between malignant cells and CAR-T cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In vitro characterization of BEAM-201 and comparison to nuclease editing:
  
• | Simultaneous base editing at four target loci in primary human T cells using a clinical-scale process, produced 96-99% on-target editing of each of the four genes as measured by next-generation sequencing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simultaneous quad base editing of T cells resulted in no detected genomic rearrangements; Cas9 nuclease editing with the same four guide RNAs produced chromosomal aberrations in 22 of 100 cells evaluated in G-banded karyotyping.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multiplex base editing did not negatively affect cell expansion during manufacturing, while nuclease editing induced significant loss of cell expansion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CBE-edited cells decreased expression of the four target genes with minimal effect on other genes, including key members of the p53 pathway that are upregulated in response to DNA double-stranded breaks produced by multiplex editing with nucleases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further characterization of BEAM-201 in vitro and in a tumor mouse model:
  
• | The GMP-compliant, clinical-scale process resulted in final BEAM-201 CAR-T cell populations with on-target editing efficiencies between 96-99.9% at each of the four target loci, and 85% CAR-expressing cells. As a result, we estimate that 91% of cells are bi-allelically quad base edited and 77% of cells have all five genetic modifications. We believe this is the highest level and uniformity of CAR expression and simultaneous editing across four target sites reported at clinical scale to date.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BEAM-201 cells demonstrated robust in vitro CD7-dependent cytokine production, and rapid in vitro cytotoxicity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BEAM-201 cells also demonstrated dose-dependent clearance or control, across a 25-fold dose range, of an aggressive disseminated CCRF-CEM T-ALL tumor mouse model.

Non-viral delivery for liver diseases: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and glycogen storage disorder 1a 
 LNPs are a clinically validated technology for delivery of nucleic acid payloads to the liver. LNPs are multi-component particles that encapsulate the base editor mRNA and guide(s) and protect them from degradation while in an external environment, enabling the transient delivery of the base editor in vivo. Multiple third-party clinical trials have demonstrated the effective delivery of silencing RNA, or siRNAs, to the liver using LNPs. We have developed several proprietary LNP formulations. Because only one dose of a base editing therapy may be needed in a course of treatment, LNPs are a suitable delivery modality that we believe is unlikely to face complications seen with chronic use of LNPs, such as when delivering oligonucleotides or mRNA for gene therapy. All of the components of the LNP, as well as the mRNA encoding the base editor, are well-defined and can be made synthetically, providing the opportunity for scalable manufacturing. We are currently using a variety of cationic lipids from various sources to advance our programs for genetic liver diseases, which include Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, or Alpha-1, and GSDIa, also known as Von Gierke disease.
 Alpha-1 is a severe inherited genetic disorder that can cause progressive lung and liver disease. The most severe form of Alpha-1 arises when a patient has a point mutation in both copies of the SERPINA1 gene at amino acid 342 position (E342K, also known as the PiZ mutation or the “Z” allele). This point mutation causes Alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT, to misfold, accumulating inside liver cells rather than being secreted, resulting in very low levels (10%-15%) of circulating AAT. As a consequence, the lung is left unprotected from neutrophil elastase, resulting in progressive, destructive changes in the lung, such as emphysema, which can result in the need for lung transplants. The mutant AAT protein also accumulates in the liver, causing liver inflammation and cirrhosis, which can ultimately cause liver failure or cancer and require patients to undergo a liver transplant. It is estimated that approximately 60,000 individuals in the United States have two copies of the Z allele. There are currently no curative treatments for patients with Alpha-1. 
 With the high efficiency and precision of our base editors, we aim to utilize our ABEs to precisely correct the E342K point mutation back to the wild type sequence.
 For a recent study, we engineered novel ABEs and guide RNAs capable of correcting the PiZ mutation, and then used a proprietary non-viral lipid nanoparticle formulation to deliver the optimized reagents to the livers of a PiZ transgenic mouse model. This direct editing approach resulted in an average of 16.9% correction of beneficial alleles at seven days and 28.8% at three months. This significant increase over the period suggests that corrected hepatocytes may have a survival advantage relative to uncorrected cells. In addition, treated mice demonstrate decreased Alpha-1-antitrypsin-mediated globule burden within the liver and a durable, significant increase in serum AAT active protein at three months, approximately 4.9-fold higher than in controls at the end of the study, levels which we believe would be clinically relevant if achieved in patients. These data indicate the potential for base editing as a one-time therapy to treat both lung and liver manifestations of Alpha-1.
 GSDIa is an inborn disorder of glucose metabolism caused by mutations in the G6PC gene, which results in low blood glucose levels that can be fatal if patients do not adhere to a strict regimen of slow-release forms of glucose, administered every one to four hours (including overnight). There are no disease-modifying therapies available for patients with GSDIa.
 Our approach to treating patients with GSDIa is to apply base editing via LNP delivery to repair the two most prevalent mutations that cause the disease, R83C and Q347X. It is estimated that these two-point mutations account for 900 and 500 patients, respectively, in the United States, representing approximately 59% of all GSDIa patients in this country. Animal studies have shown that as little as 11% of normal G6Pase activity in liver cells is sufficient to restore fasting glucose; however, this level must be maintained in order to preserve glucose control and alleviate other serious, and potentially fatal, GSDIa sequelae.
 We have engineered novel ABEs that, in preclinical models, have achieved high levels of precise correction of the two most prevalent GSD1a mutations, R83C and Q347X, in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Correction of at least 11% is expected to be clinically relevant and potentially disease modifying for GSDIa patients.
 In vitro studies have shown up to 80% correction of the alleles in cells harboring the Q347X point mutation and approximately 60% of the alleles in cells harboring the R83C mutation. 
 Significant, potentially disease-modifying levels of in vivo correction of both mutations by ABEs was observed in the livers of two strains of transgenic mice, each carrying one of the two relevant G6PC mutations. Next-generation sequencing data from whole liver extracts reveals approximately 40% and 70% A-to-G correction of R83C and Q347X, respectively. These significant levels of mutation correction greatly surpass those expected to restore glucose homeostasis and functional studies are ongoing to correlate pathophysiology to the extent of mutation correction by base-editing. Further, these levels of in vivo correction for GSDIa by base-editing are achieved without creation of double-stranded breaks. In total, these data support base-editing technology as a promising approach for precise correction of two of the most prevalent causative mutations in GSDIa.

Viral delivery for ocular and CNS disorders: Stargardt disease
 AAV is a clinically validated technology that has been extensively used for gene delivery to a variety of tissues. AAV is a small, non-pathogenic virus that can be repurposed to carry a therapeutic payload, making it an suitable vector for delivery of gene editing therapies. Several clinical trials have been conducted or are in progress with different AAV variants for multiple diseases, including diseases of the eye, liver, muscle, lung and CNS. We have an option to in-license a variety of AAV variants that could be selected for optimal distribution to multiple organs. Because our DNA base editors are larger than the approximate 4.5kb packaging limit of AAV vectors, we use a novel split intein technology that is designed to deliver the base editor and guide RNA by co-infection with two viruses, where each virus contains approximately one half of the editor. 
 We are currently evaluating this technology to correct one of the most prevalent mutations in the ABCA4 gene causing Stargardt disease, a progressive macular degeneration. This mutation is known as the G1961E point mutation and approximately 5,500 individuals in the United States are affected. Disease modeling using tiny light stimuli through holes that are equivalent in size to a single photoreceptor cell, suggests that only 12%-20% of these cells are sufficient to preserve vision. We anticipate, therefore, that editing percentages in the range of 12%-20% of these cells would be disease-modifying, since each edited cell will be fully corrected and protected from the biochemical defect. 
 In a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19 cells) in which we have knocked in the ABCA4 G1961E point mutation, we have demonstrated the precise correction of approximately 75% of the disease alleles at 5 weeks after dual infection with the split AAV system.
 Our portfolio of precision gene editing technologies
 Building on the expertise of our academic founders and our innovative research culture, we plan to explore new and complementary technologies in base editing, gene editing, and genetic medicine over the long term to advance a broad portfolio across multiple delivery pipelines. As part of this strategy, we have licensed a portfolio of three additional complementary technologies – RNA base editing, Cas12b nuclease editing, and prime editing for certain fields. Combined with base editing, we have assembled a broad and versatile portfolio of next generation gene editing technologies for the potential treatment of many severe diseases.
 Our license agreement with the Broad Institute gives us access to RNA base editing technology, a two-part modular system using an RNA-directed CRISPR protein for targeting RNA strands and a deaminase for editing. This CRISPR protein, known as Cas13, is modified so that it cannot break the RNA strand, and is fused to a deaminase capable of making a single base edit at a specific target location within the RNA strand. This enables us to change protein expression, potentially correcting or altering the function of the resulting protein and correcting disease. Our RNA base editing technologies include the REPAIR™ system for A-to-I editing, as well as the RESCUE™ system for C-to-U editing. When delivered through a long-lasting viral vector, RNA base editing may provide a complementary approach to DNA base editing for permanent correction of gene expression. Additionally, RNA editing could potentially be beneficial in situations where a transient change is desirable, such as in regenerative medicine.
 Our Broad Institute license also gives us access to the Cas12b nuclease family, which provides several potential strategic advantages for our portfolio. First, the distinct PAM sequence and conformation of Cas12b allows us to create DNA base editors that can bind to different target sites in the genome, further expanding the range of sites that we can edit. Second, having a nuclease allows us to make “cut” edits, which may be appropriate for some applications that require a double stranded break, or to use the general gene targeting ability of Cas12b for other genome editing applications.
 We also have a license to technology referred to as “prime editing,” that is controlled by Prime Medicine, Inc. Prime editing may be able to achieve the “rewriting” of short sequences of DNA at a target location. Prime editing utilizes a CRISPR protein to target a mutation site in DNA and to nick a single strand of the target DNA. The guide RNA allows the CRISPR protein to recognize a DNA sequence that is complementary to the guide RNA and also carries a primer for reverse transcription and a replacement template. The reverse transcriptase copies the template sequence in the nicked site, installing the edit. As with base editing, prime editing does not cause double-stranded breaks in the target DNA, resulting in lower insertion and deletion, or indel, rates than gene editing technologies that rely on double stranded breaks.
 We have the exclusive right to develop prime editing technology for the creation or modification of any single base transition mutations, as well as for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Transition mutations (i.e., A-to-G, G-to-A, C-to-T, or T-to-C) are the largest single class of disease-associated genetic mutations and include all of our current targets for base editing programs.
 Leveraging our deep scientific expertise and significant ongoing investment in our platform, we also expect to develop insights into other innovative gene editing and delivery modalities. We believe that our delivery, manufacturing, and development capabilities could position us to effectively evaluate and rapidly develop such novel technologies and further extend our leadership in the field of genetic medicine.

Ex vivo electroporation for hematologic diseases and oncology 
 Boston Children’s Hospital
 In July 2020, we formed a strategic alliance with Boston Children’s Hospital. Under the terms of the agreement, we will sponsor research programs at Boston Children’s to facilitate development of disease-specific therapies using our proprietary base editing technology. Boston Children’s will also serve as a clinical site to advance bench-to-bedside translation of our pipeline across certain therapeutic areas of interest, including programs in sickle cell disease and pediatric leukemias and exploration of new programs targeting other diseases.
Magenta Therapeutics
 In June 2020, we announced a non-exclusive research and clinical collaboration agreement with Magenta Therapeutics to evaluate the potential utility of MGTA-117, Magenta’s novel targeted ADC for conditioning of patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia receiving our base editing therapies. Conditioning is a critical component necessary to prepare a patient’s body to receive the edited cells, which carry the corrected gene and must engraft in the patient’s bone marrow in order to be effective. Today’s conditioning regimens rely on nonspecific chemotherapy or radiation, which are associated with significant toxicities. MGTA-117 precisely targets only hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, sparing immune cells, and has shown high selectivity, potent efficacy, wide safety margins and broad tolerability in non-human primate models. MGTA-117 may be capable of clearing space in bone marrow to support long-term engraftment and rapid recovery in patients. Combining the precision of our base editing technology with the more targeted conditioning regimen enabled by MGTA-117 could further improve therapeutic outcomes for patients suffering from these severe diseases. We will be responsible for clinical trial costs related to development of our base editors when combined with MGTA-117, while Magenta will continue to be responsible for all other development costs of MGTA-117.
 Non-Viral delivery for liver diseases 
 Verve Therapeutics
 In April 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Verve, a company focused on developing genetic medicines to safely edit the genome of adults to permanently lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and thereby treat coronary heart disease. This collaboration allows us to fully realize the potential of base editing in treating cardiovascular diseases, an area outside of our core focus where the Verve team has significant, world-class expertise. Under the terms of the agreement, Verve received exclusive access to our base editing technology, gene editing, and delivery technologies for human therapeutic applications against certain cardiovascular targets. In exchange, we received 2,556,322 shares of Verve common stock. Additionally, we will receive milestone payments for certain clinical and regulatory events and we retain the option, after the completion of Phase 1 studies, to participate in future development and commercialization, and share 50 percent of U.S. profits and losses, for any product directed against these targets. Verve granted to us a non-exclusive license under know-how and patents controlled by Verve, and an interest in joint collaboration technology. Either party may owe the other party other milestone payments for certain clinical and regulatory events related to the delivery technology products. Royalty payments may become due by either party to the other based on the net sales of any commercialized delivery technology products under the agreement.
 In June 2020, Verve reported preclinical proof-of-concept data in non-human primates that demonstrated the successful use of adenine base editors to turn off a gene in the liver. Utilizing ABE technology licensed from us and an optimized guide RNA packaged in an engineered lipid nanoparticle, Verve evaluated in vivo liver base editing to turn off proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a gene whose protein product elevates blood LDL cholesterol or angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), a gene whose protein product elevates blood triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We believe these proof-of-concept data, which show we can safely edit the primate genome, represent the first successful application of the base editing technology in non-human primates.
 In two separate studies, seven animals were treated with the drug product targeting the PCSK9 gene and seven additional animals with the drug product targeting the ANGPTL3 gene. Whole liver editing, blood protein and lipid levels were measured at two weeks and compared to baseline. The program targeting PCSK9 showed an average of 67% whole liver PCSK9 editing, which translated into an 89% reduction in plasma PCSK9 protein and resulted in a 59% reduction in blood LDL cholesterol levels. The program targeting ANGPTL3 showed an average of 60% whole liver ANGPTL3 editing, which translated into a 95% reduction in plasma ANGPTL3 protein and resulted in a 64% reduction in blood triglyceride levels and 19% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. In addition, in studies in primary human hepatocytes, clear evidence of on-target editing was observed with no evidence of off-target editing.
 Per the terms of our agreement with Verve, we can exercise our right to participate in the future development and commercialization of any programs at the completion of Phase 1 studies.

Viral delivery for ophthalmology and CNS diseases 
 Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel
 In July 2020, we announced a research collaboration with the Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel, or IOB. Founded in 2018 by a consortium that includes Novartis, the University Hospital of Basel and the University of Basel, IOB is a leader in basic and translational research aimed at treating impaired vision and blindness. Clinical scientists at IOB have also helped to develop better ways to measure how vision is impacted by Stargardt disease. Additionally, researchers at IOB have developed living models of the retina, known as organoids, which can be used to test novel therapies. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will leverage IOB’s unique expertise in the field of ophthalmology along with our novel base editing technology to advance programs directed to the treatment of certain ocular diseases, including Stargardt disease.
Manufacturing
 To realize the full potential of base editors as a new class of medicines and to enable our parallel investment strategy in multiple delivery modalities, we are building customized and integrated capabilities across discovery, manufacturing, and preclinical and clinical development. Due to the critical importance of high-quality manufacturing and control of production timing and know-how, we have taken steps toward establishing our own manufacturing facility, which will provide us the flexibility to manufacture numerous different drug product modalities. We believe this investment will maximize the value of our portfolio and capabilities, the probability of technical success of our programs, and the speed at which we can provide life-long cures to patients. 
 In August 2020, we entered into a lease agreement with Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. to build a 100,000 square foot current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, compliant manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina intended to support a broad range of clinical programs. We will anticipate investing up to $83.0 million over a five-year period and anticipate that the facility will be operational by the first quarter of 2023. The project will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant approved by the North Carolina Economic Investment Committee, which authorizes potential reimbursements based on new tax revenues generated through the project. The facility will be designed to support manufacturing for our ex vivo cell therapy programs in hematology and oncology and in vivo non-viral delivery programs for liver diseases, with flexibility to support manufacturing of our viral delivery programs, and ultimately, scale-up to support potential commercial supply. 
 For our initial waves of clinical programs, we will use contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, with relevant manufacturing experience in genetic medicines.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including the gene therapy and gene editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our differentiated technology, scientific expertise, and intellectual property position provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from a variety of companies in these fields. Within these industries, we will compete with existing large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies.
 There are several other companies utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease technology, including Caribou Biosciences, Editas Medicine, CRISPR Therapeutics, and Intellia Therapeutics. Several additional companies utilize other nuclease-based genome editing technologies, including Zinc Fingers, Arcuses, and TAL Nucleases, including Sangamo Biosciences, Precision BioSciences, bluebird bio, Allogene Therapeutics, and Cellectis. Additionally, newer genome editing modalities are emerging, including Prime Medicine, Tessera, Shape Therapeutics, and PerkinElmer (formerly Horizon Discovery), which is developing base editing technology. In addition, we face competition from companies utilizing gene therapy, oligonucleotides, and CAR-T therapeutic approaches.
 We are also aware of companies with products in development in our disease areas where we will compete with approved therapies, those in development today, and those emerging in the future.  For hemoglobinopathies, these companies include Global Blood Therapeutics, CRISPR Therapeutics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Sangamo Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Homology Medicines, Graphite Bio, and Trucode Gene Repair.  For T-cell malignancies, these include Gracell Bio, iCellGene, PersonGen, and Wugen.  More broadly in the immuno-oncology cell therapy space, these include Allogene Therapeutics, Cellectis, bluebird bio, Bristol Myers Squibb, Fate Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision Bio, Legend Bio, Autolus Therapeutics. For our liver targeted therapies, these include Intellia Therapeutics, Editas Medicines, CRISPR Therapeutics, Ultragenyx, Apic Bio, Arrowhead, LogicBio, Generation Bio, and Vertex.
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future that are approved to treat the same diseases for which we may obtain approval for our product candidates. This may include other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody, and/or protein therapies.
 17


In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and approved products than we do today. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting, hiring and retaining qualified scientific and management talent, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, obtaining manufacturing slots at contract manufacturing organizations, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, particularly if they represent cures, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement.
 COVID-19
 With the ongoing concern related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained and expanded the business continuity plans to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In March 2020, to protect the health of our employees, and their families and communities, we restricted access to our offices to personnel who performed critical activities that must be completed on-site, limited the number of such personnel that can be present at our facilities at any one time, and requested that most of our employees work remotely. In May 2020, as certain states eased restrictions, we established new protocols to better allow our full laboratory staff access to our facilities. These protocols included several shifts working over a seven-day-week protocol. We expect to continue incurring additional costs to ensure we adhere to the guidelines instituted by the CDC and to provide a safe working environment to our onsite employees.
 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, our corporate development objectives, results of operations and financial condition, including and the value of and market for our common stock, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease. Disruptions to the global economy, disruption of global healthcare systems, and other significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 While the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly impact our business or results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020, the length and extent of the pandemic, its consequences, and containment efforts will determine the future impact on our operations and financial condition.
 Intellectual property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our platform technology, our programs, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, exclusively licensing and filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our platform technology, existing and planned programs, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1A., Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 We also have an option to license patents and patent applications relating to CRISPR/Cas9 systems. We intend to continue to pursue, when possible, additional patent protection, including composition of matter, method of use, and process claims, directed to each component of our platform technology and the programs in our portfolio. We also intend to obtain rights to delivery modalities through one or more licenses from third parties and to protect our own intellectual property to delivery modalities. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, six pending U.S. patent applications, 25 pending international patent applications, or PCT applications, and 33 pending ex-U.S. patent applications. The patent applications outside of the United States were filed in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, and South Africa. Our owned patent applications are related to our DNA base editing technology, including claims to base editor variants with enhanced activities (e.g., nucleobase deaminating activity) or novel properties (e.g., PAM recognition), methods of using such base editors, methods of using such base editors for therapeutic indications, multiplex base editing in immune cells ex vivo, guide RNAs that target base editors to therapeutically relevant DNA sequences, and methods for evaluating base editing specificity. One of these PCT applications is co-owned with Broad Institute and President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard. If issued as U.S. patents, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patents would be expected to expire between 2039 and 2042, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. 
 DNA base editing 
 As of December 31, 2020, we in-licensed approximately 24 U.S. patents, 23 pending U.S. patent applications, three pending PCT applications, 43 ex-U.S. patents, and 149 pending ex-U.S. patent applications, related to DNA base editing from Broad Institute, Harvard, Editas Medicine Inc., or Editas, and Bio Palette Co., Ltd., or Bio Palette.

The in-licensed patents and applications also cover various aspects related to the platform technology, including base editing systems that employ S. pyogenes Cas9, S. aureus Cas9, Cas9 PAM variants, inactive forms of Cas9, and/or Cas9 nickases, and systems for delivery of base editors. Our current in-licensed patents and patent applications on DNA base editing, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions (or the corresponding foreign equivalent). 
 RNA Base Editing 
 As of December 31, 2020, we in-licensed approximately 10 pending U.S. patent applications, one ex-U.S. patent, and 47 pending ex-U.S. patent applications, related to RNA base editing from Broad Institute. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States were filed in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Russia. The patents and applications from our in-licensed portfolio for RNA base editing include claims to novel base editors, compositions including the base editor as a component, guide RNAs that target base editors to therapeutically relevant RNA sequences, and methods of using such base editors, including methods of using such base editors for therapeutic indications. Our current in-licensed patents and patent applications on RNA base editing, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2036 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions (or the corresponding foreign equivalent). 
 CRISPR/Cas12b 
 As of December 31, 2020, we in-licensed approximately seven pending U.S. patent applications, and eight pending ex-U.S. patent applications, related to editing using Cas12b from Broad Institute. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States were filed in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Russia. The patents and applications from our in-licensed portfolio for Cas12b editing include claims to methods of using Cas12b to modify DNA (e.g., nuclease cleavage of DNA) and engineered and/or non-naturally occurring compositions including Cas12b as a component. Our current in-licensed patents and patent applications on Cas12b base editing, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2036 and 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions (or the corresponding foreign equivalent). 
 19


Rest of platform 
 As of December 31, 2020, we in-licensed approximately 22 U.S. patents, 28 pending U.S. patent applications, 44 ex-U.S. patents, and 159 pending ex-U.S. patent applications, related to the balance of our platform from universities and institutions. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States were filed primarily in Europe, Japan, and China, although some of our in-licensed patent families were filed in a larger number of countries. The patents and applications from our in-licensed portfolio for the balance of our platform include claims to compositions and methods for delivery of charged base editor proteins into cells, modification and improvements to the base editing systems including improvements to the nucleotide binding protein component, guide RNA component and base editing enzyme component of the base editing complex, methods for evaluating gene targeting and base editing efficiency and compositions and methods for prime editing. Our current in-licensed patents and patent applications on the balance of our platform, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2034 and 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions (or the corresponding foreign equivalent). 
 CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas12a 
 We have a nonexclusive license to conduct research activities and an option to exclusively license certain patents and patent applications directed to Cas9 and Cas12a from Editas, who in turn has licensed such patents from various academic institutions. In the case of Cas9, a number of the U.S. patents are subject to an interference declared by the Patent and Trademark office, and a number of the European patents are the subject of one or more oppositions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1., Business—Intellectual property—Intellectual property licenses and Item 1A., Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, or PTA, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened (e.g., if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an earlier expiration date). In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. Patent term extensions, or PTE, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, are also possible for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the PTE is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug, a method for using it, or a method of manufacturing it, may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our products receive regulatory approval, we may be eligible to apply for PTEs on patents covering such products, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such PTE should be granted, and if granted, the length of such PTE. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1A., Risk factors—Risks related to our Intellectual property, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have implemented measures to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1A., Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Trademarks 
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned two registered U.S. trademarks with the Patent and Trademark Office for BEAM THERAPEUTICS, six ex-U.S. registered trademarks, and 21 ex-U.S. pending trademark applications for BEAM THERAPEUTICS. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we in-licensed two registered U.S. trademarks, approximately 10 allowed/registered ex-U.S. trademarks, and approximately eight pending ex-U.S. trademark applications, for the use of REPAIR™ and RESCUE™ from Broad Institute.

Intellectual property licenses 
 We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property from third parties. The licensed intellectual property covers, in part, CRISPR-related compositions of matter and their use for base editing. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We consider the following license agreements to be material to our business. 
Collaborations 
 We believe our base editing technology has potential across a broad array of genetic diseases. To fully realize this potential, we have established and will continue to seek out innovative collaborations, licenses, and strategic alliances with pioneering companies and with leading academic and research institutions. Additionally, we have and will continue to pursue relationships that potentially allow us to accelerate our preclinical research and development efforts. These relationships will allow us to aggressively pursue our vision of maximizing the potential of base editing to provide life-long cures for patients suffering from serious diseases.
License Agreement with The President and Fellows of Harvard College 
 In June 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Harvard, as amended, pursuant to which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by Harvard to make, have made, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import products in the field of the prevention or treatment of any and all human diseases and conditions, excluding human germline modification and products for non-human animal and plant applications. We refer to this license agreement as the Harvard License Agreement. 
 The licensed patents are directed, among other things, to C-to-T, A-to-G, and C-to-G base editors, for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions and to base editing, more generally. 
 Under the Harvard License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop products incorporating the base editing technology covered in the licensed patents, in accordance with a development plan that we prepared and submitted to Harvard. The development plan includes certain development milestones that we are required to meet, as well as the timelines for the completion thereof, and we may update the development plan from time to time in our discretion to better position us to meet such milestones. If we are successfully able to gain regulatory approval in any country to introduce a licensed product into the commercial market in such country, then we are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such licensed product and make such licensed product reasonably available to the public. If we fail to meet any of the deadlines for the development milestones, then Harvard may terminate the Harvard License Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and opportunities for us to cure such failure. Additionally, we are required to initiate a discovery program in accordance with the development plan and development milestones for the development of a licensed product covered by certain sub-categories of licensed patents. 
 The licenses granted to us under the Harvard License Agreement are expressly subject to certain preexisting rights held by Harvard and certain third parties. For example, certain of the licensed patents were developed by employees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and were subsequently assigned to Harvard but remain subject to a non-exclusive license between Harvard and Howard Hughes, pursuant to which Howard Hughes received a license from Harvard under certain of the licensed patents for research purposes with the right to sublicense to non-profit and governmental entities. In addition, certain of the licensed patents claim or cover inventions resulting from research that was sponsored by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government retains certain rights with respect to such licensed patents under applicable U.S. law. Harvard additionally retains limited rights for itself and for other non-profit research organizations to practice the licensed patents for research, educational, and scholarly purposes. Furthermore, Harvard retains the right, beginning a certain period of time after regulatory approval of any licensed product in the U.S. or certain European countries, to grant third parties the non-exclusive right to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, import, have imported, offer for sale, sell, have sold or otherwise distribute or have distributed such licensed product or an equivalent thereof solely for sale on a locally-affordable basis in certain specified developing countries in which the we do not have plans to seek regulatory approval. 
 Although the licenses granted to us under the Harvard License Agreement are exclusive, Harvard may grant a license to a third party under the licensed patents to research, develop, and commercialize a product directed to a particular target, or a proposed product, in the field under limited circumstances. If a third party that is not a specified competitor of ours inquires with Harvard for such a license, attempts to enter into a sublicense agreement with us and fails to do so after a certain period of time and presents to Harvard a proposal including certain information describing the proposed development and commercialization of such a proposed product, then Harvard may notify us of such proposal. If we are not researching, developing or commercializing such a proposed product, then we can notify Harvard as to whether we are interested in developing such proposed product, entering into a sublicense agreement with such third party to develop such proposed product, or entering into a sublicense with another third party to develop the same proposed product. If we inform Harvard that we are interested in developing such proposed product, then we will prepare a development plan, similar in scope to the development plan under the Harvard License Agreement, to develop such proposed product. If we inform Harvard that we are interested in entering into a sublicense agreement pursuant to which a third party would receive a sublicense from us under the licensed patents to develop such proposed product, then we will have a specified period of time to enter into such a sublicense agreement and provide reasonable evidence thereof. If we are not researching, developing, or commercializing such a 
 21


proposed product, fail to provide a development plan, or fail to enter into a sublicense agreement with respect to such proposed product, in each case, within specified time periods, then Harvard may grant a license to the applicable third party under the licensed patents to research, develop, and commercialize such proposed product. 
 We are permitted to further sublicense our rights under the Harvard License Agreement to third parties, provided that any such sublicense agreement with a third party must remain in compliance with and be consistent with the terms of the Harvard License Agreement, and certain rights granted to us under the Harvard License Agreement can only be sublicensed to bona fide collaboration partners who are working with us to develop one or more licensed products. In addition, any such sublicense agreement must include certain customary provisions to ensure our ability to comply with the Harvard License Agreement. We are also responsible for any breaches of a sublicense agreement by the applicable sublicensee, if such breach results in a material breach of the Harvard License Agreement. 
 In exchange for the licenses granted to us under the Harvard License Agreement, we initially issued to Harvard 101,363 shares of our common stock and subsequently issued 765,549 shares of our common stock pursuant to anti-dilution rights in the Harvard License Agreement. We are also required to pay to Harvard an annual license maintenance fee ranging from low-to-mid five figures to low six figures, depending on the particular calendar year. Harvard is also entitled to receive potential clinical and regulatory milestones in the mid-to-high eight figure range, subject to our receipt of regulatory approval in the United States, Japan and the European Union, or EU. If we undergo a change of control during the term of the Harvard License Agreement, then certain of the milestone payments would be increased. We paid Harvard a total of $9.0 million upon the completion of our Series A and Series B financings. We may additionally owe Harvard success payments ranging from $5.0 million to a maximum total of $105.0 million. 
 With respect to the sale of licensed products by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, Harvard is entitled to receive low single digit royalties on net sales of licensed products until, on a country-by-country basis, the latest of the expiration of (i) the last to expire licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product, (ii) the period of exclusivity associated with such licensed product in such country or (iii) a certain number of years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We are entitled to certain reductions and offsets on these royalties with respect to a licensed product in a given country and certain increases in the event we, our affiliates or sublicensees bring patent challenges relating to any licensed patents (subject to a cure period for us to terminate the sublicense that has taken the applicable action). If we sublicense our rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product under the Harvard License Agreement to a third party and we receive non-royalty sublicense income, then Harvard is entitled to a percentage of such consideration, ranging from the high single digits to an amount between 10% and 20% depending on the date in which such sublicense agreement is executed and the stage of development our licensed products at such time. 
 Harvard is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of all licensed patents, provided that we have customary consultation, comment, and review rights with respect to such prosecution and maintenance activities. We are responsible for Harvard’s documented out-of-pocket expenses with respect to such prosecution and maintenance, but if Harvard enters into a license agreement with a third party pursuant to which it grants such third party a license under the licensed patents outside of our field, then Harvard must use reasonable efforts to include a provision in such agreement that provides for an apportionment of prosecution and maintenance costs between us and such third party with respect to such licensed patents. If we choose to no longer pay for the prosecution and maintenance costs of a given licensed patent, then we will be relieved of such payment obligation, but our license with respect to such licensed patent will also terminate. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Harvard License Agreement will remain in effect until the later of the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering our licensed products or the end of the last to expire royalty term. We may terminate the Harvard License Agreement at our convenience following written notice to Harvard. Either party may terminate the Harvard License Agreement for a material breach of the other party, subject to a notice and cure period. Harvard may also terminate the Harvard License Agreement in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we fail to procure and maintain insurance. Upon expiration or termination of the Harvard License Agreement, the licenses granted to us will terminate and all rights under the licensed patent rights will revert to Harvard. 
 License Agreement with Editas Medicine, Inc. 
 In May 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Editas pursuant to which we received an exclusive (even as to Editas), royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by Editas related to certain base editing technologies and CRISPR technology to develop, commercialize, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import base editing products for the treatment of human diseases or conditions. We refer to this license agreement as the Editas License Agreement. The license we received is non-exclusive with respect to certain specified targets. Our licensed field excludes the treatment of certain diseases and certain fields of use that have already been licensed to other partners of Editas, provided that our licensed field may expand if the fields licensed to other Editas partners are reduced or are otherwise modified as a result of any termination, expiration, or amendment to Editas’ agreements with such partners. In addition, we received a royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license under a separate set of patent rights owned or controlled by Editas to conduct research activities in our licensed field and for which we have an option to obtain an exclusive license from Editas. 
 22


Certain of the patents licensed to us under the Editas License Agreement were licensed to Editas from Broad Institute and Harvard and certain of the patents for which we have an option to obtain a license were licensed to Editas from the Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH. Accordingly, the licenses granted to us under the Editas License Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in each of the license agreements concerning the licensed patents between Broad Institute, Harvard and Editas, or the Broad/Harvard Head Licenses, and each of the license agreements concerning the patents for which we have an option to obtain a license between MGH and Editas, or the MGH Head Licenses. 
 As described above, Editas granted us an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license under certain patents on a patent family-by-patent family basis. If we so exercise the option with respect to a patent family of such optioned patents, then we would receive an exclusive license to such patent family of the same scope as the other patents exclusively licensed to us under the Editas License Agreement. In order to exercise an option with respect to a patent family of these optioned patents we would pay an eight-figure option exercise fee, depending on the date in which particular option is exercised. 
 Under the Editas License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a licensed product in our licensed field in each of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, or U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain, including filing the first IND for a licensed product within a certain period of time following the execution of the Editas License Agreement. If we are successfully able to gain regulatory approval in any country for a licensed product, then we are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such licensed product in such country. We also have sole control and responsibility over all regulatory activities with respect to the development of licensed products. 
 We are permitted to further sublicense certain of our rights under the Editas License Agreement to third parties, provided that any such sublicense agreement with a third party must remain in compliance with and be consistent with the terms of the Editas License Agreement and the Broad/Harvard Head Licenses and MGH Head Licenses, as applicable. We are also responsible for any breaches of a sublicense agreement by the applicable sublicensee and are responsible for all payments due under the Editas License Agreement by operation of any such sublicense. Following the signing of the Editas License Agreement, we obtained the right to further sublicense our rights the licensed patents from Broad Institute and Harvard to third parties, provided that we comply with certain sublicensing requirements under each of the Broad/Harvard Head Licenses as if we were Editas, as well as certain other customary conditions. We have not obtained any such right from MGH allowing us to further sublicense our rights under the licensed patents from MGH to third parties and will require written consent in the event we wish to further sublicense such rights to a third party. 
 Upon the execution of the Editas License Agreement, we paid Editas an upfront fee of $180,000. We also issued to Editas 1,833,333 shares of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock and 1,222,222 shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock. In addition, if any of our commercial, regulatory, development or sales activities with respect to the licensed products triggers a milestone payment or sublicense income that Editas owes under the Broad/Harvard Head Licenses or the MGH Head Licenses, then we are required to pay Editas the full amount of such milestone payment or sublicense income, as applicable; provided that we will not pay Editas for any sublicense income due as a result of the upfront fee we paid to Editas, our issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock to Editas, or our payment of any option exercise fee to Editas. Aggregate milestone amounts under the Editas License Agreement could equal up to $68.8 million for each product developed and commercialized using rights related to certain base editing technologies and CRISPR technology; in the event we develop and commercialize products covered by claims from the additional patent families licensed or optioned to us under the Editas License Agreement, aggregate milestone payments could equal up to $74.0 million per product. The percentage of sublicense income we would owe under the Editas License Agreement ranges from none to amounts between 10% and 20%. In addition, we agreed to pay for a portion of the annual license maintenance fees and prosecution and maintenance costs that Editas incurs itself or owes under the Broad /Harvard Head Licenses and the MGH Head Licenses with respect to the licensed patents. The upfront fee, equity issuance, and option exercise payments we make to Editas under the Editas License Agreement constitute both consideration for the licenses granted to us under the Editas License Agreement and reimbursement for prosecution and maintenance costs for the licensed patents. 
 With respect to the sale of licensed products by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, we are required to pay to Editas an amount equal to the royalty rates that it owes to Broad Institute, Harvard, or MGH under its applicable in-licenses, plus an additional low- to mid-single digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, depending on whether such licensed product is covered by an Editas-owned patent and based on the aggregate worldwide net sales of licensed products in a given calendar year. We are entitled to certain reductions and offsets on these royalties with respect to a licensed product in a given country and if Editas is entitled to receive any reductions or offsets in respect to its royalty payment obligations under the relevant Broad/Harvard Head Licenses or MGH Head Licenses, then Editas will use reasonable efforts to avail itself of such reductions, which in turn would reduce our royalty payment obligations under the Editas License Agreement. The royalty term expires on licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the last-to-expire royalty term in such country under any applicable Broad/Harvard Head License or MGH Head License, and, if such product is covered by a licensed Editas-owned patent, (ii) the date at which such product is no longer covered by a valid claim of a licensed Editas-owned patent in such country. 
 Editas is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of all licensed patents, provided that we have certain information, comment, and review rights for certain of the licensed patents. 
 23


Unless earlier terminated, the Editas License Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the Editas License Agreement following written notice to Editas. Either party may terminate the Editas License Agreement for a material breach of the other party, subject to a notice and cure period. Editas may also terminate the Editas License Agreement if we challenge the validity of any of the licensed patents, subject to customary carveouts. Upon expiration or termination of the Editas License Agreement in its entirety or with respect to a family of patents, the licenses granted to us will immediately terminate in its entirety or solely with respect to the expired or terminated patent family, as the case may be; however, if we have the right to terminate the Editas License Agreement due to Editas’ material breach of the Editas License Agreement, then in lieu of so terminating the Editas License Agreement, we can elect to reduce our royalty payment obligations under the Editas License Agreement by certain specified percentages. 
 License Agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc. 
 In May 2018, our affiliate, Blink Therapeutics Inc., or Blink, entered into a license agreement, as amended, with Broad Institute. Under the Broad License Agreement, Blink is granted certain rights to RNA base editing technology, including the RNA editor platforms RESCUE™ and REPAIR™, which use Cas13 linked to a deaminase to deliver single base A-to-I or C-to-U editing of RNA transcripts, respectively, as well as the Cas12b nuclease family of gene editing enzymes. 
 More specifically, under the Broad License Agreement, Broad Institute granted Blink an exclusive license under certain patent rights to the extent owned or controlled by Broad Institute (including via an interinstitutional agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, and Harvard) comprising of (i) an exclusive license under certain patent rights claiming or disclosing novel CRISPR enzymes and systems (including those related to DNA cleaving) or systems, methods and compositions for targeted nucleic acid editing, in each case to exploit products covered by such patents, (ii) an exclusive license under certain product-specific patent rights claiming or disclosing novel CRISPR enzymes and systems, methods and compositions for targeted nucleic acid editing, in each case to exploit base editor products covered by such patents and (iii) an exclusive license under certain patent rights generally related to gene targeting to exploit base editor products covered by such patents. 
 Under the Broad License Agreement, Blink has also been granted (i) a non-exclusive license under all patents exclusively licensed to Blink under the Broad License Agreement to exploit certain products in our field that were made, discovered, developed or determined to have utility through the use of such patents in a research or discovery program commencing before May 2021 or through the use of transferred materials from Broad Institute but that are not covered by the licensed patents and (ii) a non-exclusive internal research license under all patents exclusively licensed to Blink. All licenses granted to Blink by Broad Institute exclude human germline modification, the stimulation of biased inheritance of particular genes or, with certain exceptions, traits within a plant or animal population and certain modifications of the tobacco plant and are subject to certain retained rights of Broad Institute, Harvard and MIT and the U.S. federal government. Broad Institute additionally retains limited rights for itself, Harvard and MIT and for other non-profit research organizations to practice the licensed patents for research, educational, and scholarly purposes. 
 Under the Broad License Agreement, Blink is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with a development plan that Blink prepared and submitted to Broad Institute. The development plan includes certain development milestones that Blink is required to meet, as well as the timelines for the completion thereof, and Blink may update the development plan from time to time if Blink believes, in its good faith judgment, that such update is needed in order to improve Blink’s ability to meet such development milestones. Blink will not be able to delay such development milestone timelines without providing a reasonable explanation and plan to Broad Institute and provided further that Broad Institute’s approval of the explanation and plan in its reasonable discretion is required for any milestone timeline extension of more than a specified number of years. If Blink is successfully able to gain regulatory approval in any country to introduce a licensed product into the commercial market in such country, then Blink is also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such licensed product and make such licensed product reasonably available to the public. 
 Additionally, Blink is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the viability of the technology covered, claimed or disclosed in certain sub-categories of licensed patents and must initiate a discovery program for the development of a licensed product covered by a valid claim, or otherwise generally enabled, by the use of such sub-category of the licensed patents during a certain period of time following the execution of the Broad License Agreement and submit an updated development plan and development milestones reasonably acceptable to Broad Institute for such sub-category of the licensed patents within such period of time. If Blink fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the viability of such technology or to initiate a discovery program or to submit an updated development plan in the specified time period then the license under such sub-category of the licensed patents will terminate and, if such sub-category of the licensed patents consists of base editor patent rights, Blink’s rights with respect to gene targeting licensed patents shall convert to non-exclusive so that such rights may be licensed for use to such terminated base editor licensed patents. 
 Broad Institute, MIT, and Harvard also retain the right to grant further licenses under specified circumstances to third parties, other than specified entities, that wish to research, develop, and commercialize a product that would otherwise fall within the scope of our exclusive license grant from Broad Institute and Harvard pursuant to Broad Institute, Harvard and MIT’s inclusive innovation model. 
 24


If, after a specified period of time, such a third party inquires with Broad Institute for such a license and presents to Broad Institute a proposal including information describing the proposed development and commercialization of such a proposed product, then Broad Institute may notify Blink of the request and requester, and the nature of the specific proposed product. Broad Institute is not required to share any other information provided by the requester to Blink in connection with the inclusive innovation model. If Blink is not researching, developing or commercializing such a proposed product, then Blink can notify Broad Institute as to whether in good faith it is interested in developing such proposed product, entering into a sublicense agreement with such requesting third party to develop such proposed product, or entering into a sublicense with another third party to develop such proposed product. If Blink informs Broad Institute that it is interested in developing such proposed product, then Blink will prepare a development plan, similar in scope to the development plan under the Broad License Agreement, to develop such proposed product and must commence the development program for such proposed product within a specified period. If Blink informs Broad Institute that it is interested in entering into a sublicense agreement pursuant to which the inquiring third party or another third party would receive a sublicense from Blink under the licensed patents to develop such proposed product, then Blink may enter into such a sublicense agreement and provide reasonable evidence thereof during the period. If Blink declines to conduct the foregoing activities or does not complete such activities within the specified period, which period is reduced by the period of time the requesting third party has previously negotiated with Blink, then Broad Institute may grant a license to the applicable third party under the licensed patents to research, develop, and commercialize such proposed product. 
 Blink is permitted to sublicense the licensed patents to affiliates and third parties, provided that any such sublicense agreement must remain in compliance with and be consistent with the terms of the Broad License Agreement. In addition, any such sublicense agreement must include certain customary provisions to ensure Blink’s ability to comply with the Broad License Agreement. Blink is also responsible for any breaches of a sublicense agreement by the applicable sublicensee and is responsible for all payments due under the Broad License Agreement by operation of any such sublicense. 
 As partial consideration for the rights granted under the Broad License Agreement, Broad Institute received 1,940,000 shares of Blink’s common stock. The shares issued to Broad Institute were exchanged into 865,240 shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of Blink on September 25, 2018. 
 Under the Broad License Agreement, Blink is also required to pay Broad Institute an annual license maintenance fee ranging from the low- to mid-five figures to the low-six figures, depending on the particular calendar year. Broad Institute is also entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestones totaling in the mid-to-high eight figure range. We paid Broad Institute a total of $9.0 million upon the completion of our Series A and Series B financings. Blink may additionally owe Broad Institute success payments ranging from $5.0 million to a maximum total of $105.0 million. 
 Blink is also required to pay royalties in the low single digits for products covered by the licensed patents with such royalty reduced by a certain percentage for products enabled by the licensed patents, but not covered by the licensed patents. The royalty rate payable by Blink is subject to customary reductions and offsets on these royalties with respect to a product in a given country. The royalty term for a product in a country will terminate on the later of the expiration of (i) the last to expire licensed patent covering the applicable product, (ii) the period of exclusivity associated with such product in such country or (iii) a certain period of time after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. If Blink sublicenses its rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product under the Broad License Agreement to a third party and receives non-royalty sublicense income, then Broad Institute is entitled to a percentage of such consideration, ranging from the high single digits to an amount between 10% and 20%, dependent on the development stage of products under the Broad License Agreement at the time of sublicense execution. 
 Broad Institute is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of all licensed patents, provided that Blink has certain consultation, comment, and review rights with respect to such prosecution and maintenance activities of exclusively licensed patent rights. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Broad License Agreement will remain in effect until the later of the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering our licensed products or the end of the last to expire royalty term. Blink may terminate the Broad License Agreement for its convenience following written notice to Broad Institute. Either party may terminate the Broad License Agreement for a material breach of the other party, subject to a notice and cure period. Broad Institute may also terminate the Broad License Agreement in the event of Blink’s bankruptcy or insolvency, if Blink fails to procure and maintain insurance or if Blink, its affiliates or sublicensees bringing patent challenges relating to any licensed patents (subject to a cure period for Blink to terminate the sublicensee that has taken the applicable action). 
 License Agreement with Bio Palette Co., Ltd. 
 On March 27, 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Bio Palette Co., Ltd., or Bio Palette, pursuant to which we received an exclusive (even as to Bio Palette), sublicensable license under certain patent rights related to base editing owned or controlled by Bio Palette to exploit products for the treatment of human disease throughout the world, but excluding products in the microbiome field in Asia. We refer to this agreement as the Bio Palette License Agreement. In addition, we granted Bio Palette an exclusive (even as to Beam) license under certain patent rights related to base editing and gene editing owned or controlled by Beam to exploit products in the microbiome field in Asia. Each party to the agreement retains non-exclusive rights to develop and manufacture products in the 
 25


microbiome field worldwide for the sole purpose of exploiting those products in its own territory. Each party agrees to certain coordination obligations in the microbiome field in the event that either party determines not to exploit their rights in such field. 
 If Bio Palette comes into the control of any other patent right that is useful within a certain defined field and intends to grant a license under that patent right in certain defined fields in certain defined territories, we have the exclusive right of first negotiation for an exclusive license under that patent right in those fields and territories. If we come into the control of any other patent right that is useful in certain defined fields and intend to grant a license under that patent right in those fields in certain defined territories, Bio Palette has the exclusive right of first negotiation for an exclusive license under that patent right in those fields and territories. 
 As part of the agreement, if we form a Scientific Advisory Board, then Bio Palette will have the right to appoint two representatives to such board for a period of five years. Additionally, we and Bio Palette agree to communicate with each other regarding potential base editing collaborations in Japan. 
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a licensed product in the United States, Japan, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain. For any licensed product in our licensed field and territory that receives regulatory approval, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize that licensed product in the relevant country. Bio Palette is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a licensed product in Japan. For any licensed product in the microbiome field in Asia that receives regulatory approval, Bio Palette is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such licensed product in the relevant country. 
 Certain of the patents licensed to us under the Bio Palette License Agreement were licensed to Bio Palette from Kobe University under a license agreement we refer to as the Kobe Head License. Accordingly, the licenses granted to us under the Bio Palette License Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Kobe Head License, which include provisions providing for certain rights to be retained by third parties including governmental authorities. 
 We and Bio Palette are both permitted to sublicense the licensed patents to affiliates and third parties, provided that the applicable terms of the Bio Palette License Agreement and the applicable head licenses would apply to such affiliates and third parties. The sublicensing party is also responsible for any breaches of such terms by the applicable sublicensee and is responsible for all payments due under the Bio Palette License Agreement by operation of any such sublicense. 
 Upon the execution of the Bio Palette License Agreement, we paid Bio Palette an upfront fee of $0.5 million. In connection with the execution of the Bio Palette License Agreement, we issued to Bio Palette 16,725 shares of our common stock, with an agreement to issue additional shares of our common stock in the low six figures in the event that the referenced Bio Palette patent issues in the United States. Upon the issuance of a certain Bio Palette patent in the United States in June 2020, we made a milestone payment of $2.0 million and, in July 2020, issued to Bio Palette 175,000 shares of our common stock valued at $0.3 million. We also agreed to pay a royalty at a fraction of a percent on net sales of products that are covered by the patents licensed by Bio Palette to us, and Bio Palette agreed to pay a royalty at a fraction of a percent on net sales of products that are covered by the patents licensed by us to Bio Palette. The royalty term for a product in a country will terminate on the later of the expiration of (i) patent-based exclusivity with respect to such licensed product in such country or (ii) regulatory exclusivity with respect to such licensed product in such country. 
 Any intellectual property arising out of activities under the Bio Palette License Agreement will be owned by the party inventing such intellectual property. Bio Palette is responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of all patents licensed by Bio Palette to us, provided that we have customary consultation, comment and review rights with respect to such prosecution and maintenance activities solely with respect to national entries of a certain specified PCT application. We are responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of patents licensed by us to Bio Palette. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Bio Palette License Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term for each such licensed product and country. Each party has the right to terminate the Bio Palette License Agreement for convenience with respect to the license granted to such party subject to a specified notice period. Either party may terminate the Bio Palette License Agreement with respect to the license granted to the other party for a material breach by the other party, subject to a specified notice and cure period. Additionally, either party may also terminate the Bio Palette License Agreement in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency or if the other party, its affiliates or sublicensees brings a patent challenge relating to any licensed patents (but, in the case of such a patent challenge by a sublicensee, subject to a cure period for such party to terminate its agreement with the sublicensee that has taken the applicable action). 
 Government regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, reimbursement, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant for marketing approval to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions. 
 26


The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions and compliance with applicable statutes and regulatory requirements, both pre- and post-approval, and obtaining reimbursement status will continue to require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug and biological product development, approval, and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. We cannot predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or if regulatory authorities’ guidance or interpretations will change. 
 Licensure and regulation of biologics in the United States 
 In the United States, our candidate products are regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the implementing regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps: 
  
• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, requesting marketing of the biological product for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labelling;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the BLA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements; to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice, or cGTP, requirements for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLPs and GCPs and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of the application fee under the Prescription Drug User Free Act, or PDUFA, unless exempted; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA, which may be subject to additional post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies and investigational new drug application 
 Before testing any investigational biological product in humans, including a gene editing product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including applicable Good Laboratory Practices requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug or biological product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial. The IND seeks FDA authorization to test the drug or biological product candidate in humans and automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted. 
 27


FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. 
 Expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use 
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. 
 There is no requirement for a manufacturer to provide expanded access to an investigational product. However, if a manufacturer decides to make its investigational product available for expanded access, FDA reviews requests for expanded access and determines if treatment may proceed. Expanded access may be appropriate when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
 Under the FDCA, sponsors of one or more investigational products for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) must make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the investigational drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides an additional mechanism for patients with a life-threatening condition who have exhausted approved treatments and are unable to participate in clinical trials to access certain investigational products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial, are the subject of an active IND, and are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Unlike the expanded access framework described above, the Right to Try Pathway does not require FDA to review or approve requests for use of the investigational product. There is no obligation for a manufacturer to make its investigational products available to eligible patients under the Right to Try Act. 
 Human clinical trials in support of a BLA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of qualified principal investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation. Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements intended to ensure the protection of human subjects and the quality and integrity of the study data, including requirements for review and approval by an independent ethics committee and obtaining subjects’ informed consent. 
 For clinical trials conducted in the United States, an IND is required, and each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Clinical trials must also comply with extensive GCP rules and the requirements for obtaining subjects’ informed consent. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, including GCP, or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in 
 28


study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. Finally, research activities involving infectious agents, hazardous chemicals, recombinant DNA, and genetically altered organisms and agents may be subject to review and approval of an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, in accordance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval. 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical study sites to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety or effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. The FDA generally recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene-therapy related delayed adverse events in a long-term follow-up study of fifteen years for integrating vectors, up to fifteen years for herpes virus vectors capable of establishing latency, up to fifteen years for microbial vectors known to establish persistent infection, up to fifteen years for genome editing products, and up to five years for AAV vectors. FDA recommends that these long-term follow-up studies include, at a minimum, five years of annual physical examinations followed by annual queries, either in-person or by phone or written questionnaire, for the remaining observation period. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must submit a pediatric study plan to FDA outlining the proposed pediatric study or studies they plan to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The FDA must then review the information submitted, consult with the sponsor, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements, under specified circumstances. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information in clinical trial registries exist in the EU and in other countries outside the United States. 
 Special regulations and guidance governing gene therapy products 
 It is possible that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products and cell therapy products may be applied to any CRISPR/Cas9 product candidates we may develop, but that remains uncertain at this point. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that mediates its effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and which are administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or be transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. The Center for Biologics 
 29


Evaluation and Research, or CBER, at FDA regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the NIH, and the FDA and the NIH have published a number of guidance documents with respect to the development of gene therapy products. 
 Although the FDA’s guidance documents are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with certain aspects of them is likely necessary to gain approval for any product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide recommendations and additional clarity as to factors that the FDA will consider at each stage of gene therapy development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies; and gene therapy products for the treatment of rare diseases. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving any NIH funding for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, the trial must be conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules. Research conducted at such institutions that involves the transfer of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, into human subjects must undergo review and approval by an IBC before it commences. Many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. 
 Compliance with cGMP and cGTP requirements 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. Material changes in manufacturing equipment, location, or process post-approval, may result in additional regulatory review and approval. 
 For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. 
 Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. The manufacturing facilities may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements imposed when the product was approved, regulatory enforcement action may be taken, which may include a warning letter or an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and/or recall of products previously shipped. 
 Review and approval of a BLA 
 The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, information on the chemistry and composition of the biological product candidate, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2020 is $2,942,965 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2020 is $325,424. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
 The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review application. A major amendment to a BLA submitted at any time during the review cycle, including in response to a request from the FDA, may extend the goal date by three months. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. 
 30


During its review of a BLA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions about a BLA. 
 Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent and that the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent. 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific labeling for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under PDUFA as either Class 1 or Class 2. The classification of a resubmission is based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s safety or efficacy after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review and regenerative advanced therapy designations 
 The FDA has several programs designed to expedite the development and approval of drugs and biological products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, and regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation. These designations are not mutually exclusive, and a product candidate may qualify for one or more of these programs. While these programs are intended to expedite product development and approval, they do not alter the standards for FDA approval. 
 The FDA may grant a product fast track designation if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s marketing application before the application is complete in some circumstances. Fast track designation may be rescinded if FDA believes that the product no longer meets the qualifying criteria. 
 A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to aid sponsors in designing the clinical trials in an efficient manner. Breakthrough designation may be rescinded if a product no longer meets the qualifying criteria. 
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized an additional expedited program for regenerative medicine advanced therapies. A product is eligible for RMAT designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of RMAT designation include the benefits available to breakthrough therapies, including potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. RMAT designation may be rescinded if a product no longer meets the qualifying criteria. 
 31


FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of such condition. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and it shortens the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 Accelerated approval pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 For drugs granted accelerated approval, FDA generally requires sponsors to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, failure to confirm a clinical benefit during the post-approval studies, or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product approval on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval are subject to prior review by the FDA unless FDA informs the applicant otherwise. 
 Post-approval regulation 
 Upon FDA approval of a BLA, the sponsor must comply with extensive post-approval regulatory requirements applicable to biological products, including any additional post-approval requirements that the FDA may impose as part of the approval process. These post-approval requirements include, among other things: 
  
• | record keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of certain adverse experiences with the product and production problems to the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug sampling and distribution requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | notifying FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing and labeling changes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with requirements concerning advertising, promotional labeling, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and other promotional activities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced regulatory inspections for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP and pharmacovigilance regulations. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 The FDA strictly regulates the advertising and labeling of prescription drug products, including biological products. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. In addition, the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
 After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or dosing regimens, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 32


The FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or issues with manufacturing processes, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety signals; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product recall, seizure, or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 Orphan drug designation 
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for certain tax credits. In addition, if a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following product approval unless the subsequent product candidate is demonstrated to be clinically superior. Absent a showing of clinical superiority, FDA cannot approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities. 
 A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. To qualify for orphan exclusivity, however, the drug must be clinically superior to the previously approved product that is the same drug for the same condition. 
 Gene therapy products present novel issues for assessing when two products are the “same” for orphan exclusivity purposes. On January 28. 2020, the FDA issued a non-binding draft guidance document describing its current thinking on when a gene therapy product is the “same” as another product for purposes of orphan exclusivity. Under the draft guidance, if either the transgene or vector differs between two gene therapy products in a manner that does not reflect “minor” differences, the two products would be considered different drugs for orphan drug exclusivity purposes. FDA will determine whether two vectors from the same viral class are the same on a case-by-case basis and may consider additional key features in assessing sameness. While the guidance provides some additional clarity on FDA’s approach to assessing “sameness,” significant ambiguity and uncertainty remain as to how FDA will assess viral vectors in the same class, what differences in vector or transgene are considered minor, and what additional features may be considered.
 Pediatric exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent regulatory exclusivity in the United States. Specifically, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for the attachment of an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to the term of any remaining regulatory exclusivity or patent periods at the time the pediatric exclusivity is granted. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data, even if the data do not show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. 
 Biosimilars and exclusivity 
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. 
 33


Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biological product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. This 12-year exclusivity period is referred to as the reference product exclusivity period and bars approval of a biosimilar but notably does not prevent approval of a competing product pursuant to a full BLA (i.e., containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the product). The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. 
 There have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as judicial challenges seeking to repeal, modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the ACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if those efforts continue and if the ACA is repealed, substantially modified, or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation. 
 Patent term restoration and extension 
 A patent claiming a new biological product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of a marketing application less any dime during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date less any dime during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
 FDA approval of companion diagnostics 
 In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs; for federal fiscal year 2021, the standard fee for review of a PMA is $365,657 and the small business fee is $91,414. 
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for 
 34


obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Many companion diagnostics are considered significant risk devices due to their role in diagnosing a disease or condition. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 California Consumer Privacy Act 
 In 2018, California passed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposed many requirements on businesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA’s requirements are similar to those found in the GDPR, including requiring businesses to provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such information is used and shared, and providing data subjects the right to request access to such personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such personal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of “sales” of their personal information. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements. It also provides California residents a private right of action, including the ability to seek statutory damages, in the event of a breach involving their personal information. Compliance with the CCPA is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. On November 3, 2020, California voters passed a ballot initiative for the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will significantly expand the CCPA to incorporate additional GDPR-like provisions including requiring that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information.  The CPRA will also expand personal information rights of California residents, including creating a right to opt out of sharing of personal information with third parties for advertising, expanding the lookback period for the right to know about personal information held by businesses, and expanding the right to erasure for information held by third parties.  Most CPRA provisions will take effect on January 1, 2023, though the obligations will apply to any personal information collected after January 1, 2022.
 Regulation and procedures governing approval of medicinal products in the EU and the U.K.
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. 
 Marketing authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a gene therapy product under the EU regulatory system, an applicant must submit an application via the centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the EU for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA’s Committee for Advance Therapies which provides a draft opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization and which is subject to final approval by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of that final approval. 
 35


Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 In the EU, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. This also applies to biosimilars. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. In addition, if a pediatric investigation plan is accepted, then a further year of market exclusivity might be obtained (or in the alternative a patent extension (SPC) of a further 6 months). For orphan medicinal products, the periods are separate and different in that there is a total of 10-year data exclusivity and if they have a PIP, there is a further two-year extension to that 10-year period. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical or biological entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of authorization and renewals 
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 
 Regulatory requirements after marketing authorization 
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the EU, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. The marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended. 
 Clinical trial approval 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of each EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the local competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC six months after the clinical trial portal is announced by the European Commission to be ready for use. This new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU by allowing for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 Conditional marketing authorization 
 For medicinal products where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of less comprehensive data than normally required, based on the scope and criteria defined in legislation and guidelines, it is possible to obtain from the EMA a conditional marketing authorization with a 12 month validity period and annual renewal pursuant to Regulation No 507/2006. These are granted only if the CHMP finds that all four requirements are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive; (ii) it is likely that the 
 36


applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data; (iii) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled; and (iv) the benefit to public health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data. 
 PRIME designation in the EU 
 The EU has a Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme that is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. 
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Brexit and the regulatory framework in the U.K 
 The withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU occurred on January 31, 2020, which is commonly known as “Brexit.” A “transition period” through December 31, 2020 has been established to allow the U.K. and EU to negotiate the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal. 
 Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. relating to quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit will materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. In the first instance, a separate U.K. authorization from any centralized authorization for the EU would need to be applied before the end of any agreed transition period. In the immediately foreseeable future, the process is likely to remain very similar to that applicable in the EU, albeit that the processes for applications will be separate. Longer term, the U.K. is likely to develop its own legislation that diverges from that in the EU. 
 General data protection regulation 
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, and it imposes heightened requirements on companies that process health and other sensitive data, such as requiring in many situations that a company obtain the consent of the individuals to whom the sensitive personal data relate before processing such data. Examples of obligations imposed by the GDPR on companies processing personal data that fall within the scope of the GDPR include providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, appointing a data protection officer, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, or Privacy Shield, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S.  The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S.  While we were not self-certified under the Privacy Shield, this CJEU decision may lead to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EU to the U.S. generally and increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation.  Following the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the U.K. and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR.
 Coverage, pricing, and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to 
 37


reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Sales of our products will depend, in significant part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. 
 Within the United States, third-party payors include government authorities or government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Some third-party payors may manage utilization of a particular product by requiring pre-approval (known as “prior authorization”) for coverage of particular prescriptions (to allow the payor to assess medical necessity). Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain net price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of new products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for any current or future product, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. There is an emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and we expect the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing will increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval from one or more third party payors, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 If we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current product candidates in the United States, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country because this is not yet the subject of harmonized EU law. Many countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval and others with “peg” their pricing to a basket of other countries. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Some member states, in addition to controlling pricing will monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Healthcare law and regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to healthcare providers and patient privacy 
 38


laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including certain laws and regulations applicable only if we have marketed products, include the following: 
  
• | federal false claims, false statements and civil monetary penalties laws prohibiting, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual for the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with certain healthcare providers to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for re-disclosure to the public, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state laws requiring pharmaceutical companies to comply with specific compliance standards, restrict financial interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments to health care providers or marketing expenditures; and

 Health care and other reform 
 In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under Healthcare Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has been subject to judicial challenge. The case Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act, including provisions that are unrelated to healthcare reform but were enacted as part of the Healthcare Reform Act, was argued before the Supreme Court in November 2020.  Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the Healthcare Reform Act but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. 
 Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts, including a number of recent actions.  Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers.  Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products.  For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap increased from 50% to 70%.  A number of regulations were issued in late 2020 and early 2021.  For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs and health plans.  Some of these changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge.  For example, courts temporarily enjoined a new “most favored nation” payment model for select drugs covered under Medicare Part B that was to take effect on January 1, 2021 and would limit payment based on international drug price.  
 The nature and scope of health care reform in the wake of the transition from the Trump administration to the Biden administration remains uncertain.  The Department of Justice under the Biden administration informed the Supreme Court that the government no 
 39


longer takes the position that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and cannot be severed from the rest of the Healthcare Reform Act.  President Biden has temporarily halted implementation of new rules issued immediately prior to the transition that had not yet taken effect (which include a number of health care reforms) to allow for review by the new administration.  The revisions to the federal anti-kickback statute regulations referenced above were initially scheduled to take effect in 2022 but have now been delayed to 2023. More generally, President Biden supported reforms to lower drug prices during his campaign for the presidency.
 General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
