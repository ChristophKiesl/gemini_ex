ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
Overview 
A-Mark, also referred to (together with its subsidiaries) as "we", "us" and the "Company", is a full-service precious metals trading company. It is a wholesaler of gold, silver, platinum and palladium bullion and related products, including bars, wafers, grain and coins. A-Mark also: 

• | distributes gold and silver coins and bars from sovereign and private mints; 
• | provides financing for and other services relating to the purchase and sale of bullion and numismatics; 
• | offers secure storage for bullion; 
• | provides our customers an array of complementary services, including packaging, shipping, handling, receiving, processing and inventorying of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis; and 
• | provides a variety of custom fabricated silver bullion and other specialty products through its mint operations. 

A-Mark believes it has one of the largest customer bases in each of its markets and provides one of the most comprehensive offerings of products and services in the precious metals trading industry. Our customers include mints, manufacturers and fabricators, refiners, coin and bullion dealers, e-commerce retailers, banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, industrial users of precious metals, investors and collectors. We serve customers on six continents, with over 10% of our customers located outside the United States. 
A-Mark believes its businesses largely function independently of the price movement of the underlying commodities. However, factors such as global economic activity or uncertainty and inflationary trends, which affect market volatility, have the potential to impact demand, volumes and margins.
We conduct our operations within one business segment.
History
A-Mark was founded in 1965 as a small numismatics firm, which subsequently grew to include wholesale bullion trading and precious metals financing. Spectrum Group International, Inc. ("SGI"), then known as Greg Manning Auctions, Inc., acquired an 80% interest in A-Mark in 2005. The remaining 20% of A-Mark was acquired by Afinsa Bienes Tangibles, S.A. ("Afinsa"), at the time SGI's controlling shareholder. In 2012, SGI acquired from Afinsa its interest in A-Mark, as a result of which A-Mark became a wholly-owned subsidiary of SGI. 
In March 2014, SGI distributed all of the shares of common stock of A-Mark to its stockholders, effecting a spinoff of A-Mark from SGI. As a result of this distribution, which we refer to as the spinoff, the Company became a publicly traded company independent from SGI. 
Over the years, A-Mark has been steadily expanding its products and services. In 1986, A-Mark became an authorized purchaser of gold and silver coins struck by the United States Mint. Similar arrangements with other sovereign mints followed, so that by the early 1990s, A-Mark had relationships with all major sovereign mints offering bullion coins and bars internationally. In 2005, A-Mark launched its Collateral Finance Corporation ("CFC") subsidiary for the purpose of making secured wholesale and retail loans collateralized by numismatic and semi-numismatic coins and bullion. 
A-Mark opened an overseas office in Vienna, Austria in 2009, for the purpose of marketing its goods and services in the European markets, and the office commenced full trading activity in 2012. This resulted in the expansion of A-Mark's trading hours from 12 to 21 hours a day, 5 days a week. Also in 2012, A-Mark formed Transcontinental Depository Services, LLC ("TDS"), a subsidiary that provides customers with turn-key global storage solutions for their precious metals and precious metal products. 
In July 2015, we launched our Las Vegas-based logistics fulfillment center, A-M Global Logistics, LLC, which provides our customers an array of complementary services, including packaging, shipping, handling, receiving, processing and inventorying of precious metals and custom coins on a secure basis.
Our minting operations commenced in August 2016, when we formed a joint venture, AM&ST Associates, LLC ("AMST"), with SilverTowne L.P., an Indiana-based fabricator of silver bullion products, to acquire its minting business. We own a majority interest in AMST.

Business Strategy
Through strategic relationships with its customers and suppliers and vertical integration across its markets, A-Mark seeks to grow its business volume, expand its presence in non-U.S. markets around the globe, with a principal focus on Europe and Asia, and enlarge its offering of complementary products and services. A-Mark seeks to continue its expansion by building on its strengths and what it perceives to be its competitive advantages. These include: 

• | integrated operations that span trading, distribution, minting, storage, financing and other consignment products and services; 
• | an extensive and varied customer base that includes banks and other financial institutions, coin dealers, collectors, private investors, investment advisors, industrial manufacturers, refiners, sovereign mints and mines;
• | secure storage for bullion; 
• | access to primary market makers, suppliers, refiners and government mints that provide a dependable supply of precious metals and precious metal products; 
• | trading offices in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria, giving our customers live access to our trading desk 21 hours each trading day, even when many major world commodity markets are closed; 
• | the largest precious metals dealer network in North America; 
• | depository relationships in major financial centers around the world; 
• | experienced traders who effectively manage A-Mark's exposure to commodity price risk; and 
• | a strong management team, with over 100 years of collective industry experience. 

Business Units 
A-Mark operates through several business units comprising a single segment for accounting purposes, including Industrial, Coin and Bar, Trading and Finance, CFC, TDS, Logistics and Minting. 
Industrial. Our Industrial unit sells gold, silver, platinum and palladium to industrial and commercial users. Customers include coin fabricators such as mints, industrial manufacturers and fabricators, including electronics, component parts companies, and refiners. Depending on the intended usage, the metals are either investment or industrial grade and are generally in the form of bars, wafers, plates, or grains. 
Coin and Bar. Our Coin and Bar unit deals in over 200 different products, including gold and silver coins from around the world and gold, silver, platinum and palladium bars and ingots in a variety of weights, shapes and sizes. We currently market a limited number of such products with our proprietary “A-Mark” rounds and bars. Our customers are primarily coin and bullion dealers, although we also deal directly with banks and other financial institutions, commodity brokerage houses, manufacturers, investors, investment advisors, and collectors who qualify as “eligible commercial entities” and “eligible contract participants,” as those terms are defined in the Commodity Exchange Act. Our customers range in size from large financial institutions to small local dealers. 
We are an authorized distributor (and, in the case of the United States Mint, an authorized purchaser) of gold and silver coins for all of the major sovereign mints and various private mints. The sovereign mints include the United States Mint, the Australian (Perth) Mint, the Austrian Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, the China Mint, Banco de Mexico, the South African Mint (Rand Refinery) and the Royal Mint (United Kingdom). We purchase and take delivery of coins from the mints for resale to coin dealers and other qualified purchasers. 
Our distribution and purchase agreements with the mints are non-exclusive, and may be terminated by the mints at any time, although in practice our relationship with the mints are long-standing, in some cases, as with the U.S. Mint, extending back for over 20 years. In some cases, we have developed exclusive products with sovereign and private mints for distribution through our dealer network. 
In our Industrial and Coin and Bar units, orders are taken primarily telephonically and also on an electronic trading platform. Pricing is generally based on screen quotes for bullion transactions in the spot market, with two-day settlement, although special pricing and extended settlement terms are also available. For example, a customer can leave an order with A-Mark to purchase at a specified price below the current market price or an order to sell at a specified price above the current market price. Almost all customers in these units take physical delivery of the precious metal. Product is shipped upon receipt of payment, except where the purchase is financed under credit arrangements between A-Mark and the customer. We have relationships with precious metal depositories around the world to facilitate shipment of product from our inventory to these customers, in many cases for next day delivery. Product may either be drop shipped to the customer's location or delivered to a depository or other storage

facility designated by the customer. The Company also periodically loans metals to customers on a short-term consignment basis, and may charge interest fees based on the value of the metals loaned. Such metal inventories are removed at the time the customers elect to price and purchase the metals, and the Company records a corresponding sale and receivable. 
Trading and Finance. Our Trading and Finance units engage in commodity hedging and borrowing and lending transactions in support of our Industrial and Coin and Bar units. 
The Trading unit hedges the commodity risk on A-Mark's inventory in order to protect A-Mark from price fluctuations in situations where settlement of a transaction is delayed or deferred. A-Mark maintains relationships with major market-makers and multiple futures brokers in order to provide a variety of alternatives for its hedging needs. Our traders employ a combination of future and spot transactions to hedge transactional exposure, and a combination of future, and forward contracts to hedge inventory exposure. Because it seeks to substantially hedge its market exposure, A-Mark believes that its business largely functions independently of the price movements of the underlying commodities. Through its hedging activities, A-Mark may also earn contango yields, in which futures price are higher than the spot prices, or backwardation yields, in which futures prices are lower than the spot prices. A-Mark also offers precious metals price quotes in a number of foreign currencies. 
Our Finance unit engages in precious metals borrowing and lending transactions and other customized financial transactions with or on behalf of our customers and other counterparties. These arrangements range from simple hedging structures to complex inventory finance arrangements and forward purchase and sale structures, tailored to the needs of our customers.
CFC. Our Collateral Finance Corporation subsidiary is a California licensed finance lender that makes and acquires commercial loans secured by numismatic and semi-numismatic coins and bullion. CFC's customers include coin and precious metal dealers, investors and collectors. CFC's activities are complementary to our bullion and coin businesses, and affords customers a convenient means of financing their inventory or collections. CFC takes physical delivery of the coins or bullion collateralizing the loans, and requires loan-to-value ratios of between 50% and 85%. The loan-to-value ratio refers to the principal amount of the loan divided by the liquidation value of the collateral, as conservatively estimated by CFC. Secured loans include a combination of on-demand and short term (i.e., with terms of between three and twelve months) facilities, and bear interest at fixed rates prevailing at the time the loan is made. Other terms of the loan may be customized in accordance with the particular needs and circumstances of the borrower. 
TDS. Our Transcontinental Depository Services subsidiary provides storage solutions for precious metals and numismatic coins for financial institutions, dealers, investors and collectors worldwide. TDS contracts on behalf of our clients with independent storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe, Singapore and Hong Kong, for either fully segregated or allocated storage. We assist our clients in developing appropriate storage options for their particular requirements, and we manage the operational aspects of the storage with the third party facilities on our clients' behalf. 
Logistics. Our A-Mark Global Logistics ("Logistics") subsidiary, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, supports our wholesale trading business by providing a significant amount of the secured storage, shipping and delivery services that had historically been outsourced to third-party depositories in their various locations. By consolidating those operations into one central location under our control, we have reduced our dependence on third-party service providers while enhancing quality control and reducing operating costs.
Logistics also provides turn-key logistics services to our customers engaged in the retail business. We provide these customers with one-stop financing, hedging, inventory handling, storage and drop-shipping services.
Minting. Through its ownership interest in AMST, the Company holds a majority interest in the SilverTowne Mint, a long-standing producer of fabricated silver bullion products. We have entered into an exclusive distributorship agreement with AMST, which has enabled us to expand our offerings of custom coin and other specialty products.
Market Making Activity
We act as a principal market maker, maintaining a two-way market for buying and selling precious metals. This means we both sell product to and purchase product from our customers. 
 5


Inventory 
We maintain a substantial inventory of bullion and coins in order to provide our customers with selection and prompt delivery. We acquire product for our inventory in the course of our trading activities with our customers, directly from mints, mines and refiners and from commodities brokers and dealers, privately and in transactions on established commodity exchanges. Except for certain lower of cost or market products, our inventory is “marked to market” daily for accounting and financial reporting purposes. 
Sales and Marketing
We market our products and services primarily through our offices in El Segundo, California and Vienna, Austria, our website and our dealer network, which we believe is the largest of its kind in North America. The dealer network consists of over 1,000 independent precious metal and coin companies, with whom we transact on a non-exclusive basis. The arrangements with the dealers vary, but generally the dealers acquire product from us for resale to their customers. In some instances, we deliver bullion to the dealers on a consignment basis. We also participate from time to time in trade shows and conventions, at which we promote our products and services. 
As a vertically integrated precious metals concern, a key element of our marketing strategy is being able to cross-sell our products and services to customers within our various business units. 
Operational Support 
A-Mark maintains administrative and operational support at its office in El Segundo, California for processing its trading and service activities and arranging for physical delivery and storage of product. We believe that our existing administrative and operational support infrastructure has the capacity to scale up with our business activities. We store our inventories of bullion and numismatics at third party depositories in major financial centers around the world and at our facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
With a third party software developer, we have created a proprietary trading program, referred to as the Metals Trading System ("MTS"). Through MTS we are able to input, process, track and document our trading activity, including complex hedging and similar transactions. We have developed and implemented an electronic trading platform for receiving and processing customer orders, with the objective of improving transactional ease and efficiency. In fiscal 2018, the Company expects to complete its integration of MTS with a new business management system.
Supplier and Customer Concentrations 
A-Mark buys a majority of its precious metals from a limited number of suppliers. The Company believes that numerous other suppliers are available and would provide similar products on comparable terms.
For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company had two customers, HSBC Bank USA and Mitsubishi Intl. Corporation, each comprising more than 10% of our revenues (see Note 17.) 
Trading Competition
A-Mark's activities cover a broad spectrum of the precious metals industry, with a concentration on the physical market. We service public, industrial and private sector consumers of precious metals which include industrial manufactures, refiners, minting facilities, banks, brokerage houses and private investors. We frequently face different competitors in each area and it is not uncommon for a customer and/or a supplier in one market segment to be a competitor in another. Our competitors may offer more favorable pricing or services considered to be superior to ours.
Trading Seasonality
While our precious metals trading business is not seasonal, we believe it is directly impacted by the perception of market trends and global economic activity. Historically, anticipation of increases in the rate of inflation, interest rates as well as anticipated devaluation of the U.S. dollar, have resulted in higher levels of interest in precious metals as well as higher prices for such metals. 
Employees
As of June 30, 2017, we had 127 employees, with 125 located in North America, and 2 located in Europe; all except 2 of these employees were considered full-time employees.
We regard our relations with our employees as good.

Recent Acquisition
On August 28, 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Goldline Acquisition Corp. (“GAC”), consummated the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Goldline, LLC (the “Seller), a direct retailer of precious metals to the investor community (the “Acquisition”), pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated August 14, 2017. The aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) for the Acquisition was approximately $10.0 million. The Purchase Price is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, GAC entered into a privately placed credit facility in the amount of $7.5 million (the “GAC Credit Facility”) with various lenders, effective August 28, 2017. Borrowings under the GAC Credit Facility were used to finance a portion of the consideration payable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.
The GAC Credit Facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of GAC, and is guaranteed by the Company. Interest on the GAC Credit Facility is payable quarterly at the rate of 8.5% per annum, and the lenders under the GAC Credit Facility are entitled to an additional payment at maturity equal to the greater of 3% of the principal amount of the GAC Credit Facility and 10% of cumulative three-year EBITDA of GAC in excess of $10 million, on a pro rata basis. The GAC Credit Facility has a three-year maturity. The obligations of GAC and the Company pursuant to the documentation governing the GAC Credit Facility are subordinated to the Company’s obligations under the Uncommitted Credit Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2016, as amended, among the Company, Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. New York Branch, as administrative agent, and the lenders named therein (the “Uncommitted Credit Agreement”) including, among other subordination terms, that, the lenders under the GAC Credit Facility will be permitted to collect regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest, provided that no event of default is continuing under the Uncommitted Credit Agreement and the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants pursuant to the Uncommitted Credit Agreement (see Note 19).
