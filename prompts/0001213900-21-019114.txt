ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on June 3, 2020, as a business company with limited liability and formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, contractual control arrangement with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, or engaging in any other similar initial business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “initial business combination.” While we may pursue an initial business combination in any region or sector, we have initially focused our efforts on companies in the telecommunications infrastructure, internet and technology and consumer goods and services sectors operating in Russia as targets for our initial business combination.


On June 8, 2020, our sponsor subscribed for, and we issued to it, an aggregate of 6,250,000 of our ordinary shares for a total subscription price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. On July 15, 2020, we effected a share split whereby each of our 6,250,000 then issued ordinary shares was sub-divided into 1.23 shares, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 7,687,500 ordinary shares. The founder shares held by our sponsor included an aggregate of up to 937,500 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units was not exercised in full, so that our sponsor would own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering plus the number of ordinary shares that were to be sold pursuant to the forward purchase agreement. On September 17, 2020, the underwriters notified us that the over-allotment was not exercised, and as a result, 937,500 Kismet ordinary shares were forfeited and cancelled, effective as of September 19, 2020.
 
The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-239972) for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 5, 2020. On August 10, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 25,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we consummated a private placement of 6,750,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,750,000.
 
A total of $250,000,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, including as a result of the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and were initially held in cash and subsequently invested in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account as described elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 
We incurred offering costs of approximately $14.3 million, inclusive of approximately $8.8 million in deferred underwriting commissions.
 
Our units began trading on August 6, 2020 on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “KSMTU.” Commencing on September 28, 2020, the ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “KSMT” and “KSMTW”, respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “KSMTU.”

Proposed Business Combination
 
On January 31, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Nexters Inc., a British Virgin Islands business company (“Pubco”), our sponsor, solely in its capacity as our Representative, Nexters Global Ltd. (“Nexters Global”), a private limited liability company domiciled in Cyprus, Fantina Holdings Limited, a private limited liability company domiciled in Cyprus, solely in its capacity as Nexters Global Shareholders Representative, and the shareholders of Nexters Global. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things, we agreed to combine with Nexters Global in a business combination whereby we will merge with and into Pubco with Pubco surviving the merger and the security holders of Kismet (other than security holders of Kismet electing to redeem their Kismet ordinary shares) becoming security holders of Pubco (the “Merger”) and Pubco will purchase all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Nexters Global from the holders of the Nexter Global’s share capital for a combination of cash and Pubco ordinary shares, making Nexters Global a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (the “Share Acquisition”). Pubco is a newly formed entity that was formed for the sole purpose of entering and consummating the transactions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. Nexters Global is one of the largest and most seasoned European gaming unicorns with deep expertise in mobile game development and marketing. It is a developer and publisher of Hero Wars mid-core RPG franchise, currently available on mobile (iOS, Android) and PC (via web and Facebook) and is looking to launch three new titles in 2021. 
 The transaction, which we refer to as the proposed business combination, is subject to certain conditions, including: (i) our shareholders having approved, among other things, the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement; (ii) the absence of any law or governmental order that would prohibit the proposed transactions; (iii) the termination or expiration of all required waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “Hart-Scott-Rodino Act”) (iv) our company having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) remaining after the closing; (v) our company and Pubco having at least $100 million of cash either in or outside of the trust account, after taking into accounts payments by us for the redemption and any proceeds received by Pubco under the A&R Forward Purchase Agreement (defined below); (vi) the Registration Statement having been declared effective by the SEC and remaining effective; and (vii) the Pubco ordinary shares and Pubco warrants having been approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject only to official notice thereof. The proposed business combination is more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 
A copy of the Business Combination Agreement was included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 1, 2021 and is also filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. The foregoing description of the Business Combination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the proposed business combination.
 
Unless specifically stated, this Annual Report does not give effect to the proposed business combination and does not contain the risks associated with the proposed business combination. Such risks and effects relating to the proposed business combination will be included in our preliminary prospectus/proxy statement to be included in a Registration Statement on Form F-4 that Nexters Inc. will file with the SEC relating to the proposed business combination.
 
Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement
 
On January 31, 2021, we, Pubco and the sponsor entered into an amended and restated forward purchase agreement (the “A&R Forward Purchase Agreement”). The A&R Forward Purchase Agreement amends the forward purchase agreement, dated August 5, 2020, between us and the sponsor by, among other things, increasing the sponsor’s purchase commitment thereunder from $20 million to $50 million and replacing the sponsor’s commitment to acquire our public units with a commitment to acquire Pubco ordinary shares and Pubco public warrants in a private placement to occur after, and subject to, the Merger closing and prior to the Share Acquisition closing. The foregoing description of the A&R Forward Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of A&R Forward Purchase Agreement, a copy of which was included as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 1, 2021 and is also filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. 
 
Lock-Up Agreements
 
In connection with the proposed business combination with Nexters Global, by no later than the Merger closing date the three Holders will enter into a lock-up agreement with Pubco, and our sponsor will enter into a separate lock-up agreement with Pubco (collectively, the “Lock-Up Agreements”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to certain exceptions as set forth therein, for a period of one year following the Share Acquisition closing (in the case of the three Holders) and for a period of one year following the Merger closing (in the case of our sponsor), as applicable, each such holder will not transfer any of such holder’s Pubco securities. The foregoing description of the Lock-Up Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the Lock-Up Agreements, copies of which are included as Exhibits B-1 and B-2 to the Business Combination Agreement, which was included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 1, 2021 and is also filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.

New Registration Rights Agreement 
 
In connection with the proposed business combination with Nexters Global, Pubco, our sponsor and three current significant shareholders of Nexters Global (collectively, the “Holders”) will enter into a new registration rights agreement (the “New Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions, including with regard to the number of demand rights that may be exercised, the Holders may demand at any time or from time to time, that Pubco file a registration statement with the SEC to register the securities of Pubco held by such Holders. The New Registration Rights Agreement will also provide the Holders with “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions. The foregoing description of the New Registration Rights Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of the New Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is included as Exhibit A to the Business Combination Agreement which was included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 1, 2021 and is also filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report.
Kismet Acquisition Two Corp.
 
In September 2020, Mr. Tavrin, our Chairman and CEO, founded Kismet Acquisition Two Corp. (“Kismet Two”), a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting a business combination. Kismet Two completed its initial public offering in February 2021, in which it sold 23,000,000 units, which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.001 per share, and one-third of one redeemable warrant, and was sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate proceeds of $230,000,000. Kismet Two’s units currently trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “KAIIU”. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “KAII” and “KAIIW,” respectively. Mr. Tavrin is the Chairman and CEO of Kismet Two and two of our directors, Verdi Israelyan and Clifford Tompsett, serve as directors of Kismet Two. Each of the foregoing owe fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law to Kismet Two. Kismet Two has not yet announced or consummated its business combination.
Kismet Acquisition Three Corp.
 
In September 2020, Mr. Tavrin, also founded Kismet Acquisition Three Corp. (“Kismet Three”), a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting a business combination. Kismet Three completed its initial public offering in February 2021, in which it sold 28,750,000 units, which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.001 per share, and one-third of one redeemable warrant, and was sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate proceeds of $287,500,000. Kismet Three’s units currently trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “KIIIU”. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “KIII” and “KIIIW,” respectively. Mr. Tavrin is the Chairman and CEO of Kismet Three, and one of our directors, Clifford Tompsett, also serves as a director of Kismet Three. Each of the foregoing owes fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law to Kismet Three. Kismet Three has not yet announced or consummated its business combination.
Business Strategy
 
We have and continue to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ivan Tavrin. Mr. Tavrin is a Russian entrepreneur with substantial experience in building, operating and investing in businesses, predominantly in TMT and consumer industries, both in the private and public markets. Mr. Tavrin is a founder of UTH Russia Limited (operating under Media-1 brand), or UTH, one of the largest independent media broadcasting groups in Russia, which comprises 3 television networks, including leading musical channel Muz-TV, reality TV channel U and the Disney Channel (Russia) owned pursuant to a joint venture with The Walt Disney Company, or Disney (NYSE: DIS). Mr. Tavrin is an indirect controlling shareholder in a leading regional radio network “Vyberi Radio”, in the largest digital out-of-home advertising operator in Russia “Gallery” and in a leading telecommunications infrastructure provider “Vertical”. His past experience includes serving, from 2012 to 2016, as the chief executive officer of PJSC MegaFon (“MegaFon”), the second largest telecommunications operator in Russia as of December 31, 2016, having led its US$1.8 billion initial public offering and dual listing on the London Stock Exchange and Moscow Exchange in 2012. He also served as a board member at Mail.ru Group Limited (“Mail.ru Group”), one of the largest companies in the Russian-speaking internet market.

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector and in any region, we have initially focused on industries that complement our management team’s background so we can capitalize on their ability to identify, acquire and operate a business. We have initially focused on companies in the telecommunications infrastructure, internet and technology and consumer goods and services sectors operating in Russia (which may include a business based in Russia which has operations or opportunities outside of Russia or a business based outside of Russia which has operations or opportunities in Russia); however, we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that is not based in, and does not have any operations or opportunities in Russia.
 
We believe our sponsor’s and management team’s deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise, as well as their network of contacts have uniquely positioned us to take advantage of proprietary opportunities in the telecommunications, internet and technology and consumer goods and services sectors, where we believe opportunities exist to employ a “buy and build” (roll-up) strategy to consolidate assets across fragmented sub-sectors, creating new majors with improved efficiencies and network effects through scale. We believe this expertise and network of contacts have allowed us to generate a number of acquisition opportunities. As a result of our investing and operating expertise, we believe there are a number of high-quality telecommunications, internet and technology and consumer goods and services sector businesses in Russia with adequate scale to be attractive public companies in the United States, in particular operating within the following sub-sectors:
 

● | Telecommunications infrastructure
--+----------------------------------

 
In recent years there has been significant growth in demand for mobile data in Russia with the improvement in 3rd and 4th generation connectivity standards, which are now moving towards 5th generation connectivity standards. There has also been increasing coverage of more rural and remote areas as well as data transmission growth. Meeting such demand will require investment in the infrastructure network. In the current marketplace there is limited infrastructure sharing in Russia. We believe that there is growing recognition among mobile network operators that some elements of telecommunications infrastructure do not deliver competitive benefits relative to the benefits provided by portfolio sharing, which we believe may in turn lead to the establishment of independent infrastructure players providing services to multiple operators as is evident in many other developed and emerging markets. We believe that there may be an opportunity in the Russian market to invest in telecommunications infrastructure businesses to provide services to multiple mobile network operators, and to employ a roll-up strategy to seek to achieve trading multiples arbitrage, increased operating leverage through scale and improved operational efficiency.
 

● | Internet and technology
--+------------------------

 
The Russian internet market is the largest in Europe and the 8th largest in the world based on the number of internet users and we believe that the market will continue to grow, driven by the increase in penetration of mobile internet usage and a further shift from offline to online channels changing consumers’ behavior patterns. However, at the time of our initial public offering there were only three publicly traded companies operating internet businesses in Russia, and we believe that there may be an opportunity to establish a holding company which would bring to the public market one or more existing private companies that operate within the internet and technology sector.
 

● | Consumer goods and services
--+----------------------------

 
The Russian economy has low but growing penetration of consumer oriented businesses across multiple verticals, including food and non-food retail, hospitality, private healthcare, fast-moving consumer goods, out of home dining, entertainment and others. We believe that many of the industries in the consumer space remain highly fragmented, especially in the Russian regions, and that there may be opportunities to acquire one or more consumer focused businesses and pursue a “buy and build” consolidation strategy.
 
We seek out potential targets that we believe have proven business models and attractive growth profiles. We also believe our sponsor’s and management team’s extensive experience in deal sourcing from private and public sources, as well as their advisory and consulting engagements, provide unique insight when identifying potential business combination opportunities and creating value. We believe their experience and proximity to real-time information positions us to obtain access to differentiated deal flow, frequently in a non-competitive manner and prior to other parties with an interest in such transactions.
 
4

 

Furthermore, we believe that limited access to capital markets and a scarcity of long-term private equity capital in Russia has created significant demand from companies seeking to raise capital or otherwise achieve liquidity. Under conditions where the Russian capital markets are less developed than the U.S. capital markets, we believe we can provide the target company with an attractive alternative path to a public listing or sale. In particular, due to limited liquidity in the last six years, there is a subset of private equity and venture capital portfolio companies where a liquidity event is required due to an end of the investment cycle. We believe the reduced liquidity and increased market volatility in the Russian economy will allow us to capture opportunities on attractive terms.
 
We believe the following factors represent a strong rationale for pursuing our business strategy:
 

● | Portfolio rationalization (including optimization of corporate structure, divestment of non-core assets or transformation from an asset-heavy to asset-light business model) is especially relevant for businesses in the turbulent and competitive environment prevalent today, particularly in the telecommunications industry, and may lead to acquisition opportunities for the Company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Devaluation of the Russian Ruble has created opportunities in salary arbitrage, which aided many companies in strengthening their competitive advantage in export potential, especially in information technology and software, production, outsourcing and other sectors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Import substitution in pharmaceuticals, food, consumer and other industries is strongly supported by the Russian Government and may also lead to growth of consumer expenditures by creating low-cost substitutes to imported products which benefit Russian businesses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with this strategy, we identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.
 
We seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 

● | have strong competitive positions, proven business models and attractive growth prospects;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have limited access to capital markets due to external factors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | could benefit from the substantial expertise, experience and network of our sponsor and management team, who could assist with, for example, growth strategy, international expansion, operations and the evaluation and integration of acquisitions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are well positioned to participate in sector consolidation and would benefit from a public acquisition currency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | would avoid the potentially onerous terms, such as liquidation preferences, that are often characteristic of late stage private growth financing rounds; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.
--+----------------------------------------

 
These criteria and guidelines are not exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.

Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable, if any, on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable, if any, on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. If our securities are not listed on Nasdaq, we would not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we have and will continue to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We have and will continue to utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
Given our experience, we have the capacity to appropriately source opportunities and conduct a substantial portion of due diligence ourselves, relying less on third parties than many other similar companies.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, although we do not intend to do so. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.

Post-Acquisition Leadership
 
After the initial business combination, we will seek to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing shareholder value through our participation on the board of directors or through direct involvement with company operations or both. We intend to rely on the extensive professional network of our founder including, long term associates and former employees and will assemble a team of industry experts that have the most relevant expertise to enhance the shareholder value.
 
Our Management Team
 
For a description of our management team, See Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report.
 
Assistance from Affiliated Persons
 
In addition to the members of our management team, our investment team includes investment partners at affiliates of our sponsor. These individuals have dedicated, and we expect will continue to dedicate, some of their professional time to our affairs:
 
Evgeny Fridman worked at MegaFon between 2009 and 2014, and most recently served as head of investment analysis and investor relations. From 2006 to 2008, Mr. Fridman worked as an investment analyst and portfolio manager at Eden Financial, a London-based investment management firm and prior to that held various finance and IT related roles starting from 2001. He holds an MSc in Finance from Cranfield University in the UK.
 
Svetlana Ushakova served as a deputy to the chief financial officer at MegaFon and was responsible for MegaFon’s corporate finance and treasury activities between 2012 and 2017. Prior to MegaFon, between 2010 and 2012, she was a director for Capital Markets at UC Rusal, the largest aluminum producer in the world, where she was responsible for public capital markets and structuring products of the group. From 2004 to 2010, Ms. Ushakova served as part of the senior E&R coverage investment banking team of ABN AMRO Bank covering the largest Russian and CIS O&G and P&U clients across all spectrums of financial products. Prior to ABN Amro, she spent two years within a London coal desk at Noble group, a leading global commodity trading firm. She holds an MSc in Accounting and Finance from London School of Economics and Political Science.
 
Oleg Bibergan worked at Goldman Sachs between 2007 and 2020, first as an analyst, then as an associate and later as an executive director of Special Situations Group, a principal investments unit of Goldman Sachs. As an executive director, he was responsible for Goldman Sachs’ investments in IXCellerate, the leading carrier-neutral datacenter platform in Russia; Headhunter, the leading Russian job board (Nasdaq: HHR); Cian, the leading Russian real estate classified platform; OneTwoTrip, the leading Russian online travel agency; and Kaspi.kz, the leading Kazakh fintech/e-commerce ecosystem. Mr Bibergan also serves as an observer on the board of several global VC-backed businesses including Miro and Dostavista. Mr. Bibergan holds a degree in Economics from Harvard University.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
 
7

 

Employees
 
We currently have one executive officer. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team devotes in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our ordinary shares under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on an initial business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
