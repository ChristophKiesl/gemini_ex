ITEM 1.      BUSINESS
Chimerix Overview
Chimerix is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to accelerating the advancement of innovative medicines that make a meaningful impact in the lives of patients living with cancer and other serious diseases. Our three most advanced clinical-stage development programs are brincidofovir (BCV), ONC201 and dociparstat sodium (DSTAT). BCV is an antiviral drug candidate developed as a potential medical countermeasure for smallpox and is currently under review for regulatory approval in the United States. ONC201 is currently being investigated in a number of efficacy studies for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma and a confirmatory response rate assessment, potentially sufficient for accelerated approval, is expected later this year. DSTAT is in Phase 3 development as a potential first-line therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and as a potential treatment for acute lung injury (ALI) in COVID-19 patients.
Brincidofovir (BCV)
BCV is an investigational lipid conjugate which acts via inhibition of viral DNA synthesis that is in development as a medical countermeasure for smallpox. It is being developed under the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, which allows for testing of investigational drugs in animal models to support the effectiveness of treatments against diseases that are not ethical or feasible to study in humans.
We completed the rolling NDA submission for BCV tablets and for BCV suspension for the approval of BCV as a medical countermeasure for smallpox. In December 2020 we announced that the FDA had accepted the filing of the NDA. The FDA granted priority review and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 7, 2021. In January 2021, we received notification from the FDA that the PDUFA date for review of BCV as a medical countermeasure for smallpox has been moved to July 7, 2021. Specifically, FDA requested we provide a dose recommendation for infants up to three months of age. In response, we submitted to the FDA the requested modelled analyses, which resulted in the same weight-based dosing recommendation previously proposed for older pediatric patients. The ability to dose across all pediatric age groups with a convenient oral suspension formulation is a unique aspect of the BCV smallpox treatment. The FDA required an additional three months to review this information. We do not expect a delayed FDA action date to impact the timing of the BARDA request for proposal, which is expected this quarter, nor the potential timing of first shipments of BCV to the strategic national stockpile, expected in the second half of this year.
BCV has received Fast Track designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of smallpox. 
We are collaborating with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of BCV as a potential medical countermeasure for smallpox. Efficacy is to be demonstrated via two animal models under the FDA’s Animal Efficacy Rule. 
Prior to May 2019, we had been developing oral and intravenous BCV for the treatment and prevention of multiple DNA viruses. In May 2019, we decided to discontinue both the oral and IV development programs of BCV in adenovirus (AdV) and the associated clinical trials. 
In September 2019, we entered into a license agreement for certain rights to BCV with SymBio Pharmaceuticals. Under the terms of the agreement SymBio received exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize BCV in all human indications, excluding the prevention and treatment of orthopox viruses, which includes smallpox. Also, per the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5 million plus potential clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $180 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of BCV worldwide.
Oncoceutics Acquisition
On January 7, 2021, we acquired Oncoceutics, Inc. (Oncoceutics), a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, a novel potential class of small molecule compounds. Oncoceutics’ lead product candidate, ONC201, selectively induced cell death in multiple cancer types in clinical trials. ONC201 is currently being evaluated in a registrational program for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma and a response rate assessment of the registrational cohort is expected in 2021. 
Imipridones and ONC201
Imipridones are a potential new class of selective cancer therapies. These drug candidates target specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP), in an effort to produce cancer cell death. The imipridone chemical scaffold provides an opportunity to target GPCRs and ClpP with differential specificity and function. This presents an opportunity to develop potential imipridone therapies broadly within cancer and in other diseases as well.
ONC201 selectively targets Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2) and ClpP. ONC201 has selectively induced cell death in cancer by binding to and differentially altering activity of DRD2 and ClpP.
Clinical trials of ONC201 in glioma patients with the H3 K27M-mutation are underway at several locations in the U.S. As many as 10% of patients with glioma have the H3 K27M-mutation. The H3 K27M-mutation is found in 50-90% of patients with midline glioma, including 80-90% of children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or DIPG. Currently there is no effective therapy for patients with the H3 K27M-mutation beyond radiation that provides only transient benefit in a fraction of the population. Often it is not possible to resect these tumors and chemotherapy is ineffective. The median overall survival following progression from first-line therapy is approximately 8 months.
Based on discussions with the FDA, we plan to integrate data from ongoing ONC201 trials into a registration cohort with the potential for an NDA submission seeking accelerated approval. The 50 subject registration cohort includes patients meeting the following eligibility criteria: greater than 2 years of age with recurrent diffuse midline glioma whose tumors harbor the H3 K27M-mutation, evidence of measurable disease, completion of prior radiation that was at least 90 days from starting ONC201 and evidence of progressive disease, amongst other criteria. The primary endpoint of the study is Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
assessed by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology high-grade glioma (RANO-HGG) criteria. Below is an interim response summary, which shows a meaningful durability of response among those subjects that respond to therapy.
Figure 1: Waterfall plot reflects 47 subjects; 3 subjects did not have on-treatment tumor assessments available but were reported by investigator to have progressive disease. Some eligibility and response data were based on unlocked CRFs that remain subject to change with additional monitoring. PR is partial response, SD is stable disease and PD is progressive disease.
A Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) analysis of the ORR is expected to take place in 2021 which, if favorable, may form the basis for an NDA submission seeking accelerated approval of ONC201 in the United States. ONC201 has been generally well tolerated across a database of over 350 glioma patients. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were nausea/vomiting, fatigue and decreased lymphocyte counts. Dose limiting toxicities have not been observed with weekly dosing in any indication.
The FDA has granted ONC201 Fast Track Designation for the treatment of adult recurrent H3 K27M-mutant high-grade glioma, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for treatment of H3 K27M-mutant glioma, and Orphan Drug Designations for the treatment of glioblastoma and for the treatment of malignant glioma.
In addition to clinical trials in glioma, ONC201 is also being studied in an ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial in neuroendocrine tumors at the Cleveland Clinic. Interim investigator assessments as of a cutoff date of August 20, 2020 showed investigator assessed objective responses in paraganglioma which are adrenal-related tumors that are known to harbor elevated DRD2 expression and dopamine secretion.
ONC206
ONC206 is a DRD2 antagonist and ClpP agonist that demonstrated enhanced non-competitive DRD2 antagonism relative to ONC201 in preclinical studies and additionally showed disruption of DRD2 homodimers. Treatment of tumor cells with ONC206 elicits a distinct gene expression as compared to ONC201. ONC206 has demonstrated synergistic in vitro activity with ONC201 in cells that have acquired resistance to ONC201. ONC206 showed anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of difficult-to-treat neuroendocrine tumors and high-grade gliomas. In vitro, ONC206 has affected some of the same downstream pathways as ONC201, including activation of the integrated stress response and inhibition of Ras signaling, leading to selective killing of tumor cells.
The first-in-human clinical trial of ONC206 for adults with recurrent primary central nervous system tumors is ongoing at the National Institute of Health (NCT04541082). 
ONC212
ONC212 is an investigational agonist of the orphan GPCR tumor suppressor GPR132, as well as ClpP. Similar to the potential downstream effects of ONC201 and ONC206, in vitro studies of ONC212 demonstrate activation of integrated stress response, inhibited Ras signaling and selectively killed tumor cells. ONC212 showed broad-spectrum activity across both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including pancreatic cancer and leukemias prioritized as target clinical indications that exhibit high GPR132 and/or ClpP expression.
Currently ONC212 is in IND-enabling studies. If warranted by IND-enabling studies, first-in-human trials are expected to be conducted in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center and Brown University.
Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT)
In July 2019, we entered into a Development and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, with Cantex Pharmaceuticals (Cantex), pursuant to which we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize DSTAT for all indications; the planned lead indication is for the first line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we are responsible for, and bear the costs of, worldwide development and commercialization of DSTAT. As consideration for the exclusive license, Cantex received an upfront payment of $30.0 million and 10.0 million shares of Chimerix stock. Cantex is also eligible to receive milestone payments up to $202.5 million upon the receipt of product approvals in the United States, the European Union and Japan and sales milestone payments up to $385 million upon achievement of specified net sales levels. We also agreed to pay Cantex tiered royalties based on percentage of net sales beginning at 10% and not to exceed the high teens. 
DSTAT for First-Line Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DSTAT is a is a novel therapeutic candidate which inhibits the activities of key proteins implicated in the resistance of AML blasts and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to chemotherapy (e.g., CXCL12, HMGB1, Human Leukocyte Elastase (HLE)). DSTAT also inhibits platelet factor 4 (PF4), which has been demonstrated to play a key role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and impairment of platelet recovery after chemotherapy.
Collectively, DSTAT’s inhibition of these proteins has the potential to benefit patients in three ways:
•Inhibit mechanisms of chemoresistance in AML blasts
•Increase chemosensitivity of leukemic stem cells (LSCs)
•Accelerate platelet recovery following chemotherapy
Preliminary evidence of DSTAT efficacy was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, Phase 2b, dose-finding study (NCT02873338) evaluating DSTAT in combination with standard 7+3 chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone in 75 participants ≥60 years of age with newly diagnosed AML. Observed overall survival (OS) was longer in the DSTAT group (median not reached; median follow-up for survivors was 20 months) than the control group (median 11.7 months [95% CI: 7.6, nc]) (observed hazard ratio [HR] 0.68 [95% CI: 0.29, 1.57]). A subset analysis of participants meeting the target inclusion criteria for the planned Phase 3 study demonstrated a favorable observed HR for DSTAT (N=20) vs control (N=19) for OS of 0.51 [95% CI: 0.19, 1.42]. Combination treatment with 7+3 chemotherapy and DSTAT did not show increased toxicity compared with 7+3 chemotherapy alone, nor did it prolong time to platelet or neutrophil recovery.
The improved outcomes seen in patients given DSTAT combined with chemotherapy may be due to DSTAT inhibition of key proteins resulting in sensitization of low abundance resistant AML blasts and quiescent LSCs to cell cycle-dependent 
chemotherapies. The potential impact on relapse of a deeper and more durable response to chemotherapy treatment is represented graphically in the figure below. 
Figure 1: Schematic representation of leukemic cell counts over time. In the above hypothetical chart, Patients 2 through 5 are all assumed to achieve a complete response or CR (<5% AML blasts in bone marrow based on morphology); however, their long-term response varies from a relatively quick relapse to a potential cure. Measurable residual disease or MRD is a more sensitive analysis of blasts than CR (e.g., 0.1% cutoff for MRD by flow cytometry is typical vs 5% for CR by morphology)
The mechanism of DSTAT efficacy is likely based on the inhibition of multiple proteins involved in chemoresistance and quiescence. This multi-modal mechanism of action may be particularly beneficial in a disease with significant heterogeneity like AML and may provide an advantage relative to other therapies with singular targets (e.g., CXCR4 inhibitors, E-selectin inhibitors). 
DSTAT interaction with the key targets may provide a deeper and more durable response to chemotherapy treatment in AML patients without significant additional toxicity compared to chemotherapy alone. 
In 2020, we conducted an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA related to the Company’s development of DSTAT in AML. Following the meeting, we incorporated FDA's feedback into the full protocol. We recently opened clinical trial sites and are ready to begin screening patients for our 570-subject Phase 3 Dociparstat in AML with Standard Chemotherapy (DASH AML) study of DSTAT for the treatment of AML.
DASH AML is a randomized, double-blinded trial of approximately 570 newly diagnosed AML patients. The trial will include patients 60 years of age and older who have an intermediate or adverse genetic risk profile. It will also include patients between 18 and 60 years old who have an adverse genetic risk profile. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive DSTAT in combination with standard cytarabine plus anthracycline (7+3) induction and cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy or will receive standard of care (7+3) induction and consolidation chemotherapy alone. Patients with FLT-3 mutations will be allowed in the study and will be eligible to receive midostaurin.
The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival (OS). In addition, the FDA has indicated that event-free survival (EFS) using complete response with hematologic recovery to define induction success (CR) may be acceptable as an endpoint for regulatory approval. Other endpoints to be evaluated in the proposed trial include: MRD, relapse-free survival (RFS), time to hematologic recovery, and induction response.
In order to supplement the previously reported data from pilot and Phase 2 studies and provide additional evidence regarding DSTAT’s potential mechanism of action, the proposed Phase 3 trial includes an early assessment of comparative CR and MRD rates among the first 80 evaluable patients. A recently published meta-analysis of 81 separate studies covering 11,151 patients (Short, et. al., Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology, October 8, 2020) has suggested a link between MRD status and outcomes in patients with AML. Specifically, this large cohort meta-analysis showed that MRD-negative AML patients experience superior 5-year disease-free survival (average hazard ratio: 0.37) and 5-year overall survival (average hazard ratio: 0.36) rates when compared to patients that are MRD-positive. This study suggests that evaluation of MRD status 
in AML patients may allow for an earlier assessment of therapeutic effects and could lead to acceleration in the development of novel AML therapeutics.
The data from the first 80 evaluable patients of the proposed Phase 3 trial are expected to be unblinded, reported publicly, and available for ongoing analysis of later endpoints, unless the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) determines that exceptional pre-specified thresholds have been achieved, in which case the DMC will have the discretion to maintain blinding, which would allow inclusion of these patients in the final analysis.
DSTAT has received Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AML. 
DSTAT for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) in COVID-19 Patients
DSTAT is a low anticoagulant heparin derivative which has been shown to modify several key drivers of inflammation and aberrant thrombosis. DSTAT’s proposed mechanism of action is multimodal and may involve inhibition of several proteins (HMGB1, PF4, and P-selectin). These proteins are involved in the hyperinflammation and coagulopathy associated with severe COVID-19, suggesting DSTAT is uniquely positioned as a candidate treatment to address these important aspects of COVID-19 pathophysiology that contribute to high morbidity and mortality.
In April 2020, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2/3 study of DSTAT in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) from COVID-19. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DSTAT in adults with severe COVID-19 who are at high risk of respiratory failure. Eligible subjects will be those with confirmed COVID-19 who require hospitalization and supplemental oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is survival without the need for mechanical ventilation through day 28. Additional endpoints include time to improvement as assessed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) ordinal scale, time to hospital discharge, time to resolution of fever, number of ventilator-free days, all-cause mortality, and changes in key biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, HMGB1, C-reactive protein and d-dimer).
The Phase 2 portion of the study will enroll 24 subjects (12 subjects in each of 2 cohorts with different doses) to determine the maximum tolerated dose and will then expand to a third cohort consisting of approximately 50 patients (74 total) at the selected dose. A formal analysis of all endpoints, including supportive biomarkers will be performed at the conclusion of the Phase 2 portion of the study. Contingent upon positive results from the Phase 2 portion, the Phase 3 portion of the study will enroll approximately 450 subjects. This study is currently enrolling. Due to the complex and rapidly changing landscape of COVID infection rates and institutional standard of care, we cannot predict with certainty when we will complete Phase 2 enrollment. The study protocol allows for the review of data by cohort. 
Topline Results from First Cohort
We have completed enrollment of the first and second cohorts of our DSTAT trial in COVID-19 patients. An analysis of the first cohort that enrolled 12 patients randomized 1:1 was conducted. One patient on DSTAT was ventilated and recovered. Two patients on placebo progressed to ventilation and died, one on day two and the other post day 28. No deaths were reported in patients on the DSTAT arm. 
A secondary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved at least a two-point improvement in the NIAID ordinal scale, an assessment of clinical status. All six DSTAT patients met the improvement criteria compared to two of the six placebo patients as shown in the Kaplan-Meier curve below.
Of note, on day 28 three of the six placebo patients remained hospitalized and one had died. At day 28, one DSTAT patient was hospitalized. Two DSTAT patients who were discharged were subsequently lost to follow-up. 
No patients on DSTAT had elevated values for IL-6, MCP-1 or D-dimer on therapy, but two patients on placebo had substantial increases in all of these biomarkers by day five. One of these placebo patients developed Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome and died after day 28 while the other suffered a pulmonary embolism and recovered. These biomarkers are reflective of the lung inflammation and thrombotic complications associated with severe COVID-19, and these findings are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action for DSTAT. 
DSTAT was observed to be generally safe and well tolerated. No patients on the DSTAT arm discontinued study treatment for adverse events compared to two patients on the placebo arm.
First Cohort Demographics
As an enrollment criterion, all patients were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection and required supplemental oxygen; some patients required more intensive supplemental oxygen (noninvasive ventilation/high-flow oxygen) which is generally associated with more severe disease. 
Five of the six patients on the placebo arm required noninvasive ventilation/high-flow oxygen at baseline, compared to two of the six patients on the DSTAT arm. The median age of patients in cohort one was 63.0 years on the placebo arm and 50.5 years on the DSTAT arm. These random imbalances may favor the DSTAT arm.
The DSTAT arm was comprised of six males. The placebo arm was comprised of four males and two females. Being male has been associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality. 
Second Cohort Enrollment Complete
The Phase 2 portion of the study enrolled two cohorts of 12 patients each to confirm the maximum safe dose with reviews by the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) after completion of each cohort. The second cohort is fully enrolled and the data will be compiled for review by the DSMB. Following review, the DSMB will recommend a dose for the third cohort which will include approximately 50 additional patients (74 total). A formal analysis of all endpoints, including supportive biomarkers will be performed at the conclusion of the third cohort, completing the Phase 2 portion of the study. Contingent upon positive results, the Phase 3 portion of the study will enroll approximately 450 patients.
Our Strategy
The principal components of our business strategy are to:
•Deliver BCV, as a countermeasure for smallpox, to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). In 2020, we submitted an NDA for BCV tablet and an NDA for BCV suspension for the treatment of smallpox. In December 2020, we received notification from the FDA of an April 7, 2021 PDUFA date related to our submissions. 
•Develop ONC201 for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma. ONC201 is currently being evaluated in a registrational program for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant Glioma. Upon full maturation of the data, an evaluation by BICR of a 50-subject registrational cohort is expected later this year. If favorable, this data may form the basis for an accelerated regulatory approval of ONC201 in the United States. In addition to clinical data support preparation, we are also working on drug product and clinical pharmacology support of ONC201 necessary for a pre-NDA meeting. As we gather more information, we expect to have a better understanding of the possible timeframes in which a pre-NDA meeting could take place.
•Develop DSTAT for AML. Following an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in early 2020, we have incorporated FDA's feedback on key elements of a proposed Phase 3 trial in first-line AML patients and have since finalized the protocol with the FDA. In early 2021, we initiated, DASH AML, a Phase 3 trial with a targeted full enrollment of approximately 570 patients with DSTAT in combination with standard chemotherapy (cytarabine plus anthracycline or “7+3”) in newly diagnosed AML patients. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival (OS). The FDA has indicated that event-free survival (EFS) using complete response with hematologic recovery to define induction success (CR), is acceptable as an endpoint for regulatory approval. Other endpoints to be evaluated in the proposed trial include: measurable residual disease (MRD), relapse-free survival (RFS), time to hematologic recovery, and induction response. In order to supplement the previously collected data from the pilot and Phase 2 trials and provide additional evidence of DSTAT’s mechanism of action, the Phase 3 trial includes an early assessment of comparative CR and MRD rates among the first 80 evaluable patients. This data is expected to be unblinded, reported publicly, and available for ongoing analysis of later endpoints. Prior to potential unblinding, this data will be reviewed by an independent DMC. The DMC will have the discretion to maintain blinding of the data from this early assessment in the event the DSTAT arm shows exceptional advantages to the control arm on CR and MRD, at certain pre-specified thresholds, which would allow inclusion of these patients in the final analysis. 
•Develop DSTAT for ALI. In 2020 we initiated a Phase 2/3 study of DSTAT in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) from COVID-19. We have completed enrollment of cohorts 1 and 2 of the Phase 2 portion of the study, cohort 3 will initiate after the DMC meets to review initial safety data from cohort 2. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of subjects who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28. Additional endpoints include time to improvement as assessed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ordinal scale, time to hospital discharge, time to resolution of fever, number of ventilator-free days, all-cause mortality, and changes in key biomarkers (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, HMGB1, C-reactive protein and d-dimer). The Phase 2/3 study includes an assessment of all endpoints and supportive biomarkers in Phase 2 to decide whether to continue to the Phase 3 portion of the study. 
•Seek opportunities to in-license other development programs. We continue to review transactions designed to build our product candidate pipeline, including, but not limited to, merger or acquisition transactions, issuing or transferring shares of common stock, or the license, purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at maximizing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that this review will result in the identification or consummation of any additional transaction.
Significant Agreements 
BARDA
In February 2011, we entered into a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the advanced development of brincidofovir as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. BARDA is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response that supports the advanced research and development, manufacturing, acquisition and stockpiling of medical countermeasures. The scope of work for the contract includes preclinical, clinical and manufacturing development activities that fall into the following areas: non-clinical animal efficacy studies; clinical activities; manufacturing activities; and all associated regulatory, quality assurance, management, and administrative activities.
Under the contract, BARDA reimburses our costs, plus pays us a fixed fee, for the research and development of brincidofovir as a treatment of smallpox infections. The contract consists of an initial performance period, referred to as the base performance 
segment which ended on May 31, 2013, plus up to four extension periods, referred to as option segments, each of which may be exercised at BARDA’s sole discretion. We must complete agreed upon milestones and deliverables in each discrete work segment before the next option segment is eligible to be exercised. Under the contract as currently in effect, if each follow-on option segment is exercised by BARDA, we may receive up to $75.8 million in expense reimbursement and $5.3 million in fees.
We substantially completed the first option segment of the contract on August 28, 2014. In September 2014, we were awarded a contract extension for a second option segment providing an additional $17.0 million. In August 2016, the contract was amended to provide an additional $535,000, in December 2017 the contract was amended to increase funding by an additional $4.1 million, and in January 2019 the contract was amended to increase funding by an additional $2.3 million for the performance of the second option segment. The second option segment was completed on August 20, 2020. On September 11, 2015, BARDA exercised the third option segment, which provided approximately $12.9 million in funding for the performance of the segment. In December 2017, BARDA decreased the scope of this segment by removing a potential second pivotal ectromelia virus study which decreased the funding of this option segment by $1.3 million to a total award of $11.6 million; the third option segment was completed on August 20, 2020. On June 17, 2020, BARDA exercised the fourth option segment, which provided approximately $4.6 million in funding for the performance of the segment. Of the $75.8 million expense reimbursement and $5.3 million in fees that we may receive, approximately $78.9 million in expense reimbursement and fees has been funded. As of December 31, 2020, of the $78.9 of total funding, we had invoiced an aggregate of $75.5 million with respect to the base performance segment and four option segments.
Pursuant to the contract, Chimerix and the U.S. government share the rights to any inventions made in the performance of our work under the contract. Specifically, the U.S. government retains a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid up license to any invention made in the performance of our work under the contract, provided, however, that the U.S. government may, under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving public health and safety, license such inventions to third parties without our consent. There have been no inventions made to date under the BARDA contract.
The contract may be terminated by BARDA ten days after giving us notice of a material default which remains uncured for ten days. In addition, BARDA is also permitted under applicable law to terminate the contract if it is in the U.S. government’s best interest.
There are no RFPs for procurement of a smallpox antiviral pertaining to brincidofovir that are currently pending.
In the event a new RFP is issued we will likely submit a proposal. In the event that our proposal is chosen (potentially among several competing proposals) and before we can enter into a contract we must negotiate its terms, including the price and delivery schedule. In addition, as a governmental agency, BARDA’s ability to enter into a contract is subject to continued funding for this purpose, which can change at any time. 
License and Development Agreement with Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
On July 26, 2019, the Company entered into a License and Development Agreement with Cantex pursuant to which the Company acquired exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize, for any and all uses, a glycosaminoglycan compound known as DSTAT, which is currently being studied for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company is responsible for, and bears the costs of, worldwide development and commercialization of DSTAT. In connection with the transaction, Cantex assigned to the Company all of its rights under its DSTAT supply agreements, including its bulk API agreement with Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL), pursuant to which SPL will exclusively produce DSTAT for the Company through October 2040.
In consideration for the license rights, the Company made an upfront cash payment of $30.0 million to Cantex and issued to Cantex 10.0 million shares of its common stock. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $65.0 million of acquired in-process research and development expenses for the $30.0 million upfront cash payment, the fair value of the 10.0 million shares of common stock issued to Cantex and $0.1 million of transaction costs. The license agreement obligates the Company to pay Cantex regulatory milestone payments of up to $202.5 million upon receipt of product approvals in the United States, the European Union and Japan, and sales milestone payments of up to $385.0 million upon achievement of specified net sales levels. The Company also agreed to pay Cantex tiered royalties based on percentages of net sales beginning at 10% and not to exceed the high teens.
SymBio Pharmaceuticals
On September 30, 2019, the Company entered into a license agreement with Symbio for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize BCV for all human indications, excluding the prevention and treatment of orthopoxviruses, including smallpox. Under the terms of the license agreement, SymBio will be responsible for, and bear the future costs of, worldwide development and commercialization of BCV in the licensed indications. Either party may terminate the license agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party (subject to standard cure periods), or upon certain events involving the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. SymBio may also terminate the license agreement without cause on a country-by-country basis upon ninety days' prior notice.
In exchange for the license to BCV rights, the Company received an upfront payment of $5.0 million in October of 2019. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive up to $180.0 million in clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones worldwide, as well as low double-digit royalties and additional milestones based on commercial sales. Since entering into the license agreement in September 2019, the Company has recognized all of the $5.0 million of revenue related to the upfront payment.
Merger Agreement with Oncoceutics Inc, and Fortis Advisors
On January 7, 2021, we entered into an agreement with the securityholders of Oncoceutics and Fortis Advisors (as securityholders representative) to acquire Oncoceutics, a privately-held, clinical-stage biotechnology company developing imipridones, a novel potential class of compounds. As consideration for the acquisition, we (a) paid an upfront cash payment of approximately $25.0 million, (b) issued an aggregate of 8,723,769 shares of our common stock, (c) issued a promissory note to the representative of the securityholders of Oncoceutics in the principal amount of $14.0 million, to be paid in cash, upon the one year anniversary of the closing of the acquisition, and (d) agreed to make contingent payments up to an aggregate of $360.0 million based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercialization events, as well as additional tiered royalty payments based upon future net sales of ONC-201 and ONC-206 products, subject to certain reductions, and a contingent payment in the event we receive any proceeds from the sale of a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher based on the Oncoceutics products. We have also passed through to the Oncoceutics securityholders the upfront payment received from China Resources Sanjiu Medical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. pursuant to a license agreement entered into with Oncoceutics prior to the acquisition. The closing payment may be adjusted after the closing, pursuant to procedures, in connection with the finalization of the cash, transaction expenses, debt and working capital amounts at closing. Pursuant to the merger agreement we have certain diligence obligations with respect to further development and commercialization of the Oncoceutics product candidates.
Commercial Operations
In 2020, we submitted an NDA for BCV tablet and an NDA for BCV suspension for the treatment of smallpox. In December, 2020, we received notification from the FDA of an April 7, 2021 PDUFA date related to our submissions. The U.S. government is the largest source of development and procurement funding for academic and biopharmaceutical companies contracting biodefense research or developing vaccines, anti-infectives and immunotherapies directed at potential agents of bioterror or biowarfare. U.S. government spending on biodefense programs includes development funding awarded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BARDA and the Department of Defense (DoD), and procurement of countermeasures by BARDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the DoD. In addition to the U.S. government, we believe that potential additional markets for the sale of biodefense countermeasures include:
•foreign governments, including both defense and public health agencies;
•non-governmental organizations and multinational companies, including transportation and security companies;
•healthcare providers, including hospitals and clinics; and
•state and local governments, which may be interested in these products to protect, among others, emergency responders, such as police, fire and emergency medical personnel.
If BCV is approved by the FDA, it is not expected to be approved for sale beyond the Strategic National Stockpile. The Company would likely need to meet additional regulatory requirements before sales were made in the U.S. beyond the Strategic National Stockpile.
If ONC201 is approved for recurrent H3 K27M-mutant glioma and/or DSTAT is approved for the treatment of AML, we believe it is possible for us to commercialize ONC201 and DSTAT in the United States. We anticipate that commercialization of one or both products would entail a relatively small commercial infrastructure, which may include a contract sales force, partner sales force, or an internally developed commercial organization. 
Outside of the United States, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we may seek to commercialize ONC201 and DSTAT ourselves or through distribution or other collaboration arrangements. If we elect to develop ONC201 for other indications and if DSTAT is also developed for other hematologic indications, we would plan to do so selectively either on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs, reimbursement complexities and our available resources.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our therapeutic experience, scientific and commercial knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we will face competition from large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and other emerging technologies.
We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of BCV, ONC201, DSTAT and our other product candidates are the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile and the risk-benefit trade-off compared to alternative therapies or procedures. Securing market access and reimbursement will be an important element of product uptake and market penetration. Our commercial opportunity could be negatively impacted if our competitors develop or market products or other technologies that are more effective, better tolerated, safer, more convenient or have greater market access than BCV, ONC201 and DSTAT, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. In addition, our ability to compete will be affected by the availability of generic products.
ONC201 is the most clinically advanced program for potentially treating tumors which harbor the H3 K27M mutation in recurrent diffuse midline glioma patients. If approved, treatment with ONC201 is expected to be targeted to patients whose tumor harbors the H3 K27M mutation. There are currently no commercially available treatments that target the H3 K27M mutant patient population. 
If approved, ONC201 could compete with a number of existing products, new products in development and possible combination therapies used for brain cancers including generic drugs such as chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapies, and other therapies. Select products that are currently used, or being developed for use, to treat brain cancers include, but are not limited to:
•Systemic therapies approved to treat brain cancer: temozolomide, lomustine, carmustine, everolimus, and bevacizumab 
•Tumor-treating fields such as Optune®
•Other investigational agents for the treatment of brain cancer: immunotherapies (CAR-T, durvalumab, VBI-1901, etc), viral therapies (DCVax-L, etc.), targeted agents (panobinostat, paxalisib, MDNA55) and other therapies 
If approved, DSTAT would compete with a number of existing products, new products in development and other types of combination therapies in development for first line AML including generic drugs such as standard 7+3 (cytarabine plus anthracycline) chemotherapy, alternative non-chemo based therapy regimens and other 7+3 combination therapies that target specific mutations. Select products that are currently used, or being developed for use, to treat AML include but are not limited to:
•Standard 7+3 (cytarabine plus anthracycline) with or without targeted agents (including but not limited to the experimental treatment uproleselan, Mylotarg®, IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors (enasidenib and ivosidenib), FLT-3 inhibitors (midostaurin and gilteritinib), and other targeted agents such as gemtuzumab, glasdegib, and venetoclax));
•Vyxeos® and combinations with Vyxeos;
•Hypomethylating agents or low dose cytarabine with or without venetoclax; and
•Other consolidation and maintenance therapies (including hypomethylating agents, venetoclax, and stem cell transplantation).
Clinical trials with these alternatives have the potential to compete for and thus slow enrollment in the DSTAT clinical development program, with resulting impacts on the time to Phase 3 results (and thus time to market). Competition for patients and/or evolutions in the standard of care could render the completion of Phase 3 clinical development not feasible. Even if DSTAT clinical trials are successful, we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market, as advanced technologies become available and as increasing numbers of generic formulations of currently branded products become available.
Changes in the health care system may limit our ability to price BCV, ONC201, DSTAT and our other product candidates at a level that would allow recovery of our research and development costs and may impede our ability to generate or maintain a profit.
We believe that BCV, ONC201, and DSTAT have potential benefits over existing and potential competitive products as described in more detail under “Business - ONC201”, “Business - Dociparstat sodium” and “Business - Brincidofovir”, respectively. As a result, we believe that these products should be well positioned to gain adoption if we obtain the required regulatory approvals. However, even with those benefits, we may not be able to make promotional claims that these products are superior to competing products without conducting additional studies, which delivers differentiated data. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates.”
Our Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies we believe are important to our business, including by seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain licenses to our intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
Antiviral Patent Portfolio
At February 15, 2021, our worldwide antiviral patent portfolio included:
•74 patents or patent applications that we own or have in-licensed from academic institutions, related to brincidofovir, and other antivirals, which represented a decrease over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of fiscal year 2019;
•This includes 53 US and foreign exclusively and jointly owned patents and 21 US and foreign applications related to brincidofovir, and other antivirals. Granted European and Eurasian patents are counted as one patent and have been validated throughout Europe and Eurasia;
•Four jointly-owned patents and two jointly-owned patent applications related to our agreement with UM regarding our proprietary Chemical Library; and
•One US and one European patent application exclusively owned by Chimerix directed to a morphic form of a compound from the Chemical Library.
In 2015, U.S. Patent No. 8,962,829 covering a method of synthesis and the commercial morphic form of brincidofovir was issued to Chimerix. With the addition of this patent, composition of matter coverage for brincidofovir in the U.S. is expected to extend to October 2034, excluding any additional term from patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
DSTAT Patent Portfolio
•40 patents or patent applications that we own or have in-licensed from Cantex, related to DSTAT;
•This includes 24 US and foreign issued patents and 16 pending US and foreign applications related to DSTAT;
•Patent protection for DSTAT is expected to extend through 2033, with the potential for 2038 in the U.S. in the event of full patent term restoration.
Oncoceutics Patent Portfolio
•156 patents or patent applications related to imipridones that we have acquired rights to through our merger with Oncoceutics, Inc. (owned or in-licensed by Oncoceutics);
•This includes 29 US and foreign issued patents and 70 pending US and foreign applications related to ONC201;
•Patent protection for ONC201's lead indication is expected to extend into 2037 in the U.S., with the potential for 2042 in the U.S. in the event of full patent term restoration.
Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our lipid-antiviral-conjugate technology platform and the Chimerix Chemical Library, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our antivirals, upon appropriate regulatory approvals, in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to the conduct of our business as a whole.
We also seek to expand our intellectual property portfolio through licensing intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have granted, and will continue to grant to others, licenses under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. In the past, we have relied on third-party manufacturers for supply of our product candidates, ONC201, DSTAT and BCV, as well as our other product candidates. 
We expect that in the future we will rely on such manufacturers for supply of drug substance and drug product that will be used in clinical trials of DSTAT, our expanded access program for ONC201 and other clinical trials as well as for commercial purposes should ONC201, DSTAT or BCV be approved. In July 2019, we were assigned Cantex’s rights under a supply agreement with Scientific Protein Labs (SPL) pursuant to which SPL will exclusively produce DSTAT drug substance for us through October 2040 (the Supply Agreement). We have agreed that SPL will be our exclusive provider of DSTAT during the term of the Supply Agreement. In addition, in July 2019 we were assigned Cantex’s rights under a supply agreement with Pyramid Laboratories Inc. (Pyramid) pursuant to which Pyramid will provide DSTAT finished drug product to us. When produced on a commercial scale, we expect that cost-of-goods-sold relating to ONC201, DSTAT and BCV will generally be in-line with that of other targeted oncology therapies, heparin-derived molecules and small-molecule pharmaceutical compounds, respectively.
The manufacturing process for brincidofovir drug substance is relatively straight-forward and generally in-line with other small molecule pharmaceutical compounds in terms of cost and complexity. The process is robust and reproducible, does not require dedicated reactors or specialized equipment, uses common synthetic chemistry and readily available materials, including off-the-shelf and made-to-order starting materials, and is readily transferable.
Our current drug substance supply chain for brincidofovir involves various contractors that supply the raw materials for the drug substance process, a contract manufacturer for an intermediate, and a contract manufacturer for the drug substance. We have a validated large-scale drug substance manufacturing process at our selected contractor that will produce the potential procurement supply of drug substance. Manufacturers of drug components must meet certain FDA qualifications with respect to manufacturing standards. At present, we have qualified only one firm as a supplier of drug substance. We continually assess our manufacturing needs and may seek to engage additional qualified vendors as circumstances dictate. Changes in our requirements may require revalidation of the manufacturing process at a different scale and potentially at a different contractor depending on the necessary scale, infrastructure and technical capabilities. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate.
Our BCV drug products (tablets and oral suspension) are also manufactured by contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). The CDMOs must meet certain FDA qualifications with respect to manufacturing standards. Manufacturers for each product have been selected and qualified with registration and validation batches to support NDA marketing applications with the FDA. In addition, scale up of both the tablet and suspension products is in progress that will produce potential procurement supplies. 
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our systems and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and this is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and government authorities of member states of the EU and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA or EMA before it may be legally marketed in the United States or EU and in other countries by the responsible national regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, FDA approval process or after FDA approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action, whether before or after the FDA approval process, could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (GLP), or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practices (GCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a NDA for a new drug;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and FDA review of the NDA.
The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or affected patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Patients not meeting protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria may be considered for our expanded access program under the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board 
(IRB), at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1.   The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2.   The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3.   Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to determine if they are substantially complete before it accepts them for filing; this initial review period prior to accepting the NDA for filing is 2 months in duration. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months from the date of accepting the NDA for filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended if the FDA 
requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission without prior agreement reached at a pre-submission meeting.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements. If major issues with trial conduct are identified at a site, data collected from that site can be determined to be unacceptable for supporting the application. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Orphan Drug Designation
Our investigational agent, ONC201 has been granted an orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioblastoma and for the treatment of malignant glioma. DSTAT also has orphan drug designation for the treatment of AML. In addition, BCV has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of smallpox. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the 
same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a number of programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products for serious conditions that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and/or Priority Review designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Our investigational agents, ONC201, DSTAT and BCV, have been granted Fast Track designation. In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had accepted the filing of the NDA for BCV as a medical countermeasure for smallpox, granted Priority Review and set an action date of April 7, 2021 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).
Breakthrough Therapy designation is for a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. 
Unique to Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy products, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy programs, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-review of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track, Breakthrough, and Priority Review designations and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Emergency Use Authorization
The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority allows FDA to facilitate availability and unapproved uses of medical countermeasures (MCMs) needed to prepare for and respond to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) emergencies. The EUA authority is separate from use of a drug under an investigational application (IND). As a first step, the Secretary of HHS makes the declaration of emergency or threat justifying authorization of emergency use. Then the FDA Commissioner authorizes the emergency use of an unapproved medical product or an unapproved use of an approved medical product for certain emergency circumstances. This allows an MCM to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by a CBRN agent when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. A formal request to issue an EUA is generally submitted by government sponsors (e.g., HHS or the Department of Defense (DoD)) but not until the Secretary of HHS has issued the declaration. An EUA request includes a summary of the available scientific evidence regarding the product's safety and effectiveness, risks (including an adverse event profile) and benefits, and any available, approved alternatives to the product. Also included are manufacturing information and Fact sheets which are comparable to an FDA-approved package insert.
Animal Efficacy Rule
FDA permits the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from clinical trial(s) in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, which are known as the “Animal Rule”, authorize the FDA to rely on animal studies to provide evidence of a product’s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the activity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with the FDA’s prior agreement, drugs used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated under this rule must demonstrate effectiveness through pivotal animal studies, which are generally equivalent in design and robustness to Phase 3 clinical studies. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. Safety under this rule is established under preexisting requirements, including safety studies in both animals (toxicology) and humans. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products for which we or our strategic alliance partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising agreements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Our strategic alliance partners may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such strategic alliance partner. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the 
FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
US Health Care Laws
Our operations may be subject to federal and state health care laws and regulations including, without limitation: anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, patient data privacy and security laws, and health care professional payment transparency laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Reimbursement / Health Reform 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including prescription drugs. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved prescription drugs and other healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow the sale of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved on a competitive and profitable basis.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities to provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each Part D prescription drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all of the drugs within each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, although the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Accordingly, any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Currently, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs. However, the U.S. Congress may in the future consider legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research would be developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures would be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear whether research would have any effect on the sales of any of our products that are successfully developed and approved, if the product or the condition that it is intended to treat becomes the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA was enacted in an effort to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. However, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. Legislation enacted in 2017 (H.R. 1, “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018”), informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, and also increases in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent to 70 percent. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact ACA.
If not preempted by the ACA, several states and local jurisdictions require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing related activities. Still other states require the posting of 
information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, some states, such as California, Nevada and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. In addition, certain states and local jurisdictions require registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, including several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Such reform efforts are likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their respective national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products for which we receive marketing approval. Historically, the price structures for products launched in the EU do not follow those of the United States and tend to be significantly lower.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our strategic alliance partners will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA), must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the particular clinical trial may proceed. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is expected to take effect in 2020, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA or a Biologics License Application in the United States is similar to the application dossier (eCTD) required in the EU.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
EU Review and Approval Process

In the EU, there are two main routes for authorizing the marketing of medicines, a centralized route and a national route. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicinal products which are produced by biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and for those which are designated as orphan medicinal products. Besides the products falling under the mandatory scope, the centralized procedure is also optional for medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation i.e. new active substances or other medicinal products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, that contain an active substance not authorized in the European Union before May 20, 2004 or for which a centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients.
Under the centralized authorization procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing-authorization application to the EMA. EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) carries out a scientific assessment of the application and makes a recommendation to the European Commission whether the medicine should be marketed or not. If authorization is granted by the European Commission, the centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. 
Additionally, medicines that belong to at least one of the below categories may be granted a conditional market authorization (CMA). 
A CMA may be granted if: (1) the CHMP finds that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data, (3) the unmet medical needs will be fulfilled, and (4) the benefit to public health of the medicinal product’s immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data.
CMAs are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The CMA holder will be required to complete specific obligations (to complete ongoing or new studies, and in some cases additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the CMA may be converted into a full marketing authorization (not subject to specific obligations). Initially, this is valid for five years, but can be renewed for unlimited validity.
Orphan Designation in the EU
In order to qualify for Orphan Designation, a medicine must meet the following criteria:
•it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;
•the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and
•no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
EMA is responsible for reviewing applications from sponsors for orphan designation. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), through its network of experts, examines applications for Orphan Designation and issues an 
opinion to EMA. The evaluation process takes approximately of 90 days from validation. Once EMA receives COMP’s opinion, EMA sends it to the European Commission, which is responsible for granting the Orphan Designation. 
At the time a sponsor of a marketing application files for marketing authorization for a medicine that has received Orphan Designation, the sponsor must also submit a report on the maintenance of the Orphan Designation in parallel. EMA uses this report to determine whether the medicine can maintain its status as an orphan medicine and benefit from the extended market exclusivity applicable to orphan products. Market exclusivity is linked to the maintenance of the Orphan Designation when the medicine receives a marketing authorization for the indication concerned.
If it is determined that a medicine still meets the criteria for Orphan Designation at the time of marketing approval, that medicine may benefit from a period of ten years market exclusivity in the EU. This incentive is intended to protect orphan medicines from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved, and fundamentally to encourage the development of medicines for rare diseases.
The applicant is obliged to submit an annual report to the EMA every year after their medicine has been granted orphan designation. The annual report needs provide information on the status of the development of the medicine, such as a review of ongoing clinical studies, a description of the investigation plan for the coming year and any anticipated or current problems in the process, difficulties in testing and potential changes that may have an impact on the medicine’s orphan designation. 
The European Commission is responsible for granting market exclusivity for orphan medicines. Market exclusivity is linked to each specific Orphan Designation for which a marketing authorization has been granted. 
The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that also have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP). Each orphan designation for a product linked to a separate orphan condition is eligible for a two-year extension if this is accounted for in the PIP. The extension is granted by the European Commission based on the positive compliance check from the Pediatric Committee and opinion from the CHMP.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom, or UK, voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit” and the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. The United Kingdom and the EU are currently in a transition period during which the United Kingdom and the EU are negotiating additional arrangements, including their future trading arrangement. The United Kingdom has stated that it wants the transition period to expire, and the future trading terms to be agreed, by December 31, 2020. 
Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, immediately following Brexit, it is expected that the United Kingdom’s regulatory regime will remain aligned with EU regulations. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. In the longer term, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 54 full-time employees. Of these employees, 39 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 15 employees are engaged in finance, legal, human resources, facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2021 with a focus on expanding our expertise and bandwidth in clinical and preclinical research and development. We continually evaluate our business needs and opportunities and balance in house expertise and capacity with external expertise and capacity. Currently, we rely on third-party contract manufacturers.
Our Culture. The success of our human capital management investments is evidenced by our low employee turnover, a number which is regularly reviewed by our Board of Directors as part of their oversight of our human capital strategy. 
Employee Engagement, Talent Development & Benefits. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development through programs as well as offer tuition reimbursement. 
Diversity & Inclusion. Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values
