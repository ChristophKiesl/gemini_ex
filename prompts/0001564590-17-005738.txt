Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
 We are a biotechnology company focused on novel oncology (cancer) and hematology (blood disease) therapeutics to meaningfully improve patients’ lives. Our core technology is the ADAPTIR™ (modular protein technology) platform. We have four revenue-generating products in the areas of hematology and infectious diseases, as well as various investigational stage product candidates in immuno-oncology. 
 On August 6, 2015, Emergent BioSolutions Inc., (Emergent or Former Parent), announced a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. To accomplish this separation, Emergent created Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. or Aptevo, to be the parent company for the development-based biotechnology business focused on novel oncology and hematology therapeutics. Aptevo was incorporated in Delaware in February 2016 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Emergent. To effect the separation, Emergent made a pro rata distribution of Aptevo’s common stock to Emergent’s stockholders on August 1, 2016. We are currently trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “APVO.” 
 Our pipeline is composed of marketed products for hematology and infectious disease indications and investigational stage candidates based on our ADAPTIR platform, primarily focused on immuno-oncology indications. Our investigational stage product candidates MOR209/ES414 and otlertuzumab and our preclinical candidates, ES210, APVO436, and a proof of concept bispecific immunotherapeutic protein targeting ROR1 are built on our novel ADAPTIR platform, which is designed to expand on the utility and effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies. The platform can be used to produce monospecific, bispecific and multispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets, which we believe provide structural and functional advantages over monoclonal antibodies. The mechanisms of action for MOR209/ES414, ES210, APVO436, otlertuzumab and a proof of concept bispecific immunotherapeutic protein targeting ROR1 include direct tumor cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-cytotoxicity, redirected T-cell cytotoxicity, or RTCC, and targeted cytokine delivery. The structural differences of ADAPTIR molecules over monoclonal antibodies allow for the development of other ADAPTIR immunotherapeutics that engage immune effector cells and disease targets in a novel manner to produce unique signaling responses. We are skilled at product candidate generation, validation and subsequent pre-clinical and clinical development using the ADAPTIR platform. We intend to progress ADAPTIR molecules from concept to marketed product by way of our protein engineering, pre-clinical development, process development and CRO management, cGMP manufacturing oversight and clinical development capabilities. We also expect to have the ability to launch, market and commercialize these product candidates upon approval and might also use contracted resources to augment our capabilities.

 STRATEGY
 We seek to grow our business by, among other things: 
 Advancing our ADAPTIR platform, initially focusing on immunotherapy and the development of novel bispecific proteins for the treatment of cancer. We focus on product development using our ADAPTIR platform. We are developing the MOR209/ES414 ADAPTIR bispecific program in collaboration with MorphoSys, with the goal of commercializing the product in North America. We plan to generate additional bispecific protein immunotherapies for early development, potentially with other collaborative partners, to further validate the potential of the ADAPTIR platform. We intend to favor the development of bispecific candidates that have the potential to demonstrate proof of concept early in development and are differentiated from other strategies in key oncology indications. We expect to continue to expand the ADAPTIR product pipeline to address areas of unmet medical need. Bispecifics and multispecific ADAPTIR proteins will be generated to target tumors using the immune system or direct cytokine delivery to selective cell populations. We believe these product candidates may have utility in oncology, autoimmune disease and other therapeutic areas. 
 Continuing to develop new products. We are committed to new product development. We have expertise in molecular biology, antibody engineering and the development of protein therapeutics, including cell line development, protein purification, process development and analytical characterization. We believe that these core areas of expertise enable the development of therapeutics based on the ADAPTIR platform technology from design, pre-clinical testing, and clinical development to preparation of a biologics license application, or BLA. 
 Establishing collaborative partnerships to broaden our pipeline and provide funding for research and development. We intend to continue to develop and grow our product portfolio through internal research and development as well as through collaborations potentially with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academia and non-governmental organizations. 
 
Supporting the future growth of our pipeline by maximizing the financial contribution of our hyperimmune products and IXINITY. We intend to continue to maximize the financial contribution of our hyperimmune products, WinRho, HepaGam B, VARIZIG and IXINITY for the purpose of funding our research and development efforts. This may require further investments.

PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO 
 Platform Technology 
 ADAPTIR Platform. The platform can be used to produce monospecific, bispecific and multispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets and receptors found on immune cells to mediate tumor killing and improve disease response by modulating the immune cells directly or immune environment. We believe we are well positioned for the development of bispecific therapeutics, which are antibody-based molecules that are able to bind multiple targets of therapeutic interest, utilizing our innovative ADAPTIR (modular protein technology) platform. This allows us to take a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy. 
 Structurally, ADAPTIR molecules are similar to antibodies; they can exhibit the same biological functions of an antibody, but can be easily modified to either eliminate or incorporate new activities, all the while maintaining a similar size, stability and manufacturing advantages of a monoclonal antibody. The ADAPTIR molecules are single-chain polypeptides comprising customized elements including a protein domain that binds to one or more target binding domains to a hinged domain and a set of antibody constant domains known as the fragment crystallizable region, or Fc region of a human antibody. The antibody Fc region can elicit an immune response by binding to the corresponding Fc receptors found on various immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, and other cells, including cancer cells to mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity resulting in killing of the cancer cell. With the ADAPTIR platform, the Fc region can be modified to enhance or eliminate these functions. Incorporation of the Fc region into the ADAPTIR platform also provides for an extended serum half-life by engaging recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). A long serum half-life could potentially reduce dosing frequency and dose quantity. 
 Multispecific ADAPTIR molecules are similar in structure to monospecific ADAPTIR molecules with the exception that they have two or more customized target binding domains on the ends of the Fc region. Multiple targeting domains allow ADAPTIR molecules to bind to two or more targets. We have created several bispecific molecules that are able to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity. T-cells are white blood cells that fight infections and tumor cells. RTCC ADAPTIR molecules cause T-cells to specifically kill a tumor by binding to a common component (CD3) found on the T-cell and then binding to a specific tumor antigen on a specific tumor, activating a T-cell to kill the tumor.

We believe the ADAPTIR platform is a promising platform technology within the rapidly growing field of immuno-oncology therapeutics. The structural differences between ADAPTIR molecules and monoclonal antibodies, allow for the development of new immunotherapeutics that engage disease targets in a novel manner and produce a unique signaling response. By customizing the binding domains of our ADAPTIR molecules, we are able to select for desired potency, half-life, toxicity and stability/manufacturability. We have the potential to develop products with mechanisms of action including but not limited to RTCC and targeted cytokine delivery. We believe the ADAPTIR platform may prove to have advantages over other immunotherapeutics and other bispecific T-cell engaging technologies. In particular, in pre-clinical studies, we have gathered data indicating that MOR209/ES414 may have high potency and activity at low doses, a long half-life, and reduced cytokine release. This molecule is able to be produced using standard manufacturing practices. Further clinical and preclinical studies may not confirm or establish the anticipated benefits of this platform.
 We own all ADAPTIR platform intellectual property except that we have a non-exclusive research license with Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, for certain Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cell lines, which are cells derived from the ovary of a Chinese hamster. The CHO is often used in the production of therapeutic proteins, in protein expression and the GS (glutamine synthetase) Gene Expression SystemTM, or GS System. See section entitled “Intellectual Property” for additional information about the ownership rights to ADAPTIR.

IXINITY (coagulation factor IX (recombinant)). IXINITY is a third-generation recombinant human coagulation factor IX approved in the United States for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and for perioperative management in adults and children 12 years of age or older with hemophilia B. Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, is a rare, inherited bleeding disorder. The blood of hemophilia B patients has an impaired clotting ability, which results from substantially reduced or missing factor IX activity. Patients with hemophilia B commonly experience joint bleeding with pain and swelling, which can result in irreversible joint damage. They may also experience more serious or life-threatening hemorrhages. People with hemophilia B require factor IX injections to restore normal blood coagulation temporarily. Many patients use regular, prophylactic treatment to try to prevent bleeding episodes, while others use on-demand treatment to control bleeding episodes after they occur. Treatment selection and approach is individualized based on factors including the patient’s condition and age, factor level severity, bleeding pattern, activity level and individual pharmacokinetic parameters.
 WinRho SDF Rho(D) Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human). WinRho SDF is made from human plasma and is comprised of purified polyclonal human immune globulins that bind to red blood cells that are positive for Rho(D) (also known as Rho(D)(+) red blood cells). WinRho SDF is approved in the United States and Canada to treat an autoimmune platelet disorder called ITP, a disease characterized by both platelet destruction mediated by autoantibodies and impaired platelet production. ITP can be either short-lived or chronic and symptoms can vary from mild bruising to serious bleeding such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intracranial hemorrhage. WinRho SDF is also approved in the United States and Canada to prevent Rh immunization in Rho(D) negative mothers not previously sensitized to Rho(D) factor. This prevents the development of Rh antibodies in the mother thereby preventing hemolytic disease of the newborn, or HDN, in which the mother’s immune system attacks a Rh-positive newborn’s red blood cells.
 HepaGam B Hepatitis B Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human). HepaGam B is comprised of purified polyclonal human immune globulins that are directed to the hepatitis B surface antigen, which is a protein found on the surface of the hepatitis B virus and in the blood or serum of hepatitis B infected individuals. In the United States, Canada, Israel, Kuwait and Turkey, HepaGam B has been approved for two indications: for the prevention of hepatitis B reinfection after liver transplantation and for use following exposure to the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B is a chronic infection and a major global health concern; up to 2.2 million individuals in the United States and an estimated 240 million people worldwide are chronically infected. Chronic infection can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and even death, so prevention of hepatitis B infection is an important public health issue. In addition, prior to the availability of hepatitis B immune globulin such as HepaGam B and antivirals, liver transplantation was associated with poor survival, HepaGam B is the first hepatitis B immune globulin product to be licensed in the United States for the liver transplant-related indication.

VARIZIG Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin Human. VARIZIG is comprised of purified polyclonal human immune globulins directed to the varicella zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox. While most North American adults have developed immunity to chickenpox, certain at-risk patient populations may be susceptible to infection. VARIZIG is approved in the United States to reduce the severity of varicella (chickenpox) following exposure in high-risk patient groups, including adults and children with compromised immune systems, newborns of mothers with varicella shortly before or after delivery, neonates and infants less than one year of age, and pregnant women. VARIZIG has orphan drug exclusivity in the United States through December 2019. In Canada, VARIZIG is approved for the prevention and reduction of severity in maternal infections within four days of exposure to varicella zoster virus. 
 Product Candidates 
 Our pipeline includes investigational stage product candidates in immune-oncology.
 MOR209/ES414. MOR209/ES414 is a targeted immunotherapeutic protein under development for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, currently in Phase 1 clinical development. MOR209/ES414, a bispecific protein, was constructed using our ADAPTIR platform technology. It activates host T-cells to specifically kill tumor cells expressing prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, an enzyme that is commonly overexpressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. MOR209/ES414 contains two pairs of binding domains, one targeting the CD3 of the TCR complex and one targeting PSMA on tumor cells; these binding domains are linked to opposite ends of an antibody Fc region which extends the serum half-life and enables use of a purification process typical of antibodies. In pre-clinical studies, MOR209/ES414 has been shown to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity towards prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA. In December 2015, after a joint review of data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study of MOR209/ES414 in prostate cancer patients, Aptevo and MorphoSys concluded that the dosing regimen and administration required adjustment. See the section entitled “Collaborations and Licenses” for additional information about our collaboration with MorphoSys to develop MOR209/ES414.
 ES210. ES210 is an anti-inflammatory molecule engineered using our ADAPTIR platform technology currently in pre-clinical development. It is under development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease, and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. ES210 is a targeted cytokine therapeutic, specifically, it is designed to deliver a modified form of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, to antigen presenting cells, or APCs, that express CD86. APCs are a therapeutic target of interest for an anti-inflammatory therapeutic such as ES210 because, as described further below, APCs play a critical role in the immune response. Structurally, ES210 contains a modified form of IL-10, coupled to binding sites specific for CD86, linked by an antibody Fc region. The mechanism of action results in suppression of T-cell responses through inhibition of antigen presentation. Antigen presenting cells play a central role in the generation and regulation of immune response and inflammation; therefore, inhibiting their function represents a therapeutic opportunity to suppress immunopathological processes in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. ES210 preclinical data demonstrate potent in vitro and in vivo antagonism of T-cell proliferation in human mixed lymphocyte reactions and in a humanized graft-versus-host disease model. Humanized refers to chemically altering animal proteins to resemble natural human amino acid sequences (or the order in which they bond). The ES210 ADAPTIR molecule also has potential anti-inflammation applications in rheumatoid arthritis and in the treatment of transplant rejection. As a molecule designed using our ADAPTIR platform technology, the ES210 half-life is extended as demonstrated in preclinical rodent studies. Also, manufacturing benefits are realized because the platform enables use of a purification process that is typically used for making antibodies. 
 otlertuzumab. Otlertuzumab is a monospecific protein therapeutic intended for the treatment of CLL. CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow and is caused by B-cells within the blood and bone marrow that abnormally proliferate and die. Otlertuzumab is a humanized anti-CD37 monospecific protein therapeutic built using the ADAPTIR platform technology. It specifically binds to CD37, a receptor found on malignant B-cells. It functions like an antibody by direct killing of tumor and also engages natural killer cells, which are lymphocytes of the immune system, and other effector cells to kill the tumor cell. We believe that otlertuzumab’s novel properties may provide patients with improved therapeutic options and enhanced efficacy when used in combination with chemotherapy or other targeted therapeutics.
 7


We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of otlertuzumab and bendamustine (a chemotherapy agent) versus bendamustine alone in people with relapsed CLL (Study 16201). In that study the combination of otlertuzumab and bendamustine was superior to bendamustine alone. The combination was well tolerated with significantly increased response rate (69% vs. 39%, p=0.003) and prolonged progression free survival rate (15.9 months vs. 10.1 months, p=0.0059) over single agent bendamustine treatment. The overall incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the two treatment cohorts. There was a higher incidence of adverse events of fever, neutropenia (which is a low white blood cell count that could predispose a patient to infection) and thrombocytopenia (which is a low platelet count that if severe could lead to bleeding) with the combination. The addition of otlertuzumab did not appear to increase the number of serious adverse events, as there were fewer discontinuations for adverse events with the combination compared to bendamustine alone. 
 We are conducting a Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of otlertuzumab in combination with rituximab, an anti-CD20-directed biologic that binds to CD20, a receptor found primarily on the surface of immune system B-cells. We amended our Phase 1b single-arm study to include evaluating otlertuzumab in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated CLL (Study 16009). Patients began enrolling in this arm of the study mid-2015. Preliminary data showed that the combination was active and generally tolerated. We continue to evaluate opportunities for otlertuzumab as a product candidate in the treatment of CLL.
 ROR1. We have developed a proof of concept bispecific immunotherapeutic protein that targets ROR1, an antigen found on several solid tumors and hematologic, or blood-related, malignancies and CD3. The proof of concept molecules were created using our ADAPTIR platform; each with one pair of binding domains, with one pair binding to ROR1 on tumors and the other pair of binding domains binding to the CD3, a component of the TCR complex. Its mechanism of action is RTCC against tumors expressing ROR1. Initial preclinical data demonstrate significant RTCC against tumors in preclinical models demonstrating that ROR1 can be targeted with an ADAPTIR bispecific. We are currently developing product candidates targeting ROR1 that will be designed for therapeutic uses.
 APVO436. We have developed APVO436, a preclinical ADAPTIR bispecific immunotherapeutic protein targeting CD123, a cell surface receptor highly expressed on several hematological malignancies and CD3, a component of the T-cell receptor. Similar to MOR209/ES414 and the ROR1 preclinical program, APVO436 utilizes redirected T-cell cytotoxicity (RTCC) to initiate killing of tumor cells. Preclinical data on this anti-CD123 ADAPTIR bispecific will be presented at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. These data demonstrate in vitro RTCC activity and in vivo tumor cell killing in animal models of disease, demonstrating that CD123 can be targeted with an ADAPTIR bispecific. 
 ADAPTIR Therapeutic Candidates. Multiple additional candidates that are focused on immuno-oncology and based on the ADAPTIR platform technology are in different stages of pre-clinical development.
 Potential adverse events related to our product candidates 
 Experimental drugs may have a variety of adverse events related to their target, mechanism of action or off target toxicities. Clinical trials are conducted to define the efficacy and safety of a new molecule and this data is reviewed by the FDA prior to FDA approval. The majority of the drugs that we are developing are intended for the treatment of cancer. Because cancer is a serious and life threatening disease, these patients experience a number of serious adverse events as part of their disease. The risk-benefit ratio for new treatments of cancer is different than other less serious diseases. For example, for the treatment of hypertension, it is not acceptable for a drug to lower the number of white blood cells that fight infections. However, chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer frequently lowers the number of white blood cells and infections do occur, which physicians manage in the course of a patient’s cancer treatment. In order to distinguish whether a new drug causes adverse events, a controlled trial is frequently conducted comparing a new drug to another therapy. 
 8


In clinical trials to date with otlertuzumab, a variety of adverse events have been reported. The events that have been reported with infusion of the drug include: infusion reactions, fever, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Severe infusion reactions were infrequent. When these reactions are severe they lead to hypotension (low blood pressure) and bronchospasm (difficulty breathing). Neutropenia is a low white blood cell count that could predispose a patient to infection. The neutropenia observed with otlertuzumab was mild to moderate, not prolonged and did not increase the infection rate in a controlled clinical trial. Thrombocytopenia is a low platelet count that if severe could lead to bleeding. The thrombocytopenia observed with otlertuzumab was infrequent and not associated with bleeding. Any of these events or others that have not yet been experienced, could lead to adverse events, including death and severely limit the drug’s use in the market or even its ability to be approved by a regulatory body. 
 MOR209/ES414 is currently being tested in its first clinical trial in humans. Fifteen patients have received the drug. One of the significant serious adverse events associated with the drug to date is infusion reactions. Infusion reactions are often associated with the infusion of a protein and are expected with this drug that activates T-cells. The other serious adverse events that have been reported with infusion of the drug include: fever, fatigue, hypertension, bronchospasm, chills and rigors. The severity of these reactions varied by patient and were managed medically and resolved. 
 As previously noted, in December 2015, after a joint review of data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study of MOR209/ES414 in prostate cancer patients, Aptevo and MorphoSys concluded that the dosing regimen and administration required adjustment. See section entitled “Collaborations and Licenses” for additional information about our collaboration with MorphoSys to develop MOR209/ES414.
 Research and Development 
 We are engaged in research and development of therapeutics including the product candidates listed above and other new candidates. We incur substantial expenses for these activities. These expenses generally include the cost of inventing new technologies and products, as well as development work on new product candidates. We pursue partnerships with various third parties and these partnerships and the sales of our approved products partially offset these expenditures. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $29.5 million and $37.4 million, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Research and Development Expense” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding expenditures related to material research and development activities. 
Distribution 
 Our products are sold in the United States by our commercial sales force and distributed to end-users through major U.S. distributors and wholesalers, including Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and other specialty distributors. In Canada, our products are sold to Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec, with Emergent acting as our exclusive Canadian distributor. Outside of North America, our commercial products are distributed primarily through third-party distributors.

The commercial operations team includes two U.S.-based field sales forces. The hemophilia sales team focuses its selling efforts primarily on hemophilia treatment centers and hematology clinics, while the immunology team concentrates on hematology/oncology and medical oncology clinics, transplant centers and public and private hospitals. Outside of the United States, our products are sold through a network of regional independent distributors. Orders are filled upon receipt, and we generally have no orders on backlog. The commercial operations team also includes a marketing team with experience in building pharmaceutical and biological brands across all stages of the product life cycle. Reimbursement support, patient assistance/compassionate use and non-medical customer inquiries are handled by customer service personnel within our commercial operations team. 
 Our medical affairs team includes field-based medical science liaisons, who respond to customer requests for information, establish and maintain company relationships with researchers and clinicians, train our product specialists and sales personnel and interface with clinical trial investigators. Our medical affairs team also supports customers by providing medical information, drug safety and pharmacovigilance services. 
 Competition 
 Our products and product candidates face significant competition. Any product or product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize is likely to compete with currently marketed products, as well as other novel product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition with respect to our products and product candidates includes the following: 

• | IXINITY. Currently, IXINITY competes with four recombinant factor IX products that are marketed in North America: Rixubis (Baxalta US Inc.), Benefix® (Pfizer Inc.) Idelvion® (CSL Behring) and Alprolix® (Biogen Idec Inc.) recombinant factor IX products. We expect that Novo Nordisk Inc. will also launch a factor IX agent in the future.

• | WinRho SDF. In the United States, the use of WinRho SDF is primarily for the ITP indication. In the United States ITP market, WinRho SDF competes with IVIG (several manufacturers), Rhophylac® (CSL Behring, a subsidiary of CSL Limited), Nplate® (Amgen Inc.) and Promacta® (GlaxoSmithKline plc). In Canada, the use of WinRho SDF is primarily for the HDN indication. There are several products in late phase clinical trials for ITP also expected to enter this category.

• | HepaGam B. HepaGam B is currently the only intravenous hepatitis B immune globulin licensed for the liver transplantation indication in the United States and Canada. HepaGam B competes with two products that are marketed in North America: Nabi-HB® (Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation) and HyperHEP B® S/D (Grifols USA, LLC). Nabi-HB® and HyperHEP B® S/D are both licensed to treat acute exposure to blood containing hepatitis B surface antigen (post-exposure prophylaxis) and administered via intramuscular injection. The use of anti-viral drugs is also a competitive threat to this product.

• | VARIZIG. No other currently manufactured competitive product is marketed in the North American markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MOR209/ES414. If approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we anticipate that MOR209/ES414 would compete with Taxotere® (Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC), Jevtana (Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC), Zytiga® (Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Xtandi® (Astellas Pharma, Inc.), Xofigo® (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc.), Provenge® (Dendreon Corporation) and potentially other products currently under development. There is a potential that MOR209/ES414 could also be used in combination with these same agents. According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States. Screening, radiation, surgery and hormone ablation therapy have greatly improved the detection and treatment of early stage prostate cancer. New therapies approved recently for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer only improve life expectancy by a few months, and a significant medical need still exists for these individuals.

• | ES210. If approved, we anticipate that ES210 would compete with products indicated for inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, including: HUMIRA® (AbbVie Inc.), Remicade® (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Johnson and Johnson) and Entyvio® (Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc., a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited). Depending on what ES210 is approved for, we anticipate that it could also compete with products indicated for moderate to severe Crohn’s Disease, including: Stelara (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Johnson and Johnson) and Xeljanz (Pfizer Inc.).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | otlertuzumab. If approved for CLL, we anticipate that otlertuzumab would compete with, or be combined with, other B-cell depleting therapies, targeted therapies and chemotherapeutics, including: Rituxan® (Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group), Treanda® (Cephalon, a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.), Arzerra® (GlaxoSmithKline plc and Genmab A/S), Imbruvica™ (Pharmacyclics, Inc. and Johnson and Johnson), Gayzva™ (Genentech USA, Inc., a member of the Roche Group), Zydelig® (Gilead Sciences, Inc.) and VenclextaTM (AbbVie). Nordic Nanovector has a product candidate targeting CD37 in Phase 1 development. In addition, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH and ImmunoGen, Inc. are in early stage development for monoclonal antibodies directed to CD37.

• | ROR1. If approved, we anticipate that the proof of concept bispecific immunotherapeutic protein targeting ROR1 we develop may compete with other ROR1 directed protein therapeutics, including those that block the growth of cancer cells by binding to specific proteins needed for tumor formation and growth and that are under current clinical and pre-clinical development. We also anticipate that any proof of concept bispecific immunotherapeutic protein targeting ROR1 may compete with ROR1-directed cellular therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cells (T-cells collected from a patient’s own blood and genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors that allow the T-cells to recognize specific tumor cells), also known as CAR-T, that are under current clinical development by MD Anderson Cancer Center as well as a separate program under pre-clinical development by Juno Therapeutics, Inc.

• | APVO436. If approved for AML, we anticipate that APVO436 would compete with other agents targeting CD123 that are in development if they are also approved. Bispecifics in development targeting CD123 include: MGD006 (Macrogenics), JNJ-63709178 (Janssen) and XmAb14045 (Xencor). There are at least two CAR-T therapies in development; CART123 (University of Penn.) and CARTCD123 (NCI/City of Hope). Other competitive products targeting CD123 are: SGN-CD123A (antibody drug conjugate, Seattle Genetics), SL-401 (antibody immunotoxin, Stemline), KHK2833 (monoclonal antibody, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma), and CSL362 (monoclonal antibody, CSL/Janssen).

COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSES 
 We have entered into several significant collaborations and transactions to support our growth. These include the following: 
 Collaboration with MorphoSys AG to develop MOR209/ES414 
 In August 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with MorphoSys to co-develop and commercialize our novel oncology immunotherapeutic, MOR209/ES414, developed for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Under the collaboration agreement, we retain commercialization rights in the United States and Canada, with a tiered royalty obligation to MorphoSys, ranging from mid-single digit up to 20% of sales. MorphoSys has worldwide commercialization rights excluding the United States and Canada, with a low single digit royalty obligation to us. The royalty term is determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and begins on the date at which a substantial amount of cumulative net sales has been reached and ends on the expiration of patents covering such licensed product in such country or twelve years after the initiation of royalty payments if there is no such valid claim.
 11


In December 2015, after a joint review of data from the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study of MOR209/ES414 in prostate cancer patients, we and MorphoSys concluded that the dosing regimen and administration required adjustment. The decision to adjust development of MOR209/ES414 was not based on safety aspects but was driven by the high complexity and properties of this first generation ADAPTIR bispecific molecule. Patients receiving weekly doses of MOR209/ES414 developed antibodies against the drug; this is called anti-drug antibodies, or ADA. ADA developed in most patients including those receiving the maximum tolerated dose of drug that could be given safely on a weekly basis. These antibodies bind to the drug, reduced the concentration of MOR209/ES414 in the blood and thus could potentially reduce its efficacy. We observed no safety issues related to the development of ADA. The cause of these antibodies is unclear but could be due to the weekly administration of the drug. The protocol has been amended to continuous intravenous infusion as a way to administer higher levels of drug and prevent the development of ADA. As a result of the dosing regimen change and the impact to the overall development timeline and technical risk, we amended our co-development agreement with MorphoSys in December 2015. Under the terms of the amended agreement, MorphoSys’ cost sharing in the years 2016 to 2018 was reduced and future milestone payments payable by MorphoSys to us were reduced to a total of up to $74.0 million. In addition, the amended collaboration agreement changed the total expected funding requirement for us to up to approximately $250 million. The MOR209/ES414 Phase I clinical trial under the amended protocol, providing continuous intravenous infusion as a way to administer higher levels of drug and prevent the development of ADA, commenced December 2016.
 In December 2016, the collaboration agreement was further amended to adjust the allocation of certain manufacturing and development costs and extend MorphoSys’s convenience termination rights. Under the amendment, we will bear 75% of all development costs with respect to MOR209/ES414, and MorphoSys will bear 25% of such costs, during the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017. During the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, we will bear 49% of such development costs and MorphoSys will bear 51%.Beyond January 1, 2019, we will bear 36% and MorphoSys will bear 64% of such development costs. In addition, the timeframe for a one-time right to terminate the collaboration agreement by MorphoSys has been extended from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017, or within one week following the receipt and discussion of clinical data from the first six patients enrolled and dosed in the MOR209/ES414 Phase I clinical trial. 
 Product License and Trademark License Agreements with Emergent 
 In July 2016 in connection with the separation, we entered into a product license agreement with Emergent pursuant to which Emergent granted us a perpetual, exclusive royalty-free, nontransferable worldwide license, under certain licensed intellectual property rights, to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import WinRho SDF, HepaGam B and VARIZIG in their respective indications to support our hyperimmune products. Under the product license agreement, in the event we cease to use Emergent as a manufacturer of our hyperimmune products, we are only permitted to exercise rights with respect to Emergent’s human hyperimmune platform manufacturing know-how through a third-party contract manufacturer which has either been approved by Emergent (in Emergent’s sole and absolute discretion) or if there has been a manufacturing failure under the Emergent manufacturing services agreement. We may terminate our rights under the agreement at any time by providing written notice to Emergent. Emergent may terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time or is incapable of cure. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party experiences certain bankruptcy events. 
 We entered into a trademark license agreement with Emergent pursuant to which Emergent granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable license under certain trademarks of Emergent to distribute the physical inventory of packaging and marketing materials assigned to us as part of the distribution, solely to sell, offer to sell and otherwise commercialize the commercial products until such inventory of packaging and marketing materials is depleted or, if earlier, the third anniversary of the distribution. We may terminate our rights under the agreement at any time by providing written notice to Emergent. Emergent may terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time or is uncurable. 
 12


License with the University of North Carolina to IXINITY intellectual property rights 
 In connection with our separation from Emergent, we assumed an exclusive license from the University of North Carolina, or UNC, to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import factor IX and factor VII(a) therapeutics, including IXINITY, under certain UNC’s patents. We are required to pay a low single digit royalty obligation to UNC under the license. The license agreement expires when the last of the licensed patents expire, on a country-by-country basis. The last of the licensed patents expires in or around September 2024. Patent term extension is being sought in the United States, and if granted, the last patent to expire in the United States will expire in or around November 2028. UNC may terminate the license if a material breach is not cured forty-five days after notice, we become bankrupt or insolvent, or we do not pay a yearly minimum earned royalty (in the mid-five digits). We can terminate the license with sixty days’ notice to UNC.
 MANUFACTURING AND SUPPORT SERVICES
 In connection with our separation, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement with Emergent. Emergent owns facilities with manufacturing and other capabilities located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where our hyperimmune specialty plasma products WinRho SDF, HepaGam B and VARIZIG are currently manufactured. Under the agreement, Emergent will continue to manufacture our hyperimmune specialty plasma products. Under this agreement, Emergent also provides third-party logistics services for our hyperimmune specialty plasma products and IXINITY. 
 The manufacturing services agreement with Emergent covers each step in the manufacturing process from raw materials procurement, bulk manufacturing, filling and finishing, testing, labeling, and packaging of final product, as well as third-party logistics services for delivery of such product to Aptevo customers on our behalf. We are reliant exclusively on Emergent for the provision of each of these services as it relates to WinRho SDF, HepaGam B and VARIZIG and as it relates to third-party logistics services for IXINITY. Emergent also serves as a distributor in Canada under the Canadian distributor agreement we entered into with Emergent. Pursuant to this arrangement, Emergent receives product intended for sale in Canada on our behalf and delivers it to our other Canadian distributors: Canadian Blood Services and Hema-Quebec. 
 In addition, Emergent is providing transition services to us and may provide such services for up to two years following the separation. These services cover such functions as regulatory, pharmacovigilance, clinical research and quality assurance under our supervision. Pharmacovigilance refers to the drug safety evaluation process during clinical trials or after market approval where the effects of therapeutics or medical drugs are monitored to identify and evaluate adverse reactions.
 As more fully explained below, we rely primarily on CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc., or CMC, for drug substance manufacture of IXINITY, on Patheon UK Limited for fill-finish services of IXINITY and on Rovi Contract Manufacturing, S.L. for supply of the syringe pre-filled with water for injection packaged with IXINITY. IXINITY will be delivered to Aptevo customers by Emergent as part of the third-party logistics services it provides to Aptevo under the manufacturing services agreement. For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Commercial packaging, packaging component procurement and release, ancillary procurement and distribution for IXINITY will be provided by Emergent and various other parties. 
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 We rely on Emergent for all supplies and raw materials used in the production of WinRho SDF, HepaGam B and VARIZIG. 
 13


Agreement with CMC Biologics. We rely on CMC, for the manufacture of the substance that becomes the active ingredient (the bulk drug substance) in the production of our IXINITY product. We have an exclusive Commercial Supply (Manufacturing Services) Agreement with CMC pursuant to which, subject to specified exceptions, we are obligated to purchase at least eight batches and CMC is obligated to maintain a maximum capacity for sixteen batches of IXINITY bulk drug substance per full year. The agreement has a six-year term expiring on June 17, 2017. CMC is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform services in accordance with our forecast and projected delivery dates. In the event there is a supply failure as defined under the agreement, the agreement becomes non-exclusive with respect to 50% of our forecasted demand (or up to the unsupplied quantities until supply reinstatement). 
 The agreement provides for milestone payments in addition to fees for services. The milestone payments set forth in the agreement have been paid. To the extent an invoice dispute is not resolved within sixty days of our original notice, if we have withheld payment, CMC is entitled to suspend the services until such time dispute is resolved in accordance with terms of the agreement. In addition to other limitations on damages (e.g. specific to replacement of defective product), with several exceptions, neither party is liable under the agreement for loss or damage in respect of indirect, special or consequential damages or losses. With several exceptions, CMC’s aggregate liability to us for any loss or damage suffered by us under the agreement in respect of services in a calendar year is limited to an amount equal to 1.1 times the total price of the services performed under the agreement subject to a maximum of $30.0 million. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party fails to pay any amount properly due and payable with ten days of notice demanding payment after the expiration of the original payment term or if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to remedy any such breach capable of remedy during a twenty business day notice period. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party experiences certain bankruptcy events. This agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party; however, termination shall not affect the accrued rights of either party. We may also terminate our obligations under the agreement with a specified amount of prior notice, if CMC has any material permit or regulatory license permanently revoked preventing the performance of services by CMC, if CMC is subject to certain competitor change of control events, or where there is a supply failure prior to a supply reinstatement where CMC does not reinstate supply within twelve months of the supply failure. 
 Agreement with Patheon UK Limited. Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon, through an affiliate, is currently the sole source third-party manufacturer that performs the services of filling the bulk drug substance into vials for our IXINITY product. We have a non-exclusive Manufacturing Services Agreement with Patheon pursuant to which Aptevo is obligated to order, and Patheon agrees to perform, a specified amount of such services on an annual basis. Under the agreement, Patheon also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform services in excess of such minimum purchase commitments subject to its available capacity. The agreement has an initial three-year term expiring on May 26, 2018, and thereafter renews for successive terms of two years each, unless either party gives the other party at least eighteen months’ notice. We may terminate the agreement on a specified amount of notice if a regulatory authority prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the product or if we no longer order services for a product due to the product’s discontinuance in the market; however, we must still perform any surviving obligations as specified in the agreement. Patheon may terminate the agreement upon six months’ notice if we assign our rights under the agreement to an assignee that, in Patheon’s opinion acting reasonably, is not a credit-worthy substitute, a Patheon competitor, or an entity with whom Patheon has had prior unsatisfactory business relations. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time, if the other party experiences certain bankruptcy events, or upon a period of notice if the parties do not agree upon certain pricing adjustments. Except in respect of liability for certain third party claims, breach of confidentiality obligations, or replacement of defective product, Patheon’s liability is limited under the agreement to 10% of the revenues for such year to Patheon under the agreement. Patheon’s liability in respect of replacement of defective product is limited to the amount paid by us to Patheon for such product. Except in respect of a breach of confidentiality obligations, neither party is liable to the other under the agreement for any loss of profits or other damages of an indirect or consequential nature. 
 14


Agreement with Rovi Contract Manufacturing, S.L. Rovi Contract Manufacturing, S.L., or Rovi, is currently the sole source third-party manufacturer that supplies the syringe pre-filled with water for injection, that is packaged with and required for reconstitution of our IXINITY product. We have a non-exclusive supply agreement with Rovi pursuant to which Rovi is obligated to use its best efforts to supply the quantity of syringes ordered by us. The agreement has a five-year term expiring on April 28, 2019, and thereafter renews for successive five-year terms, unless Rovi provides us with written notice of its intent not to renew at least twenty-four months prior to the expiration of the term or any renewal term. We may terminate the agreement for any reason on at least twelve months’ prior notice. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time. Neither party is liable under the agreement for loss or damage in respect of indirect, special or consequential damages or losses except to the extent such damages are caused by willful misconduct. Each party’s liability under the agreement, annually and in the aggregate, is limited to three times the amount invoiced by Rovi under the agreement for products during the 12-month period preceding the incident with a maximum limit of six million Euros; provided that in respect of certain third-party claims or costs resulting or arising from defective or infringing products or claims for injunctive relief, each party’s liability under the agreement, annually and in the aggregate, is limited to six million Euros. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We actively seek intellectual property protection for our products and product candidates. We own or exclusively license patent rights supporting IXINITY, the ADAPTIR platform and pipeline products including MOR209/ES414, ES210, and otlertuzumab. We practice patent life cycle management by filing patent applications to protect new inventions relating to meaningful improvements to our products and related methods. We primarily seek patent protection for inventions that support our products and product candidates, but from time to time we seek patent protection for inventions that could, for instance, support a potential business opportunity or block a competitor from designing around our existing patents.
 In general, and where possible, we pursue patent protection in countries where we believe there will be a significant market for the corresponding product or product candidate. We generally do not seek patent protection in countries where we have reason to believe we would not be able to enforce patents. For instance, we tend to not file in countries that are frequently listed on the Priority Watch List of the Special 301 Report prepared by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, with the exception that we occasionally file patent applications in China, Russia and India. We may also decide to take a narrower filing approach for secondary and improvement type inventions as compared to inventions that are more foundational to our products. We do not seek patent protection in countries which are on the United Nations, or U.N., list of Least Developed Countries. 
 The term of protection for various patents associated with and expected to be associated with our marketed products and product candidates is typically twenty years from the filing date but may vary depending on a variety of factors including the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the necessity for terminal disclaimers, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. 
 In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. When determining whether to protect intellectual property as a trade secret, we consider many factors including, for instance, our ability to maintain the trade secret, the likelihood that a competitor will independently develop the information, our ability to patent protect the intellectual property and the likelihood we would be able to enforce a resulting patent. 
 We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. These agreements impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. 
 15


ADAPTIR Platform. We protect the ADAPTIR platform technology through a combination of patents and trade secrets. We own all ADAPTIR platform intellectual property, except that we have a non-exclusive research license with Lonza to certain CHO cell lines, which are cells derived from the ovary of a Chinese hamster and often used in biological and medical research and commercially in the production of therapeutic proteins, for use in protein expression and the GS System. The GS System is a cell transfection and protein expression system that uses a robust viral promoter and selection via glutamine metabolism to provide rapid development of high-yielding and stable mammalian cell lines that express transfected proteins of therapeutic interest. The GS System is well known in the industry, and according to Lonza, is a familiar system that has been used by over 100 global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Under our Lonza research license, we have an option to take a license to use the GS System to develop and manufacture therapeutic proteins for our commercial purposes. 
 The intellectual property we own that supports our ADAPTIR platform was generated internally at Emergent or at Trubion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Trubion, prior to its acquisition by Emergent in 2010, or at Aptevo following the separation. One patent family which supports use of unique linkers in the homodimer (a molecule consisting of two identical halves) version of the platform was invented jointly by Trubion and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Wyeth, as part of a collaboration between the two companies. Upon termination of a product license agreement between Wyeth and Trubion, Wyeth assigned the rights it had in that platform patent family to Trubion. These rights have since transferred to us. 
 In order to differentiate our platform inventions from antibodies and other antibody-like constructs that have been publicly disclosed, many of our patents and patent applications are directed to unique aspects or components of our platform such as linkers or binding domains. Our ADAPTIR platform can be homodimeric or heterodimeric. Although most of our patent families protect both homodimeric and heterodimeric forms of the platform, we also have a patent family that is focused on the heterodimeric form of the platform. 
 We have filed patent applications for the ADAPTIR platform in the United States and in countries and territories, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. We plan to continue to improve our ADAPTIR platform and to file patent applications on those improvements. Our decision as to where to file any new ADAPTIR improvement inventions will be based in part on the significance of the improvement. If patents issue on the pending ADAPTIR patent applications, the patent term for those patents are estimated to expire between June 2027 and September 2036. 
 Hyperimmune products, WinRho, HepaGam B and VARIZIG. We rely on the confidential nature of our in-licensed manufacturing know-how as well as trade secret protection to protect our licensed products to the extent we are able to do so. In connection with our separation from Emergent, we received a license from Emergent under certain of its proprietary human hyperimmune platform manufacturing know-how that we may exercise under specified circumstances. Our WinRho SDF, HepaGam B and VARIZIG products are protected by Emergent’s manufacturing trade secrets. We rely on this intellectual property to protect our WinRho SDF, HepaGam B and VARIZIG products. We do not have patent protection for WinRho SDF, HepaGam B or VARIZIG. 
 IXINITY (coagulation factor IX (recombinant)). We license patents and patent applications from UNC, which support the manufacture of factor IX and other Vitamin K Dependent Proteins. In addition to the patent assets licensed from UNC, we own a patent portfolio with claims generally directed to factor IX pharmaceutical compositions, methods of making recombinant factor IX protein, and cell lines producing recombinant factor IX protein. This patent portfolio includes issued patents in Australia, Europe and Japan and pending patent applications in other territories including the United States. If patents issue on our pending patent applications, the patent term for those patents is estimated to expire between December 2026 and October 2030. The estimated patent expirations are subject to change based on patent term adjustments, extensions or terminal disclaimers. 
 MOR209/ES414. We have patents and pending patent applications supporting the MOR209/ES414 product candidate. We have foundational patents and patent applications in countries including the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. The foundational patents which grant in this patent family are estimated to expire in April 2032. The estimated patent expirations are subject to change based on patent term adjustments, extensions or terminal disclaimers. 
 16


ES210. We have patents and pending patent applications supporting our ES210 product candidate. We have foundational patents and patent applications in countries and territories, including the United States., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. The foundational patents which grant in this patent family are estimated to expire in October 2029. The estimated patent expirations are subject to change based on patent term adjustments, extensions or terminal disclaimers. 
 otlertuzumab. We have patents and pending patent applications supporting the otlertuzumab product candidate. We have foundational patents and patent applications in countries and territories, including the United States, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa and South Korea. The foundational patents and patent applications which grant in these patent families are estimated to expire between July 2026 and April 2029. The estimated patent expirations are subject to change based on patent term adjustments, extensions or terminal disclaimers. 
 Corporate Trademarks. Where possible, we pursue registered trademarks for our marketed products in significant markets. In addition, we have pending trademark applications covering APTEVO, a graphic logo, APTEVO THERAPEUTICS, APTEVO BIOTHERAPEUTICS, APTEVO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT and ADAPTIR. 
REGULATION
 Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
 Product Development for Therapeutics
 Pre-clinical Testing. Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the United States, stringent government requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. We perform pre-clinical testing on all of our product candidates before we initiate any human trials.
 Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND. The sponsor must also include an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation, together with information regarding the qualifications of the clinical investigators. The pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients with the target disease or disorder under the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

• | Phase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve a small sample of individuals with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | Phase 3 clinical trials consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA approval of the product candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials, if conducted, are conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, including to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific population. As part of a product approval, the FDA may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are called post-marketing commitment studies, be conducted post-approval.

 Good Clinical Practice. All of the phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected. Additionally, an Institutional Review Board at each site participating in a trial must obtain ongoing approval for conduct of the trial at that site.
 Marketing Approval—Biologics
 Biologics License Application. All data obtained from a comprehensive development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. The FDA has two months to review an application for its acceptability for filing. Once an application is accepted for filing, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, establishes a two-tiered review system: Standard Review and Priority Review. When conducting Priority Review, the FDA has a goal to review and act on BLA submissions within six months from the date of the FDA’s acceptance for filing of the application, rather than the ten-month goal under a Standard Review. The FDA gives Priority Review status to product candidates that provide safe and effective therapies where no satisfactory alternative exists or to a product candidate that constitutes a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, BLAs and certain supplements must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 In reviewing a BLA, the FDA may grant approval or deny the application through a complete response letter if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval requesting additional information. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which approval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug. The FDA may also significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a drug.

Fast Track Designation. The FDA may designate a product as a fast track drug if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this disease or condition. Sponsors granted a fast track designation for a drug are granted more opportunities to interact with the FDA during the approval process and are eligible for FDA review of the application on a rolling basis, before the application has been completed.
 Breakthrough Therapy. Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA may designate a product as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug” in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, waived filing fees for marketing applications and a seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. Our product candidate otlertuzumab was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of CLL by the FDA in November 2011 and received orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission in December 2012 for the treatment of CLL. Orphan designation in Europe qualifies a drug for certain development and commercial incentives, including protocol assistance, access to centralized authorization procedures, reduced fees for regulatory activities, and ten years of market exclusivity after approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements. Any biologic for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if warranted. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-label promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our products. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and promotion exist for products that have boxed warnings in their approved package inserts, such as WinRho SDF.

Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States and internationally, sales of our products and our ability to generate revenues on such sales are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payors, including state and federal governments and private insurance plans. Insurers have implemented cost-cutting measures and other initiatives to enforce more stringent reimbursement standards and likely will continue to do so in the future. These measures include the establishment of more restrictive formularies and increases in the out-of-pocket obligations of patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. Various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, increased the levels of rebates and discounts that we have to provide in connection with sales of such products that are paid for, or reimbursed by, certain state and federal government agencies and programs. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted, which could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for our products and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates we are required to pay to state and federal government entities. The most significant governmental reimbursement programs in the United States relevant to our products are described below:
 Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B covers certain drug products provided in a physician’s office or hospital outpatient setting under a payment methodology using “average sales price,” or ASP, information. We are required to provide ASP information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, on a quarterly basis. Medicare payment rates using an ASP methodology are currently set at ASP plus six percent, although this rate could change in future years. If we fail to timely or accurately submit ASP, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions. WinRho SDF, HepaGam B, VARIZIG and IXINITY are all eligible to be reimbursed under Medicare Part B.
 Medicaid Rebate Program. For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. The pricing information submitted, including information about the “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, and “best price” for each of our covered drugs, determines the amount of the rebate we must pay. The total rebate also includes an “additional” rebate, which functions as an “inflation penalty.” The Affordable Care Act increased the amount of the basic rebate and, for some “line extensions,” increased the additional rebate. It also requires manufacturers to pay rebates on utilization by enrollees in managed care organizations. If we fail to timely or accurately submit required pricing information, we could be subject to civil, monetary and other penalties. In addition, the Affordable Care Act changed the definition of AMP to address which manufacturer sales are to be considered, which affected the rebate liability for our products. Sales of WinRho SDF, HepaGam B, VARIZIG and IXINITY that are reimbursed through Medicaid are subject to the obligations related to this program.
 340B/PHS Drug Pricing Program. The availability of federal funds to pay for WinRho SDF, HepaGam B, VARIZIG and IXINITY under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs requires that we extend discounts under the 340B/Public Health Service, or PHS, drug pricing program. The 340B/PHS drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to charge no more than a statutorily-defined “ceiling” price to a variety of community health clinics and other covered entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as the outpatient departments of hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. A product’s ceiling price for a quarter reflects its Medicaid AMP from two quarters earlier less its Medicaid rebate amount from two quarters earlier. Therefore, the above-mentioned revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition enacted by the Affordable Care Act could cause the discount produced by the ceiling price to increase. Under the Affordable Care Act, several additional classes of entities were made eligible for these discounts, increasing the volume of sales for which we must now offer the 340B/PHS discounts.
 20


Federal Supply Schedule. We make WinRho SDF, HepaGam B, VARIZIG and IXINITY available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or DVA, pursuant to our FSS contract with the DVA. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, we are required to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing to four federal agencies—the DVA, the Department of Defense, or DoD, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service)—for federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of our products under the Medicaid program, Medicare Part B and for our products to be eligible to be purchased by those four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the “Federal Ceiling Price,” which is, at a minimum, 24% less than the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price for the prior fiscal year.
 Foreign Regulation
 Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States and Canada. In the future, we may further expand our commercial presence to additional foreign countries and territories. In the European Union, or EU, medicinal products are authorized following a process similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the EU Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). We will be subject to varying preapproval, approval and post-approval regulatory requirements similar to those imposed by the FDA in each foreign country in which we conduct regulated activities. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws
 We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including state and federal anti-kickback laws false claims laws, and patent privacy and security laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, or in return for, the referral of business that may be reimbursed by a third party payor (including Medicare and Medicaid), including the purchase, prescribing or recommendation of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Civil and criminal false claims laws, false statement laws and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, create federal criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 If we violate the healthcare fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to sanctions, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Similar restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in other countries. Laws (including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct are often strictly enforced. Even in those countries where we are not directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our products, inappropriate activity by our international distribution partners can have implications for us. 
 21


In addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to annually report to CMS payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interest held by physicians and their family members. This information is posted on a public website. Failure to timely and accurately submit required information could subject us to civil penalties. Some local, state and foreign governments have similar laws. Many of these transparency requirements are new and uncertain and the extent to which the laws will be enforced is not always clear.
 Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from directly or indirectly paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official or employee, or any foreign political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence such official, employee, party or candidate in his or her or its official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by activities taken on our behalf by our partners, collaborative partners, consultants, distributors, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents and representatives. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which applies to activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries where we do business.
 Health Care Reform
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was enacted which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. However, in January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. Although the Budget Resolution is not a law, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The first legislative proposal to repeal and replace the ACA was released in March 2017 by the House of Representatives titled, the “America Health Care Act”, or AHCA. The AHCA would, among other changes, eliminate individual and employer mandates, freeze enrollment in Medicaid expansion, eliminate certain taxes such as the “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans, and create refundable tax credits to assist individuals in buying health insurance. 
 22


Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 Additionally, on December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law, which is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. Among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
 We anticipate additional legislative changes in the future, including legislation to repeal and replace certain provisions of the ACA. It remains to be seen, however, precisely what the new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and/or containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 Other Regulation
 Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.
