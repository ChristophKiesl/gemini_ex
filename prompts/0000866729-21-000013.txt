CHILDREN’S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION 
(51.1% of fiscal 2021 revenues)

General
The Company’s Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution segment includes the publication and distribution of children’s books, ebooks, media and interactive products in the United States through its school book clubs and school book fairs channels and through its trade channel.
The Company is the world’s largest publisher and distributor of children’s books and is the leading operator of school-based book clubs and school-based book fairs in the United States. The Company is also a leading publisher of children’s print books, ebooks and audiobooks distributed through the trade channel. Scholastic offers a broad range of children’s books through its school and trade channels, many of which have received awards for excellence in children’s literature, including the Caldecott and Newbery Medals.
The Company obtains titles for sale through its distribution channels from three principal sources. The first source for titles is the Company’s publication of books created under exclusive agreements with authors, illustrators, book 
packagers or other media companies. Scholastic generally controls the exclusive rights to sell these titles through all channels of distribution in the United States and, to a lesser extent, internationally. Scholastic’s second source of titles is through obtaining licenses to publish books exclusively in specified channels of distribution, including reprints of books originally published by other publishers for which the Company acquires rights to sell in the school market. The third source of titles is the Company’s purchase of finished books from other publishers. 
School-Based Book Clubs

Scholastic founded its first school-based book club in 1948. The Company's school-based book clubs consist of reading clubs for pre-K through grade 8. In addition to its regular reading club offerings, the Company creates special theme-based and seasonal offers targeted to different grade levels during the year. 
The Company distributes promotional materials containing order forms to classrooms in the vast majority of the pre-K to grade 8 schools in the United States. Classroom teachers who wish to participate in a school-based book club provide the promotional materials to their students, who may choose from curated selections at substantial reductions from list prices. The teacher aggregates the students’ orders and forwards them to the Company. Approximately 58% of kindergarten ("K") to grade 5 elementary school teachers in the United States who received promotional materials in fiscal 2021 participated in the Company’s school-based book clubs. In fiscal 2021, approximately 96% of total book club revenues were placed via the internet through the Company’s online ordering platform, which allows parents, as well as teachers, to order online, with approximately 56% of such revenues being placed by parents via the Company's online ordering platform. Products are typically shipped to the classroom for distribution to the students, however during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company provided shipping directly to parents' and teachers' homes due to school closures. Teachers who participate in book clubs receive bonus points and other promotional incentives, which may be redeemed from the Company for additional books and other resource materials and items for their classrooms or the school.
School-Based Book Fairs 

The Company entered the school-based book fairs channel in 1981 under the name Scholastic Book Fairs. The Company is the leading distributor of school-based book fairs in the United States serving schools in all 50 states. Book fairs provide children access to hundreds of popular, quality books and educational materials, increase student reading and help book fair organizers raise funds for the purchase of school library and classroom books, supplies and equipment. Book fairs have traditionally been weeklong events where children and families peruse and purchase their favorite books together. The Company typically delivers book fairs product from its warehouses to schools principally by a fleet of Company-owned and leased vehicles. However, as a result of COVID-19 school closings and the cancellation of physical book fairs held at schools, the Company offered virtual book fairs and ship-to-home options as an alternative temporary method for delivering fair products. Sales and customer service representatives, working from the Company’s regional offices, distribution facilities and national distribution facility in Missouri, along with local area field representatives, provide support to book fair organizers. Physical book fairs are conducted by school personnel, volunteers and parent-teacher organizations, from which the schools may receive either books, supplies and equipment or a portion of the proceeds from every book fair.
Trade

Scholastic is a leading publisher of children’s books sold through bookstores, on-line retailers and mass merchandisers primarily in the United States. Scholastic’s original publications include Harry Potter™, The Hunger Games®, The Bad Guys™, The Baby-Sitters Club® graphic novels, The Magic School Bus®, Captain Underpants®, Dog Man®, Wings of Fire™, Cat Kid Comic Club™, Goosebumps® and Clifford The Big Red Dog®, and licensed properties such as Peppa Pig® and Pokemon®.

The Company’s trade organization focuses on publishing, marketing and selling books to bookstores, on-line retailers, mass merchandisers, specialty sales outlets and other book retailers, and also supplies books for the Company’s proprietary school channels. The Company maintains a talented and experienced creative staff that constantly seeks to attract, develop and retain the best children’s authors and illustrators. The Company believes that its trade publishing staff, combined with the Company’s reputation and proprietary school distribution channels, provides a significant competitive advantage, evidenced by numerous bestsellers over the past two decades. Bestsellers in the trade division during fiscal 2021 included Dav Pilkey's Dog Man series and Cat Kid Comic Club, The Ickabog®, All Because You Matter, Harry Potter series, including Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone: MinaLima Edition, The Ballad 
of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel), Wings of Fire, Book 14: The Dangerous Gift and The Baby-Sitters Club graphic novels, including Logan Likes Mary Anne! and Claudia and the New Girl. 
Also included in the Company's trade organization are Weston Woods Studios, Inc. ("Weston Woods") and Scholastic Audio, as well as Scholastic Entertainment Inc. ("SEI"). Weston Woods creates audiovisual adaptations of classic children's picture books distributed through the school and retail markets. Scholastic Audio provides audiobook productions of popular children's titles. SEI is responsible for exploiting the Company's film and television assets, which include a large television programming library based on the Company's properties, and for developing new programming. 
Scholastic is also a leading publisher of quality children’s reference and non-fiction products sold primarily to schools and libraries in the United States. These products include non-fiction books published in the United States under the imprints Children’s Press® and Franklin Watts®. 
EDUCATION 
(24.0% of fiscal 2021 revenues)

The Education segment includes the publication and distribution to schools and libraries of children’s books, other print and on-line reference, non-fiction and fiction focused products, classroom magazines and classroom materials for core and supplemental literacy instruction, as well as consulting services and related products supporting professional development for teachers and school and district administrators, including professional books, coaching, workshops and seminars which in combination cover grades pre-K to 12 in the United States. In response to COVID-19 school closings, the Company has introduced alternative distribution methods including "take home packs" that are provided to schools and school districts, allowing families access to educational materials when arriving at local facilities to access meals as part of the National School Lunch Program and, in certain circumstances, were mailed to individual residences. In addition, the Company offers a "learning at home" service providing free learning activities and resources to students and their families.
Scholastic Literacy
In the spring of 2019, the Company launched Scholastic Literacy, a comprehensive approach to core literacy for students in kindergarten to grade 6 that includes curriculum materials in both digital and print. Scholastic Literacy's instructional methodology leads to responsive teaching in three classroom configurations: (1) to students with teacher-led whole class instruction; (2) with children through teacher-facilitated small group differentiated instruction; and (3) by students through independent reading practice and mastery. The Company believes that the Scholastic Literacy core curriculum reading program contains a number of key differentiators, including the highest volume of authentic and culturally-relevant texts in the market and data to inform responsive, personalized instruction for students, which will help it continue to gain traction in the market.
Supplemental
The Company is a leading provider of classroom libraries and paperback collections, including best-selling titles and leveled books for guided reading, to individual teachers and other educators and schools and school district customers. Additionally, the Company provides books to community-based organizations and other groups engaged in literacy initiatives through Scholastic Family and Community Engagement (FACE). Professional consulting services are also provided to support academic leadership with training on a multitude of topics, ranging from product implementation to engaging with families and communities. Scholastic helps schools build classroom collections of high quality, award-winning books for every grade, reading level and multicultural background. Scholastic serves customer needs with customized support for literacy instruction, by providing comprehensive literacy programs which include print and digital content, as well as providing assessment tools. These materials are designed to support instruction based teaching and learning, and are generally purchased by district and school leadership, both directly from the Company and through teacher stores and booksellers, including the Company's on-line teacher store (www.scholastic.com/teacherstore), which provides professional books and other educational materials to teachers and other educators. 
Scholastic is also the leading publisher of classroom magazines. Teachers in grades pre-K to 12 use the Company’s 33 classroom magazines, including Scholastic News®, Scholastic Scope®, Storyworks®, Let's Find Out® and Junior Scholastic®, to supplement formal learning programs by bringing subjects of current interest into the classroom, including current events, literature, math, science, social studies and foreign languages. These offerings provide schools with substantial non-fiction material, which is required to meet new higher educational standards. Each magazine has its own website with online digital resources that supplement the print materials, as well as providing access to the magazine in a digital format. A "digital only" subscription to the magazine is also offered, in which digital 
delivery is expected to be increasingly important due to COVID-19 uncertainties. Scholastic’s classroom magazine circulation in the United States in fiscal 2021 was approximately 12.4 million, with approximately 80% of the circulation in grades pre-K to 6. The majority of magazines purchased are paid for with school or district funds, with parents and teachers paying for the balance. Also included in the segment is the Company's custom publishing business, which was phased out, or in some cases, assigned to other business units for particular clients. 
INTERNATIONAL 
(24.9% of fiscal 2021 revenues)
General

The International segment includes the publication and distribution of products and services outside the United States by the Company’s international operations, and its export and foreign rights businesses.

Scholastic has operations in Major Markets, which include Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as in India, Singapore and other parts of Asia including Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.

Many of the Company’s international operations also have their own export and foreign rights licensing programs and are book publishing licensees for major media properties. Original books published by many of these operations have received awards for excellence in children’s literature. In Asia, the Company also publishes and distributes products under the Grolier name for parents to provide English language learning for their children at home and engages in direct sales in shopping malls and door to door, as well as operating a franchise program for tutorial centers that provide English language training to students primarily in China. 
Canada

Scholastic Canada, founded in 1957, is a leading publisher and distributor of English and French language children’s books in Canada. Scholastic Canada is the largest operator of school-based marketing channels in Canada and is one of the leading suppliers of original or licensed children’s books to the Canadian trade market. Since 1965, Scholastic Canada has also produced quality Canadian-authored books and educational materials, including an early reading program sold to schools for grades K to 6. In response to the COVID-19 school closures, the Canadian school-based businesses identified alternative methods to deliver products to students, which included shipping products directly to parents' homes. 
United Kingdom

Scholastic UK, founded in 1964, is the largest operator of school-based marketing channels in the United Kingdom and is a publisher and one of the leading suppliers of original or licensed children’s books to the United Kingdom trade market.

Asia 
The Company’s Asian operations include initiatives for educational publishing programs based out of Singapore, as well as the wholly-owned Grolier direct sales business, which has traditionally sold English language and early childhood learning materials through a network of independent sales representatives in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand and engages in direct sales in shopping malls and door to door, business activities which were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus. In addition, the Company operates school-based marketing channels throughout Asia; publishes original titles in English and Hindi languages in India, including specialized curriculum books for local schools; conducts reading improvement programs inside local schools in the Philippines; and operates a franchise program for English language tutorial centers in China in cooperation with local partners, which have been temporarily closed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. 
Foreign Rights and Export

The Company licenses the rights to select Scholastic titles in 65 languages to other publishing companies around the world. The Company’s export business sells educational materials, digital educational resources and children’s books to schools, libraries, bookstores and other book distributors in approximately 130 international locations that are not otherwise directly serviced by Scholastic subsidiaries. The Company also partners with governments and non-governmental agencies to create and distribute books to public schools in developing countries.
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

The Company’s books, magazines and other materials are manufactured by the Company with the assistance of third parties under contracts entered into through arms-length negotiations and competitive bidding. As appropriate, the Company enters into multi-year agreements that guarantee specified volumes in exchange for favorable pricing terms. Paper is purchased directly from paper mills and other third-party sources. 

In the United States, the Company mainly processes and fulfills orders for school-based book clubs, trade, reference and non-fiction products, educational products and export orders from its primary warehouse and distribution facility in Jefferson City, Missouri. In connection with its trade business, the Company may fulfill product orders directly from printers to customers. Magazine orders are processed at the Jefferson City facility and the magazines are shipped directly from printers. School-based book fairs are fulfilled through a network of warehouses across the country, as well as from the Company's Jefferson City warehouse and distribution facility. In fiscal 2021, the Company committed to permanently close 13 of the 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. The Company’s international school-based book clubs, school-based book fairs, trade and educational operations use distribution systems similar to those employed in the United States. 
The Company continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing and paper requirements as well as fulfillment needs. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion on potential risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

CONTENT ACQUISITION

Access to intellectual property or content (“Content”) for the Company’s product offerings is critical to the success of the Company’s operations. The Company incurs significant costs for the acquisition and development of Content for its product offerings. These costs are often deferred and recognized as the Company generates revenues derived from the benefits of these costs. These costs include the following:

•Prepublication costs - Prepublication costs are incurred in all of the Company’s reportable segments. Prepublication costs include costs incurred to create the art, prepress, editorial, digital conversion and other content required for the creation of the master copy of a book or other media. 
•Royalty advances - Royalty advances are incurred in all of the Company’s reportable segments, but are most prevalent in the Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution segment and enable the Company to obtain contractual commitments from authors to produce Content. The Company regularly provides authors with advances against expected future royalty payments, often before the books are written. Upon publication and sale of the books or other media, the authors generally will not receive further royalty payments until the contractual royalties earned from sales of such books or other media exceed such advances. The Company values its position in the market as the largest 
publisher and distributor of children's books in obtaining Content, and the Company’s experienced editorial staff aggressively acquires Content from both new and established authors.
•Acquired intangible assets - The Company may acquire fully or partially developed Content from third parties via acquisitions of entities or the purchase of the rights to Content outright.
SEASONALITY

The Company’s Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution school-based book club and book fair channels and most of its Education businesses operate on a school-year basis; therefore, the Company’s business is highly seasonal. As a result, the Company’s revenues in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year generally are lower than its revenues in the other two fiscal quarters. Typically, school-based channels and magazine revenues are minimal in the first quarter of the fiscal year as schools are not in session. Trade sales can vary throughout the year due to varying release dates of published titles. The Company generally experiences a loss from operations in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Company during fiscal 2021 and there remain many uncertainties concerning the timing of and any patterns which may emerge with respect to school instruction, whether in-school, remote or hybrid for the new school year, and the nature and continuing magnitude of the negative impact of COVID-19 into and beyond the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Reference is also made to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion on potential risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
COMPETITION
The markets for children’s books, educational products and entertainment materials are highly competitive. Competition is based on the quality and range of materials made available, price, promotion and customer service, as well as the nature of the distribution channels. Competitors include numerous other book, ebook, textbook, library, reference material and supplementary publishers, distributors and other resellers (including over the internet) of children’s books and other educational materials, national publishers of classroom and professional magazines with substantial circulation, and distributors of products and services on the internet. In the United States, competitors include regional and local school-based book fair operators and other fund raising activities in schools and bookstores, as well as one other competitor operating on a national level. Competition may increase to the extent that other entities enter the market and to the extent that current competitors or new competitors develop and introduce new materials that compete directly with the products distributed by the Company or develop or expand competitive sales channels. The Company believes that its position as both a publisher and distributor are unique to certain of the markets in which it competes, principally in the context of its children’s book business.
COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARKS

As an international publisher and distributor of books, Scholastic aggressively utilizes the intellectual property protections of the United States and other countries in order to maintain its exclusive rights to identify and distribute many of its products. Accordingly, SCHOLASTIC is a trademark registered in the United States and in a number of countries where the Company conducts business or otherwise distributes its products. The Corporation’s principal operating subsidiary in the United States, Scholastic Inc., and the Corporation’s international subsidiaries, through Scholastic Inc., have registered and/or have pending applications to register in relevant territories trademarks for important services and programs. All of the Company’s publications, including books and magazines, are subject to copyright protection both in the United States and internationally. The Company also obtains domain name protection for its internet domains. The Company seeks to obtain the broadest possible intellectual property rights for its products, and because inadequate legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect operating results, the Company vigorously defends those rights against infringement.
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,800 employees, of which 4,700 were located in the United States and 2,100 outside the United States. Globally, approximately 72% of our employees are employed on a full-time basis, 9% part-time, and 19% seasonal. The seasonal employees are largely associated with the school-based businesses which are dependent on the fall and spring seasons when schools are in session.
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (“HRCC") provides oversight on human capital matters. The HRCC is responsible for evaluating executive compensation, senior management selection, retention and succession planning and human resources strategies in respect to general employee benefit programs (including retirement plan programs) and talent management. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
We are committed to diverse representation, in the books we publish and those we distribute through our book fairs and book clubs, the articles we feature in our classroom magazines and the instructional tools we provide to educators. We offer books featuring a diverse representation of ethnicities and cultures, LGBTQIA+ protagonists, individuals with physical, mental, and emotional exceptionalities, other historically underrepresented groups, and increasing diversity of contributors. 
We have recently formed the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Task Force to advance our goals in three priority focus areas: People and Culture which will focus on creating an inclusive workplace culture, enabling ongoing internal education, and increasing overall staff diversity; Publishing and Education which will focus on promoting equity, social justice, representation and civic understanding in the classroom and in the world; and Procurement and Purchasing which will continue to expand supplier diversity, focused on sourcing from minority-owned businesses.
We will continue to build on Scholastic’s credo and our commitment to the individual worth of each and every child, regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, economic, political, attitudinal, neurodiversity, religious or demographic background and to inspire everyone who works at the Company with contemporary employee policies and programs dedicated to creating a safe, inclusive environment in which every employee can be heard and feel respected.
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to helping our employees and their families lead healthy productive lives. Our benefits packages and wellness programs help our employees succeed at work and at home. We offer comprehensive compensation and benefits packages designed to attract, retain and recognize our employees. We are committed to achieving pay equity and aligning rewards to performance. Our benefits program provides an array of flexible plans to meet the needs of eligible employees, which includes, among other things, medical, dental and vision plans, health management and incentive programs, flexible spending arrangements, life and disability insurance, retirement plans, work/life balance programs and an employee discount program including discounts on Scholastic products and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The ESPP provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase Scholastic common stock at a discount. We also provide eligible employees paid time off, in addition to volunteer hours to enable involvement in community action. 
Learning and Development
Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, retaining and developing employees and members of our management team. Our learning and development program enhances current and future organizational effectiveness by identifying skill gaps and assessing needs that can be supported by providing high quality educational and developmental programs that are strategic, measurable, effective, and serve to increase employees’ skills, knowledge, and effectiveness. In addition to annual trainings on key topics including compliance, ethics and integrity and information security, employees have access to the Scholastic Learning Center, a learning portal that includes self-paced online courses, books, and videos, as well as virtual and live instructor-led opportunities. Full and part-time employees also participate in an annual performance review process.
Health and Safety
The safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and community is a top priority. We have a safety program in place that focuses on policies and training programs to prevent injuries and incidents in the distribution centers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented additional safety measures in all our offices and facilities including work from home flexibility for non-site specific roles, enhanced cleaning protocols, and health monitoring and temperature screening of employees, in addition to offering onsite vaccine distribution at certain facilities or paid time allowances for employees to receive the vaccine from clinics and emotional support resources for employees impacted by COVID-19. We have also worked with outside safety experts to implement additional stringent protocols in delivering safe book fairs to schools, including training for our drivers and team members and a safety toolkit for all in-school fairs. We have committed resources regularly to review these policies and monitor compliance, while staying current with any new CDC recommendations.
