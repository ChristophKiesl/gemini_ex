Impact of COVID-19
In January 2020, the Company began to experience business disruptions in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) region as a result of COVID-19. In February 2020, the situation escalated as the scope of COVID-19 worsened beyond the APAC region, with the United States (the “U.S.”) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) experiencing significant outbreaks. In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to COVID-19, certain governments have imposed travel restrictions and local statutory quarantines and the Company has recommended associates who are able to perform their role remotely continue to do so. The Company is reacting to COVID-19 on a daily basis, including by conforming to local government guidance and monitoring developments in government legislation or other government actions in response to COVID-19. 
The extent of future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s business, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, are uncertain as current circumstances are dynamic and depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus and the availability and acceptance of effective vaccines or medical treatments.
As a result of COVID-19, in January 2020, the Company temporarily closed the majority of its stores in the APAC region and in March 2020, the Company temporarily closed its stores across brands in North America and the EMEA region. The majority of APAC stores were reopened during March 2020, and the Company began to reopen stores in North America and the EMEA region on a rolling basis in late April 2020. As of January 30, 2021 and March 24, 2021, approximately 88% and 91% of Company-operated stores were open for in-store service, respectively, with temporary store closures primarily in the EMEA region. The Company plans to follow the guidance of local governments to determine when it can reopen closed stores and to evaluate whether further store closures will be necessary.
The Company has also implemented a range of precautionary health and safety measures with the well-being of the Company’s customers, associates and business partners in mind, including:
•Requiring associates to use face coverings, depending on geographic region;
•Encouraging or requiring customers to use face coverings, depending on geographic region;
•Conducting associate wellness checks in accordance with local government direction;
•Enhancing cleaning routines and installing plexiglass barriers in the majority of store locations;
•Implementing various measures to encourage social distancing, including managing occupancy limits;
•Encouraging contactless payment options, where available;
•Opening fitting rooms where permissible, with additional cleaning procedures for clothing that has been tried on;
•Removing returned merchandise from the sales floor for a period of time where mandated by local government;
•Reducing store hours in select locations;
•Continuing to offer purchase-online-pickup-in-store;
•Increasing its omnichannel capabilities by introducing curbside pickup at a majority of U.S. locations; 
•Following recommended cleaning and distancing measures in the Company's distribution centers; and
•Maximizing work-from-home and digital collaboration alternatives to minimize in-person meetings whenever possible.
The Company has seen, and may continue to see, material reductions in sales across brands and regions as a result of COVID-19. Total net sales decreased approximately 14% for Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, primarily driven by temporary store closures and a decline in traffic as compared to the previous year as a result of COVID-19. During Fiscal 2020, sales for stores that had reopened were approximately 75% of Fiscal 2019 levels. The Company has experienced other material impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, deferred tax valuation allowances, long-lived asset impairment, adjustments of the carrying amount of inventory and changes in the effectiveness of its hedging instruments. 
The Company’s digital operations across brands have continued to serve the Company’s customers during this unprecedented period of temporary store closures as the Company’s distribution centers implemented enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures in order to remain operational. In response to elevated digital demand during this period, the Company has increased its omnichannel capabilities by continuing to offer purchase-online-pickup-in-store, including curbside pick-up at a majority of U.S. locations, and by utilizing ship-from-store capabilities. In addition, to prepare for the Fiscal 2020 holiday season, the Company entered into a short-term lease for an additional distribution center and partnered with incremental carriers. Digital net sales increased approximately 39% for Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, resulting in digital sales accounting for 54% of total revenues in Fiscal 2020 compared to 33% in Fiscal 2019. Despite the recent strength in digital sales, the Company has historically generated the majority of its annual net sales through stores and there can be no assurance that the current performance in the digital channel will continue.
The Company is also focused on managing inventories and the impacts COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on its global supply chain, including potential disruptions of product deliveries. The Company sources the majority of its merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with vendors primarily located in southeast Asia and, as of January 30, 2021, the vast majority of the factories the Company partners with were operating at full capacity. In order to complete production, these manufacturing factories are dependent on raw materials from fabric mills that are primarily located in the APAC region. The Company continues to collaborate with its third-party partners to mitigate significant delays in delivery of merchandise, especially in light of disruptions across the supply chain, including port congestion and shipping container shortages. During Fiscal 2020, the Company reduced certain orders that were not already in production, delayed and altered the cadence of deliveries and implemented various strategies to tightly manage inventories, including utilizing ship-from-store capabilities in select locations.
The Company’s progress executing against the following key transformation initiatives created the foundation to allow the Company to respond quickly to COVID-19 in Fiscal 2020:
•Optimizing the global store network;
•Enhancing digital and omnichannel capabilities;
•Increasing the speed and efficiency of the concept-to-customer product life cycle by further investing in capabilities to position the supply chain for greater speed, agility and efficiency, while leveraging data and analytics to offer the right product at the right time and the right price; and
•Improving customer engagement through loyalty programs and marketing optimization.
The Company entered Fiscal 2020 with a healthy liquidity position, however in light of COVID-19 the Company took immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including re-evaluating all expenditures, to balance short-term and long-term liquidity needs, in order to best position the business for the Company’s key stakeholders during Fiscal 2020. Actions to preserve liquidity and manage cash flows during Fiscal 2020, included, but were not limited to the following:
•Partnered with merchandise and non-merchandise vendors in regards to payment terms; 
•Managed inventory receipts tightly to align inventory with expected market demand;
•Reduced expenses to better align operating costs with sales; 
•Assessed government policy and economic stimulus responses to COVID-19 for both business and individuals;
•Borrowed $210.0 million under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in March 2020, which was then repaid in July 2020 along with the term loan facility;
•Withdrew $50.0 million from the overfunded Rabbi Trust assets, representing the majority of excess funds in March 2020;
•Announced the temporary suspension of the Company's share repurchase and dividend programs in March 2020 and May 2020, respectively; and
•Completed a private offering of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in July 2020.
Reflecting ongoing global uncertainty and the near-term challenges that COVID-19 presents, such as continued temporary store closures, uncertainty surrounding the global economy and customer discretionary spending habits, the Company plans to conservatively manage cash and liquidity in the first half of Fiscal 2021, while prioritizing investments in the business and continuing to fund operating activities. Regarding returns to shareholders, although the dividend program remains suspended, the Company recently announced that it plans to resume share repurchases beginning on or after March 4, 2021, dependent on 
various factors, such as market and business conditions, including the Company’s ability to accelerate investments in the business.
As of January 30, 2021, the Company had liquidity of $1.3 billion as compared to $0.9 billion as of February 1, 2020, comprised of cash and equivalents and borrowing available to the Company under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility.
Despite the Company's recent history of partnering with its vendors regarding payment terms, certain payment term extensions were temporary and certain previously deferred payments have since been made. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain extended payment terms or continue to defer payments, which may result in incremental operating cash outflows in future periods.

Navigating COVID-19
As discussed above under “Impact of COVID-19”, the Company’s progress executing against its key transformation initiatives prior to Fiscal 2020 created the foundation to allow the Company to respond quickly to COVID-19. The Company remains focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19, primarily by:

•Maintaining safety protocols across the Company’s corporate home offices, stores and distribution centers;

Long-term strategy
As the COVID-19 situation allows, the Company continues to evaluate opportunities to make progress on initiatives that position the business for sustainable long-term growth and align with its strategic pillars. The Company remains committed to meeting its customers’ needs whenever, wherever and however they choose to shop and works to accomplish this, in a rapidly evolving retail landscape, through the following pillars:

OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Omnichannel initiatives
As customer shopping preferences continue to shift and customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, the Company aims to create best-in-class customer experiences and grow total company profitability by delivering improvements through a continuous test-and-learn approach. While prior to Fiscal 2020, stores were the primary fulfillment point for orders, the Company experienced an acceleration in sales fulfilled through the digital channel in Fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19. Despite, this acceleration in channel shift, stores continue to be an important part of the customers’ omnichannel experience and the Company believes that the customers’ experience is improved by its offering of omnichannel capabilities, which include: 
•Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store, allowing customers to purchase merchandise through one of the Company’s websites or mobile apps and pick-up the merchandise in store, which often times drives incremental in-store sales;
•Curbside pickup, allowing customers to engage with the Company’s brands while encouraging social distancing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•Order-in-Store, allowing customers to shop the brands’ in-store and online offerings while in-store;
•Reserve-in-Store, allowing customers to reserve merchandise online and try it on in-store before purchase;
•Ship-from-Store, which allows the Company to ship in-store merchandise to customers and increases inventory productivity; and
•Cross-channel returns, allowing customers to return merchandise purchased through one channel to a different channel.
The Company also believes that its loyalty programs, Hollister’s Club Cali® and Abercrombie’s myAbercrombie®, are important parts of its omnichannel strategy as the Company aims to seamlessly interact and connect with customers across all touchpoints through members-only offers, items and experiences. Under these programs, customers accumulate points primarily based on purchase activity and earn rewards as points are converted at certain thresholds. These rewards can be redeemed for merchandise discounts either in-store or online. The loyalty programs continue to provide timely customer insights and the Company believes these programs contribute to higher average transaction value.
Digital operations
In order to create a more seamless shopping experience for its customers, the Company continues to invest in its digital infrastructure. The Company has the capability to ship merchandise to customers in more than 110 countries and process transactions in 28 currencies and through 28 forms of payment globally. The Company operates desktop and mobile websites for its brands globally, which are available in various local languages, and four mobile apps. In addition, in its efforts to expand its international brand reach, the Company also partners with certain third-party e-commerce platforms. The Company continues to develop its mobile capabilities as mobile engagement continues to grow, with over 80% of the Company’s digital traffic generated from mobile devices in Fiscal 2020. 
Store operations
The Company continues to thoughtfully open new stores and invest in smaller omni-enabled store experiences that align with local customer shopping preferences as stores are a critical part of the omnichannel brand experience. During Fiscal 2020, the Company opened 15 new store locations, remodeled four store locations and right-sized an additional six store locations. Hollister and Abercrombie both have stores in updated formats, which are designed to be open and inviting, and include accommodating features such as innovative fitting rooms and omnichannel capabilities. These stores are tailored to reflect the personality of each brand, with unique furniture, fixtures, music and scent adding to a rich brand experience. The Company’s stores continue to play an essential role in creating brand awareness serving as physical gateways to the brands. Stores also serve as local hubs for online engagement as the Company continues to grow its omnichannel capabilities to create seamless shopping experiences. 
The Company continues to evaluate and manage its store fleet through its ongoing global store network optimization initiative and has taken actions to optimize store productivity by remodeling, right-sizing or relocating stores to smaller square footage locations, and closing stores. As part of this initiative, the Company closed eight flagship locations during Fiscal 2020, leaving the Company with seven operating flagships at the end of Fiscal 2020, down from 15 at the beginning of the year. In addition, the Company closed 129 non-flagship locations, resulting in 137 total store closures during Fiscal 2020. These actions reduced total Company store gross square footage by approximately 1.1 million gross square feet, or 17%, as compared to Fiscal 2019 year-end. The actions taken in Fiscal 2020, combined with ongoing digital sales growth, are expected to continue to transform the Company's operating model and reposition the Company for the future as the Company continues to focus on aligning store square footage with digital penetration.
All of the retail stores operated by the Company, as of January 30, 2021, are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers. These leases generally have initial terms of between five and ten years. Certain leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. The leases expire at various dates between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2030.
As of January 30, 2021, the Company operated 735 retail stores as detailed in the table below:

 | Hollister (1) | Abercrombie (2) | | Total (3)
Europe | 107 | | 16 | | 123

For store count and gross square footage by brand and geographic region as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, refer to “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.”
Third-party operations
The Company continues to expand its international brand reach, create brand awareness and develop local expertise through various wholesale, franchise, licensing and consignment arrangements. As of January 30, 2021, the Company had eight wholesale partnerships, primarily internationally. As of January 30, 2021, the Company’s franchisees operated 19 international franchise stores across the brands located in Mexico, Qatar and Saudi Arabia and one multi-brand consignment outlet in China.
SOURCING OF MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
The Company works with its network of third-party vendors to supply compelling, on-trend and high-quality product assortments to its customers. These vendors are expected to respect local laws and have committed to follow the standards set forth in the Company’s Vendor Code of Conduct, which details the Company’s dedication to human rights, labor rights, environmental responsibility and workplace safety.
The Company sourced merchandise through approximately 100 vendors located in 17 countries, including the U.S., during Fiscal 2020. The Company’s largest vendor accounted for approximately 13% of merchandise sourced in Fiscal 2020, based on the cost of sourced merchandise. The Company believes its product sourcing is appropriately distributed among vendors. 
Refer to Note 6, “INVENTORIES,” for a summary of inventory sourced based on vendor location and dollar cost of merchandise receipts during Fiscal 2020.
DISTRIBUTION OF MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
The Company’s distribution network is built to deliver inventory to Company-operated and international franchise stores and fulfill digital and wholesale orders with speed and efficiency. Generally, merchandise is shipped directly from vendors to the Company’s distribution centers, where it is received and inspected before being shipped to the Company’s stores or its digital or wholesale customers.
The Company relies on its distribution centers to manage the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of its merchandise. Additional information pertaining to certain of the Company’s distribution centers as of January 30, 2021 follows:

Location | Company-owned or third-party
New Albany, Ohio (Primarily serves store and digital operations) | Company-owned 
New Albany, Ohio (Serves only digital operations) | Company-owned 
Bergen op Zoom, Netherlands | Third-party 
Shanghai, China | Third-party 

In addition, during Fiscal 2019, the Company entered into an agreement for a facility to be located in the Phoenix, Arizona area, with services expected to commence in Fiscal 2021, which is intended to replace the Company’s third-party distribution center in Reno, Nevada to increase capacity and improve fulfillment capabilities.
In Fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a short-term lease for an additional distribution center, which has since ended, and diversified its distribution network to mitigate risk from carrier capacity shortages in light of COVID-19, particularly during the Fiscal 2020 holiday season. The Company primarily used four contract carriers to ship merchandise and related materials to its North American customers, and several contract carriers for its international customers during Fiscal 2020.
COMPETITION
The Company operates in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive retail business environment. Competitors include: individual and chain specialty apparel retailers; local, regional, national and international department stores; discount stores; and online- exclusive businesses. Additionally, the Company competes for consumers’ discretionary spend with businesses in other product and experiential categories such as technology, restaurants, travel and media content. 
The Company competes primarily on the basis of differentiating its brands from competition through: product, higher quality and increased newness; brand voice, amplifying and consolidating brand messaging; and experience, investing in immersive, participatory omnichannel shopping environments.
Operating in a highly competitive industry environment can cause the Company to engage in greater than expected promotional activity, which would result in pressure on average unit retail and gross profit. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - Our failure to operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry could have a material adverse impact on our business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential impacts competition may have on the Company. 
SEASONAL BUSINESS
Historically, the Company’s operations have been seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters (“Spring”) and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters (“Fall”). The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during Fall, due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales 
periods. Refer to “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

In addition, these trademarks are either registered, or the Company has applications for registration pending, with the registries of many of the foreign countries in which the manufacturers of the Company’s products are located. The Company has also registered, or has applied to register, certain other trademarks in the U.S. and around the world. The Company believes its products are identified by its trademarks and, therefore, its trademarks are of significant value. Each registered trademark has a duration of 10 to 20 years, depending on the date it was registered, and the country in which it is registered, and is subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon continued use and appropriate application. The Company intends to continue using its core trademarks and to timely renew each of its registered trademarks that remain in use.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS

These systems include applications related to point-of-sale, digital operations, inventory management, supply chain, planning, sourcing, merchandising, payroll, scheduling and financial reporting. The Company continues to invest in technology to upgrade its core systems to create efficiencies and to support its digital operations, omnichannel capabilities, customer relationship management tools and loyalty programs.
WORKING CAPITAL
Refer to “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company’s cash requirements and sources of cash available for working capital needs and investment opportunities.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company strives to create a culture that not only drives strategic and key business priorities forward, but also encourages associates to create a positive impact in their communities. The Company believes that the strength of its unique culture is a competitive advantage, and intends to continue building upon that culture to improve performance across its business. This will become even more important as the Company expands globally and works towards achieving its long-term vision of becoming a leading digital-first omnichannel global apparel retailer.
Therefore, the Company believes that the attraction, retention, and management of qualified talent representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets, and fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment is integral to its success in advancing the Company’s strategies and key business priorities and avoiding disruptions in the business. The Company relies on its associates across the organization, including those at its corporate offices, stores, and distribution centers, as well as their experience and expertise in the retail business. Examples of key initiatives that are focused to attract, retain, and manage the Company’s human capital resources include the following: 
•Offering competitive compensation and benefits, including cash-based and equity-based incentive awards in order to align the interests of associates and shareholders. 
•Improving associate engagement through open communication channels and focusing on development. The Company regularly holds all-company meetings to communicate with its associates and collects feedback through various surveys to better understand associate experience and drive improvements. The Company also strives to provide a wide variety of development opportunities throughout associates’ careers in order to be able to pivot resources to align with overall corporate strategies when necessary. 
•Embracing diversity and inclusion in all forms, including gender, race, ethnicity, disability, nationality, religion, age, veteran, LGBTQIA+ status and other factors. The Company continuously reviews representation, pay and promotion among associates with diverse backgrounds, including those in senior leadership positions. The Company also encourages associates to enhance their understanding of diversity and inclusion through the Company’s various associate resource groups which allow associates from different business functions around the world to discuss relevant topics and help address regional-specific needs. Additionally, the Company invests in year-round competency building training for associates on topics of bias, allyship and advocacy. 
•Encouraging community involvement by promoting various charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs, which fosters a collaborative and rewarding work environment. 
•Focusing on the health and safety of its associates by investing in various wellness programs throughout the year that are designed to enhance the physical, financial, and mental well-being of its associates globally. Refer to "Impact of COVID-19" included in “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on actions taken by the Company to support its associates during COVID-19. 
The Company employed approximately 34,000 associates globally as of January 30, 2021, of whom approximately 26,900 were part-time associates. As of January 30, 2021, the Company employed approximately 25,000 associates in the U.S., and employed approximately 9,000 associates outside of the U.S. The Company employs temporary, seasonal associates at times, particularly during Fall, when it experiences its greatest sales activity due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods. 
The number of associates represented by workers’ councils and unions is not significant and is generally limited to associates in the Company’s European stores. 
Board oversight
A&F’s Board of Directors and its committees also play an integral role in the Company’s human capital management. For example, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of the Company’s attention to issues of social responsibility, including diversity and inclusion, health and safety, human rights, environmental and philanthropy and the Company’s policies, practices and progress with respect to such issues. This includes overseeing, making recommendations and evaluating the success of the Company’s diversity and inclusion policies and programs, while monitoring current trends and opportunities in corporate diversity outreach. In addition, among other things, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s overall compensation structure, policies and programs, as well as reviews and approves metrics to be used for the determination of payouts under cash-based and equity-based incentive programs. Members of the Board of Directors also review succession plans for the Company’s executive officers and discuss with senior leadership the Company’s organizational structure and key reporting relationships, along with development of strategies and practices relating to recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s associates as needed.
