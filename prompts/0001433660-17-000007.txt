BUSINESS SEGMENTS
JBT FoodTech
JBT FoodTech supplies both customized industrial and turnkey solutions and services used in the food and beverage industry. We design, manufacture and service technologically sophisticated food processing systems for the preparation of meat, seafood and poultry products, ready-to-eat meals, shelf stable packaged foods, bakery products, juice and dairy products, and fruit and vegetable products.
We believe our success is derived from our continued innovation, applying our differentiated and proprietary technologies to meet our customers’ food processing needs. We continually strive to improve our existing solutions and develop new solutions by working closely with our customers to meet their evolving needs.

Our historically strong position in the markets we serve has provided us with a large installed base of systems and equipment. We deliver industrial capacity equipment which includes freezers, citrus juice extractors, preservation systems, coating systems and packaging systems. The installed base of our equipment provides a stream of recurring revenue from aftermarket products, parts, services, and lease arrangements. Recurring revenue accounted for 40% of our FoodTech total revenue in 2016. Our installed base also provides us with strong, long-term customer relationships from which we derive information for new product development to meet the evolving needs of our food processing customers. We also provide stand-alone and fully integrated automated guided vehicle systems for repetitive material handling requirements, for example in manufacturing and warehouse facilities.
We have operations strategically positioned around the world to serve our existing JBT FoodTech equipment base located in more than 100 countries. Our principal production facilities are located in the United States (Arkansas, California, Florida, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin), Brazil, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, South Africa and China. In addition to sales and services offices based in more than 25 countries, we also support our customers in their development of new food products and processes as well as the refinement and testing of their current applications through eleven technical centers located in the United States (California, Florida, and Ohio), Mexico, Brazil, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and China. Our global presence allows us to provide direct customized support to customers virtually anywhere they process foods.
Solutions, Products and Services
We offer a broad portfolio of systems, equipment and services to our customers which are often sold as part of a fully integrated processing line solution. Our systems are typically customized to meet the specific customer application needs. Thus, actual production capacity ranges vary and are dependent on the food and product packaging type being processed.
Protein. Our fully integrated processing lines often span from the initial point of entry of raw products through further processing. Our Protein systems include Wolf-Tec Polar Dissolver brine preparation, IMAX injection, Polar Massager marination, Polar Flex Carve maceration, TMAX tenderization, TVI portion cutting systems, the DSI™ waterjet portioners, slicers and attribute scanner/sorters; the Stein™ coating and seasoning applicators, teflon coated Formcook Contact and Combi Cookers, THERMoFIN® fryers, GYRoCOMPACT® spiral ovens, JSO Jet Stream® ovens; Double D™ Revoband™ linear ovens and cooking systems; Novus X-ray systems; C.A.T. FATCAT chillers, ULTRACAT injectors, scales and weighing systems, GLACIERCAT freezers and Tipper Tie Clip packaging systems. Although our solutions are primarily used in the processing of meat and poultry (including nuggets, strips, and wings), we also provide systems that portion, coat or cook other food products ranging from breads and pizzas, seafood, and ready-to-eat meals to pet food. Through our acquisition of Tipper Tie, Inc. we also serve industrial, non-food customers, primarily for the adhesives, glues, silicone and industrial explosives industries. 
With our first commercial food processing developed in the 1960s, we remain a leading supplier of freezing and chilling solutions to the food processing industry. We design, assemble, test, and install industry-leading technologies under the Frigoscandia® brand, which include the GYRoCOMPACT® self-stacking spiral, the FLoFREEZE® individual quick freezing (IQF) system, and the ADVANTEC™ linear/impingement freezing system, as well as flat product and contact freezers, chillers and proofers. We also offer a structure-supported Northfield SuperTRAK® spiral freezer for high volume, large packaged products. Our freezers are designed to meet the most stringent demands for quality, economy, food safety and user-friendliness. Our industrial freezers can be found in plants that are processing food products ranging from meat, seafood, and poultry to bakery products and ready-to-eat meals, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. 
In 2016, we acquired the Novus X-ray, Cooling and Applied Technologies (C.A.T.), and Tipper Tie businesses. Novus X-ray specializes in the manufacture of modular X-ray systems, allowing us to enter the growing market for automated food inspection equipment. The acquisition of Cooling and Applied Technologies added chillers and weighing systems to our portfolio of poultry processing capabilities as well as strengthened our offering of injectors and freezers.
Protein technology offerings accounted for 30% of our total revenue in 2016. 
Liquid Foods. We offer comprehensive processing lines from primary juice extraction through end of line packaging. In the primary space, we supply industrial citrus processing equipment.

Our tomato processing lines are installed with processors throughout the world’s key tomato growing regions and produce a range of finished tomato products including tomato paste, concentrates, peeled tomato products, diced tomatoes, salsa, pizza sauce, ketchup, and pureed and crushed tomatoes. Our aseptic processing lines are used in the bulk processing of a wide range of temperate and tropical fruits into juices, particulates, purees, and concentrates. These fruit products are used as ingredients for dairy products (yogurts, smoothies, flavored milk, and ice cream), bakery products, and fruit-based beverages.
We provide technology solutions and products to extend the life, improve the appearance and preserve the taste of fresh fruits and vegetables. Once protected, fresh fruits and vegetables can be individually labeled by our fast and efficient produce labeling systems. We also provide an integrated equipment and aftermarket service program, including the patented Bin Scrubber System, the Single Pass Dryer and Smart Dryer System, and additional ancillary produce processing technologies.

We may also be subject to civil claims arising out of an accident or other event causing environmental pollution. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for our own acts even though these actions were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. 
Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA, and related state laws and regulations, joint and several liability can be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a contaminated site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, and including hazardous substances generated by any closed operations or facilities. In addition, neighboring landowners or other third parties may file claims for personal injury, property damage, and recovery of response cost. We may also be subject to the corrective action provisions of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste to clean up releases of hazardous waste constituents into the environment associated with their operations.
Some of our facilities and operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to worker health and workplace safety, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA. We believe that appropriate precautions are taken to protect 
9

our employees and others from harmful exposure to potentially hazardous materials handled and managed at our facilities, and that we operate in substantial compliance with all OSHA or similar regulations.
