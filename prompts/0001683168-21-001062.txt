--------+---------

Overview
    Phio Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Phio,” “we,” “our” or the “Company”) is a biotechnology company developing the next generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics based on its self-delivering RNAi (“INTASYL™”) therapeutic platform. The Company's efforts are focused on silencing tumor-induced suppression of the immune system through its proprietary INTASYL platform with utility in immune cells and the tumor micro-environment. The Company’s goal is to develop powerful INTASYL therapeutic compounds that can weaponize immune effector cells to overcome tumor immune escape, thereby potentially providing patients a powerful new treatment option that goes beyond current treatment modalities.
Our Development Pipeline
 
We have developed a product platform based on our INTASYL technology that allows easy, precise, rapid, and selective non-genetically modified programming of adoptive cell therapy (“ACT”) cells (ex vivo, during manufacturing) and of the tumor micro-environment (the “TME”) (in vivo, by local application), resulting in reduced immune inhibition and in improved immunotherapy. The table below sets forth the Company’s stage of development for its programs and product candidates:

We believe our INTASYL platform uniquely positions the Company in the field of immuno-oncology for the following reasons:
 

· | Efficient uptake of INTASYL by target cells obviating the need for facilitated delivery (mechanical or formulation);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Does not require permanent genetic modification; 


· | Can target multiple genes (i.e. multiple immunosuppression pathways) in a single therapeutic entity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gene silencing by INTASYL has been shown to have a sustained, or long-term, effect in vivo;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Favorable clinical safety profile of INTASYL with local administration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Can be readily manufactured under current good manufacturing practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The self-delivering nature of our compounds makes INTASYL ideally suited for use with ACT treatments as well as for direct therapeutic use. ACT consists of the infusion of immune cells with antitumor properties, after growing them in a lab to large numbers. These cells can be derived from unmodified (i.e. naturally occurring) immune cells, immune cells isolated from resected tumors, or genetically engineered immune cells that recognize tumor cells. Regardless of the source of immune cells (ACT or naturally occurring immune cells), in patients with solid tumors, these cells have several shortcomings that inhibit their full therapeutic potential. By using INTASYL technology during the manufacturing of such ACT cell products we can improve the phenotype and function of these cells, potentially leading to better therapeutic outcomes. Multiple inhibitory mechanisms restrain immune cells from effectively eradicating tumors, including immune checkpoints, reduced cell fitness and cell persistence. Furthermore, the immunosuppressive TME can pose a formidable barrier to immune cell infiltration and function. By using INTASYL based drugs administered directly, we can reprogram cells in the TME to help overcome these immunosuppressive mechanisms.
 
INTASYL Use To Improve Adoptive Cell Therapy Products 
 
ACT is a form of immune therapy based on the use of immune cells, isolated from patients, donors or retrieved from allogeneic immune cell banks. They are grown in a lab to large numbers, followed by administering them to the patient to fight cancer. Sometimes, immune cells that naturally recognize a tumor are used, while other times immune cells are modified or “genetically engineered” to make them recognize and kill the cancer cells. There are several types of ACT, including: a.) non-engineered cell therapy in which immune cells are grown from the patient’s tumor or blood, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (“TILs”), or from donor blood or tissue such as natural killer (“NK”) cells, dendritic cells (“DC”) and macrophages, and b.) genetically engineered immune cells that are genetically modified to recognize specific tumor proteins and to remain in an activated state (such as T cell receptor technology (“TCRs”), chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T cells, or CAR-NK cells).
 
Multiple inhibitory mechanisms restrain immune cells used in ACT from effectively eradicating tumors, including immune checkpoints, reduced cell fitness and cell persistence, and other barriers to immune cell infiltration and function mainly in solid tumors. We believe our INTASYL compounds are ideally suited to be used in ACT products. With INTASYL compounds, we can unlock the full potential of ACT, by improving the immune cell function, differentiation and metabolism, in order to make these immune cells more effective without the need for additional complicated manufacturing steps and/or genetic engineering.

Our approach builds on well-established methodologies of ACT and involves the treatment of immune cells with our INTASYL compounds ex vivo while they are grown in the lab and before administering them to the patient. Because our INTASYL compounds do not require a delivery vehicle to penetrate into the cells, we are able to enhance the function of these cells by merely adding our INTASYL compounds during the expansion process and without the need for genetic engineering, without the need for complex delivery vehicles or formulations, and without additional needed complex manufacturing steps. By adding INTASYL to the cell culture media used during the cell expansion, we can reduce or eliminate the expression of genes that make the immune cells less effective. For example, with our INTASYL compounds, we can reduce the expression of immunosuppressive proteins by the therapeutic immune cells, potentially enabling them to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms and thus improving their ability to destroy the tumor cells. In various types of immune cells tested to date, INTASYL treatment results in potent silencing with close to 100% transfection efficiency and while maintaining nearly full cell viability. After expanding these cells and enhancing them with INTASYL ex vivo, they are returned to the patient for treatment.



Considering the significant growth of cell-based immunotherapy, a technology that can reprogram the immune cells used in ACT, such as INTASYL technology, is of key interest. In comparison to other technologies available, reprogramming cells with INTASYL does not require genetic engineering, its use is not limited to specific cell types and it can be easily integrated with cell manufacturing approaches.
 
Our lead product candidate and most advanced program being developed in ACT is PH-762, an INTASYL compound that targets the checkpoint protein PD-1. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1, normally act as a type of “off switch” that prevent T cells from attacking certain cells, such as cancer cells, in the body. Our T cells are immune cells that protect the body from cancer cells and infections.
 
Data developed by Phio and with collaborators has shown that PH-762 silences PD-1 checkpoint expression, thereby removing the “off switch” and resulting in enhanced T cell activation and tumor cytotoxicity. Experimental data shows that PH-762 can silence the expression of PD-1 in target human T cells in a potent and durable manner, and can increase the function of patient derived TILs for use in ACT, showing that PH-762 is applicable for use in both ACT and as a standalone direct therapeutic.

In March 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a clinical development collaboration with AgonOx, Inc. (“AgonOx”), a private company developing a pipeline of novel immunotherapy drugs targeting key regulators of the immune response to cancer. Under the agreement, the companies will collaborate on the development of novel T cell-based therapies using PH-762 and AgonOx’s “double positive” (DP) TIL technology. AgonOx has demonstrated that their DP CD8+ T cells isolated from human solid tumors (DP TILs) have increased tumor killing activity when compared to TILs that were not enriched prior to expansion. Preclinical data from AgonOx in collaboration with Phio has shown that treating DP TIL with PH-762 increases the tumor killing activity of the DP TILs even further (a two-fold increase). As a result, the use of PH-762 treated DP TILs is expected to enhance therapeutic responses in cancer data. Based on these data showing that the combination of our technologies can result in TIL therapeutics, our collaboration will focus on conducting a clinical study for PH-762 treated DP TILs. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, AgonOx will receive financial support for the clinical trial from Phio and Phio will be entitled to certain future development milestones and sales-related royalty payments from AgonOx’s DP TIL technology. The clinical trial in ACT with PH-762 and AgonOx’s DP TIL technology is expected to start in the third quarter of 2021.
 
Our second product candidate in ACT is PH-894, an INTASYL compound that targets BRD4 which is a regulator of gene expression impacting cell differentiation. In previous studies, PH-894 has been shown to improve T cell function and persistence by differentiating T cells into a more active state (stem-cell like memory phenotype). Data, completed in partnership with the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, demonstrated that the application of PH-894, was shown to silence BRD4 in human T cells during expansion for ACT, which has the potential to confer superior anti-tumor activity, for example by improving T cell persistence. With this data, we expanded our collaboration with the Karolinska Institutet to build upon these findings and develop INTASYL compounds for additional targets and cell types toward clinical application in areas of the Karolinska Institutet’s ongoing clinical research.
 
We are also developing our INTASYL compound PH-804 for use in ACT. PH-804 targets the suppressive immune receptor TIGIT, which is a checkpoint protein present on T cells and NK cells. We have shown that PH-804 can silence the expression of TIGIT in NK cells and T cells, overcoming their “off switch” and the cells becoming “weaponized” to kill cancer cells.
 
Direct Therapeutic Use of INTASYL Towards the Tumor Micro-Environment
 
The TME is the environment that surrounds and feeds a tumor, including normal cells, blood vessels, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. The TME is an immunosuppressive environment that inhibits the immune system’s natural ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells by negatively impacting how immunosuppressive cells are being attracted and activated. Reprogramming different components of the TME may overcome resistance to immunotherapy. Such reprogramming of the TME by INTASYL compounds through direct local administration into the tumor, could potentially become an important form of therapy. The Company has previously shown in a clinical setting that our INTASYL compounds are safe and well-tolerated following local administration, therefore we believe that our INTASYL technology can not only be used with ACT, but can also be used as an independent therapeutic platform.

We are developing our PH-762, PH-894 and PH-804 INTASYL compounds also for use as direct therapeutics to reprogram the TME through in situ transfection and activation of immune cells in the TME.
 
Animal studies conducted by the Company showed that local administration of PH-894 or the mouse version of PH-762 through intra-tumoral injection resulted in potent anti-tumoral effects. The treated animals showed a complete and statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth, whereas placebo treated animals displayed exponential tumor growth. In vivo studies performed by the Company with PH-804 showed that intra-tumoral injection of a mouse version of PH-804 reduced the tumor growth in colorectal carcinoma tumor bearing mice, which was shown to inhibit tumor growth and was correlated with the silencing of TIGIT mRNA expression and in increase in cytotoxic effector T cells in the TME.
 
The combined PH-804, PH-762, and PH-894 data further shows that INTASYL compounds can trigger associated changes in the TME such as an increase of TILs, including CD8+ T cells responsible for tumor cell killing, and an increase of activation markers on these cells. These preclinical findings demonstrate that direct injection of INTASYL compounds can successfully infiltrate solid tumors and impact the TME by activating the immune response in animal models of solid tumors resulting in reduced tumor growth. A key challenge for many other immunotherapy platforms is to be able to achieve an adequate therapeutic effect in solid tumors with an acceptable safety profile. Many of the available systemic immuno-therapeutics indeed come with dose limiting immune-related adverse events, which we believe can be mitigated with local INTASYL treatment.
 
Based on our positive preclinical data, the Company is preparing for a clinical study with PH-762 using intra-tumoral administration for patients with advanced melanoma. The required preclinical studies and steps needed to initiate the clinical trial with PH-762 as a direct therapeutic are continuing and ongoing. The clinical trial will be conducted at the Gustave Roussy Institute, which is France’s largest cancer center and Dr. Caroline Robert will be our lead principal investigator. The Company expects to start the clinical trial evaluating the use of PH-762 as a direct therapeutic in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
We are also investigating other relevant compounds for TME targets, such as PH-790, an INTASYL compound targeting PD-L1. PD-L1 is a protein formed by cancer cells that activate the PD-1 “off switch” on immune cells. Our approach with PH-790 is to block the formation of the PD-L1 protein, which may prevent cancer cells from inactivating T cells and attack the cancer. Recent data presented demonstrated that the antitumoral efficacy of our individual pipeline products, PH-762, PH-790 and PH-804, can be further improved by combining them in a single drug treatment. We have shown that, in contrast to other technology platforms, we can efficiently target multiple proteins, in a single drug treatment without negative consequences related to the potency of the individual components. Animal data showed that the combination of our INTASYL compounds in a single formulation (at suboptimal doses of the individual agents) inhibited tumor growth without having a negative impact on the tolerability of the treatment.
 
Our INTASYL Platform 
 
Our development efforts are based on our broadly patented INTASYL technology platform. Our INTASYL compounds do not require a delivery vehicle to penetrate into tissues and cells and are designed to “silence” or down-regulate, the expression of a specific gene which is over-expressed in cancer.

 
Diseases are often related to the wrong protein being made, excessive amounts of a specific protein being made, or the correct protein being made but at the wrong location or time. Overall, RNA is involved in the synthesis, regulation and expression of proteins. RNA interference (“RNAi’) is a biological process in which specific RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation into proteins. RNAi offers a novel approach to drug development because RNAi compounds can be designed to silence any one of the thousands of human genes, many of which are “undruggable” by other modalities. The potential of RNAi as a powerful drug development platform has been shown by several RNAi based drugs becoming approved over the last few years.

The first design of RNAi compounds to be pursued for the development of human therapeutics were short, double-stranded RNAs that included limited modifications, known as small-interfering RNA (“siRNA”). Since the initial discovery of RNAi, drug delivery has been the primary challenge in developing RNAi-based therapeutics. One solution to the delivery problem involves encapsulation of siRNA into a lipid-based formulations, such as liposomes, to improve cellular uptake. Another approach is to use chemical conjugations of a ligand, such as GalNAC, for cell specific delivery limited to hepatocytes. We have developed an alternative approach where delivery and drug-like properties are built directly into the RNAi compound itself, whereby the RNAi uptake is neither dependent on complex formulation nor limited to addressing a specific cell type. These novel compounds are termed self-delivering RNAi compounds, or INTASYL.
 
Our INTASYL compounds are hybrid oligonucleotide compounds that the Company believes combines the beneficial properties of both conventional RNAi and antisense technologies. In an attempt to combine the best properties of both technologies, INTASYL compounds have a single-stranded phosphorothioate region, a short duplex region, and contain a variety of nuclease-stabilizing and lipophilic chemical modifications. The combination of these features allows INTASYL compounds to achieve efficient spontaneous cellular uptake and potent, long-lasting intracellular activity.
 

The key to therapeutic success with RNAi lies in delivering intact RNAi compounds to the target tissue and the interior of the target cells. To accomplish this, our chemically synthesized INTASYL compounds are optimized for stability and efficacy and have unique properties that improve tissue and cell uptake.

Intellectual Property
 
We protect our proprietary information by means of United States and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products. We have pending patent applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, methods of making or using those compounds and proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform.
 
Much of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us.
 
We have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties, which require us to pay royalties, milestone payments, or both. The degree of patent protection for biotechnology products and processes, including ours, remains uncertain, both in the United States and in other important markets, because the scope of protection depends on decisions of patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. There is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if obtained, will afford us substantial protection or commercial benefit. Similarly, there is no assurance that our pending patent applications or patent applications licensed from third parties will ultimately be granted as patents or that those patents that have been issued or are issued in the future will stand if they are challenged in court. We assess our license agreements on an ongoing basis and may from time to time terminate licenses to technology that we do not intend to employ in our technology platforms, or in our product discovery or development activities.

Government Regulation
 
The United States and many other countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products under the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations.
 
To obtain approval of our future product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems at any time following initial marketing of our products.
 
The first stage of the FDA approval process for a new biologic or drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the FDA. These data, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other information submitted to the FDA in an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. Preclinical studies generally involve FDA regulated laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product candidate.
 
After the IND becomes effective, a company may commence human clinical trials. These are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing the product candidate in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at multiple test sites. A company must submit to the FDA a clinical protocol, accompanied by the approval of the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at the institutions participating in the trials, prior to commencement of each clinical trial.

To obtain FDA marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, in the form of a new drug application (“NDA”), or, in the case of a biologic, a biologics license application (“BLA”).
 
The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question and the workload at the FDA.
 
The FDA may, in some cases, confer upon an investigational product the status of a fast track product. A fast track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. The FDA can base approval of an NDA or BLA for a fast track product on an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. If a preliminary review of clinical data suggests that a fast track product may be effective, the FDA may initiate review of entire sections of a marketing application for a fast track product before the sponsor completes the application.
 
We anticipate that our products will be manufactured by our strategic partners, licensees or other third parties. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice regulations (“cGMP”), which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general biological product standards. Our manufacturers also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other applicable environmental statutes. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the cGMP. Our manufacturers will have to continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
 
The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. We also will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products and deny or withdraw approvals.
 
We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the United States.
 
Environmental Compliance 
 
Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements.
