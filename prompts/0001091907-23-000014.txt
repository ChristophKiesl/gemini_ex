Business Overview
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. is an integrated media and entertainment company. We have been involved in the sports entertainment business for four decades, and have developed WWE into one of the most popular brands in global entertainment today. We are principally engaged in the production and distribution of unique and creative content through various channels, including content rights agreements for our flagship programs, Raw and SmackDown, and our premium over-the-top network (“WWE Network”), premium live event programming, monetization across social media outlets, live events, licensing of various WWE themed products, and the sale of merchandise at our live events. At the heart of our success are the athletic and entertainment skills and appeal of our Superstars, and our consistently innovative and multi-faceted storylines. Our distribution platforms provide significant cross-promotion and marketing opportunities that reinforce our brands while effectively reaching our fans.
Based on the strength of the Company’s brands and its ownership and control over its intellectual property, the Company has been able to leverage its content and talent globally across virtually all media platforms. We continually evaluate additional opportunities to monetize new and existing content. 
Our operations are organized around the following principal activities:
Media:
The Media segment reflects the production and monetization of long-form and short-form video content across various platforms, including broadcast and pay television and streaming, as well as digital and social media. Across these platforms, revenues principally consist of content rights fees associated with the distribution of our programming content, subscriptions to WWE Network, and advertising and sponsorships. 
Live Events:
Live events provide ongoing content for our media platforms. Live Event segment revenues consist primarily of ticket sales, as well as revenues from events for which we receive a fixed fee and the sale of travel packages associated with the Company’s global live events. As a result of the global spread of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), these revenues 

 

had been greatly limited from March 2020 through the first half of 2021. In July 2021, we resumed our domestic and international live event touring schedules.
Consumer Products:
The Consumer Products segment engages in the merchandising of WWE branded products, such as video games, toys and apparel, through licensing arrangements and direct-to-consumer sales. Revenues principally consist of royalties and licensee fees related to WWE branded products and sales of merchandise distributed at our live events and through eCommerce platforms. Beginning July 2022, we launched an exclusive, multi-year partnership with Fanatics, Inc. (“Fanatics”) to create a new, enhanced experience for WWE fans globally, and transitioned our digital retail platform to Fanatics.
Media
Media net revenues were $1,033.9 million, $936.2 million and $868.2 million, representing 80%, 85% and 89% of total net revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Network
WWE Network launched in February 2014, becoming the first-ever 24/7 live streaming direct-to-consumer network. In addition to our premium live events, WWE Network content also includes second runs of our in-ring television programming, exclusive original programming, groundbreaking documentaries, reality shows and in-ring specials, including Table for 3, Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Sessions and WWE’s The Bump. Our strategy of creating compelling original content has contributed to the popularity of WWE Network, which premiered nearly 550 hours of original content during 2022. 
In March 2021, the Peacock paid streaming service became the exclusive home to WWE Network in the United States in connection with a multi-year license agreement with Peacock TV LLC (“Peacock”). Network revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 include the upfront revenue recognition related to the delivery of certain intellectual property rights under this agreement. During 2022, the Company entered into agreements to license WWE Network content in certain international markets, including agreements with MBC in the Middle East, Foxtel in Australia and MultiChoice in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Our subscription-based WWE Network continues to be available in certain international markets (excluding embargoed countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, among others. 
Core Content Rights Fees
Leveraging our expertise in live event television production, we currently produce seven hours of original weekly domestic television programming, RAW, SmackDown and NXT, our core content. RAW and NXT are licensed domestically to NBCU, while SmackDown is licensed domestically to Fox Network. We also distribute second runs of RAW and NXT to Hulu, which are available after the original first run airing dates on television, along with a wide selection of other WWE content.
RAW is a three-hour live primetime program airing on Mondays. It ranks among the most watched regularly scheduled programs on primetime cable television. RAW is the longest running weekly episodic program in primetime television history, with over 1,500 original episodes, and anchors USA Network’s programming line-up, consistently helping make it the top-rated cable entertainment network.
SmackDown is a two-hour live primetime program airing on Fridays on Fox Network and ranks among the most watched timeslots in the 18 to 49 demographic on Friday nights. SmackDown is the second longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, second only to RAW. 
NXT is a two-hour live primetime program airing on Tuesday nights on USA Network. The weekly program continues to air on WWE Network shortly after its initial run on USA Network.
The Company anticipates that during 2023 it will be involved in negotiations to renew or replace its domestic television distribution rights agreements for RAW, SmackDown and NXT with their current licensees or others. These domestic licenses together account for a very significant portion of our Media segment revenues and profitability. No assurances can be provided as to the outcome of these negotiations. See Item 1A – Risk Factors. 
WWE’s TV-PG, family-friendly television programming, including RAW, SmackDown and NXT, can be seen in more than one billion homes and in 25 languages around the world. Our international broadcast partners currently include: BT Sport in the United Kingdom; Sony Ten in India, Rogers in Canada and Foxtel in Australia, among many others. 

Advertising and Sponsorships
WWE utilizes a multitude of platforms, including the Internet and social media, to promote our brands, market and distribute our content and digital products, create a community experience among our fans and sell advertising across these various platforms. WWE currently streams its media content on select social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook. With nearly 93 million subscribers on YouTube, WWE consistently ranks among the top viewed channels, with over 12 billion views of WWE content in 2022. The Company also receives advertising revenues from YouTube and Facebook based on viewership data of our content. In 2022, WWE had over 1.1 billion social media fan engagements across social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Tumblr.
Our primary website, WWE.com, attracted an average of over four million monthly unique visitors worldwide during 2022. These visitors viewed an average of over 40 million pages and five million video streams per month. WWE short-form video and other content is available through our mobile partnerships. WWE currently has local language-based websites allowing fans to experience WWE in their native language with a concentration on local events and shows. We monetize our digital advertising inventory on WWE.com in global markets via programmatic ad sales and relationships with sales agencies.
In addition, through our product integrations, we offer advertisers a wide range of promotional opportunities, including online and print advertising, on-air announcements and special appearances by our Superstars. These opportunities allow our advertisers and sponsors to engage consumers across a variety of our platforms. In 2022, we grew several partnerships with blue-chip brands, including Take-Two Interactive, Xfinity Comcast, C4 Energy, Credit One Bank, and Blue Triton/Pure Life. We also partnered with new advertisers, such as Door Dash, Mike’s Hard Beverage Co., Toyota, Krafton, Hasbro, and Amazon Studios. Our sponsors promote their products utilizing our digital media assets, including promotion on WWE.com as well as promotion through WWE Network and through our live events. Certain sponsorship sales related to WWE Network are shared with NBCU.
Other
Our Media segment also generates revenue from the distribution of other WWE content, including, but not limited to, certain live in-ring programming content in international markets, scripted, reality and other programming.
During 2022, we held two large-scale international events, Elimination Chamber and Crown Jewel, for which we received a fixed fee, as compared to one large-scale international event during 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19.
Our WWE Media team also develops and produces scripted and non-scripted television and digital content. In 2022, we expanded our partnership with A&E with the creation of new documentaries, including WWE Rivals, while also adding additional episodes to the acclaimed Biography: WWE Legends and WWE’s Most Wanted Treasures series. This programming continues to drive viewership gains on Sunday nights for the A&E network. We also created new content in our partnership with Peacock to deliver the series WWE Evil, which chronicles the minds of the most diabolical antagonists in WWE history.
Our current reality-based television series is Miz and Mrs. This docuseries, which premiered in July 2018 on USA Network, chronicles the lives of WWE Superstars The Miz and Maryse. The third season of this series premiered in June 2022.
Live Events
Live Events net revenues were $123.1 million, $57.8 million and $19.9 million, representing 10%, 5% and 2% of total net revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Our broad and talented roster of Superstars allows us to perform in numerous domestic markets and take advantage of the strong international demand for our events. Live events and the associated programming produced at our live events are our principal creative content and production activities. Our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our premium live events which air on WWE Network.
The impact of COVID-19 was significant on our live events segment from March 2020 through the first half of 2021, as revenues are highly dependent on ticket sales at our live events, which were cancelled during this period due to public health concerns. We held our annual WrestleMania events in April 2021 with ticketed audiences at a limited capacity, and in July 2021, we resumed our domestic and international live event touring schedules.
North American Ticket Sales
In 2022, we produced 218 live events (excluding NXT) throughout North America, entertaining over 1.3 million fans at an average ticket price of $73.13. We held many of our premium live events at major stadiums and arenas across the country. In addition to providing 

 

content for our television and other programming, these events provide us with a real-time assessment of the popularity of our storylines and characters.
International Ticket Sales
In 2022, we produced 13 live events (excluding NXT) internationally, reaching nearly 106,000 fans at an average ticket price of $114.66. These events were held primarily in the United Kingdom during our international tour in September 2022, including our premium live event, Clash at the Castle. We also held events in Germany, Switzerland, Mexico and France during 2022.
Consumer Products
Consumer Products net revenues were $134.5 million, $101.2 million and $86.1 million, representing 10%, 9% and 9% of total net revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Consumer Product Licensing
We have established a worldwide licensing program using our marks and logos, copyrighted works and characters on a large variety of products, including video games, toys, apparel, trading cards and other collectibles. Currently, we have relationships with more than 100 licensees worldwide that provide products for sale at major retailers. To maintain the distinctive style and quality of our intellectual property and brand, we retain creative approval over the design, packaging, advertising and promotional materials associated with these products. Additionally, we continually seek new opportunities to partner with best-in-class organizations to develop new products for our fans and further expand our licensing business.
Video games and toys are among the largest components of our licensing program. We have a comprehensive, multi-year licensing agreement with Mattel, Inc., our master toy licensee, covering all global territories, and a multi-year licensing agreement with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") to produce and sell our branded console video games. WWE branded video games currently include WWE 2K, WWE Battlegrounds, and WWE SuperCard. The video game industry continues to migrate the availability of video games toward downloadable content through an Internet connected device. Accordingly, our video games can be downloaded via the Internet and contain subsequent downloadable content that can be purchased to add additional characters and game modes to enhance game play.
We have several exclusive multi-year agreements for trading cards and other collectibles, including the Panini Group and Blockchain Creative Labs. These relationships provide opportunities for WWE to develop new products with our fans and expand our licensing business.
Music is an integral part of the WWE entertainment experience. We compose and record music, including Superstar entrance themes, in our recording studio. In addition to our own composed music, we license music performed by popular artists.
eCommerce
In July 2022, we launched an exclusive, multi-year partnership with Fanatics to create a new, enhanced retail experience for WWE fans globally, and transitioned our digital retail platform to Fanatics. As a result of this partnership, Fanatics became the exclusive provider of certain product categories for e-commerce. Prior to this transition, WWEShop was our direct-to-consumer e-commerce storefront and we also distributed our merchandise on other domestic and international e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, which continues for certain product categories. Under the direct-to-consumer model, we processed nearly 300,000 orders through July 2022 as compared to 586,600 during the full year of 2021.
Venue Merchandise
Our direct-to-consumer venue merchandise business consists of the design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of numerous WWE-branded products such as t-shirts, belts, caps and other novelty items, all of which feature our Superstars and/or logos.
The impact of COVID-19 was significant on our venue merchandise results from March 2020 through the first half of 2021, as revenues are highly dependent on purchases of merchandise by consumers at our live events, which were cancelled during this period due to public health concerns.
Customers
Our customers include content distributors of our media content through their networks and platforms, fans who purchase tickets to our live events or purchase our merchandise at venues or online through our eCommerce partner, subscribers to WWE Network, advertisers, sponsors, and consumer product licensees. As noted elsewhere, we have several important partners, including NBCU and its affiliates who, among other things, carry the domestic television distribution of Raw and NXT, and carry exclusive streaming rights of WWE Network content domestically. We also partner with Fox Network who carries the domestic television distribution of 

 

SmackDown, and the General Entertainment Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who, among other things, hosts our large-scale premium live events in the Middle East. The Company anticipates that during 2023 it will be involved in negotiations to renew or replace our domestic television distribution rights agreements for RAW, SmackDown and NXT with their current licensees or others. No assurances can be provided as to the outcome of these negotiations. See Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Creative Development and Production
Our creative team, which is led by Paul Levesque, the Company’s Chief Content Officer, develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our premium live events. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all our in-ring television programming carries a PG rating, which is critical to maintaining the Company’s reputation for family friendly entertainment.
Our success is due primarily to the continuing popularity of our Superstars. We have nearly 250 Superstars under exclusive contracts, ranging from multi-year guaranteed contracts with established Superstars to developmental contracts with our Superstars in training. Our Superstars are highly trained and motivated independent contractors, whose compensation is tied to the revenue that they help generate. We own the rights to substantially all our characters and exclusively license the rights we do not own through agreements with our Superstars.
Talent Development
We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. Our development system, including the NXT division, features talent training to become WWE Superstars and has produced over 95% of our current active main roster stars, such as Roman Reigns, Bianca Belair, Sami Zayn, Becky Lynch, Austin Theory and Liv Morgan. NXT has evolved into our third brand after Raw and SmackDown and has transitioned into a weekly live television series. More than 30% of our developmental talent come from countries outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, China, India, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Nigeria. Women comprise over 40% of our developmental talent. NXT talent train at our WWE Performance Center in Florida, a state-of-the-art training facility, which was designed to cultivate our next generation of talent and has become the center of our talent development program.
In August 2022, following the success of our live events and talent identification efforts throughout all of Europe, we announced that our NXT brand will grow internationally with the creation of an all-new NXT Europe. The Company plans to launch NXT Europe in 2023.

In December 2021, we launched a major comprehensive recruiting initiative for in-ring competitors called Next In Line (“NIL”).  This program serves to recruit and develop potential future Superstars, and further enhances WWE’s talent development process through collaborative partnerships with select athletes from diverse athletic backgrounds. The program has signed 46 full-time college athletes since its inception and currently has 40 active athletes following the graduation of six inaugural members from the program. In addition to the United States, the class includes representatives from a myriad of countries, including Canada and Nigeria. These athlete partnerships will feature access to the state-of-the-art WWE Performance Center in Orlando, in addition to resources across the organization, including brand building, media training, communications, live event promotion, creative writing and community relations. Upon completion of the NIL program, select athletes may be offered a WWE contract.
Competition
While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live event and media content audiences, we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, and other leisure activities. We continue to face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content as streamed media offerings continue to expand. For purchases of our merchandise, we compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. Many companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do.
Trademarks and Copyrights
Intellectual property is material to all aspects of our operations, and we expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties’ intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights in our television and WWE Network programming, music, photographs, books, films and apparel art. We also own a large number of internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide.

 


We vigorously seek to enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use, seizing counterfeit goods and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results.
Human Capital 
The Company believes it has a talented, motivated, and dedicated team, and is committed to supporting the development of all of its team members and to continuously build its culture. As of February 2023, the Company had approximately 890 full-time equivalent employees, of which approximately 870 are U.S.-based employees. We believe the relationship between WWE and our employees is generally strong. Our in-house production staff is supplemented with contract personnel for our television production who are not included in our headcount. Our employee headcount also excludes our Superstars and NXT talent, who are independent contractors.
Workplace Practices and Policies
The Company is committed to providing a workplace free of harassment and discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status and other legally protected characteristics. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity. In 2022, the Company’s management partnered with a third-party consultant to conduct a comprehensive culture review and recommend human capital initiatives and best practices.
Compensation and Benefits
The Company believes that compensation should not only be equitable, but also competitive enabling employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive and outperform when they are given the resources to meet their needs and the support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits to employees around the world. Workforce compensation, benefits, and professional development are considered a critical investment in the Company’s growth.
Health and Safety
The Company is committed to protecting its employees everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential risks associated with workplace activities in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company has taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including providing information resources, testing, face masks and personal protective equipment, and case support. The Company also offers comprehensive health coverage to its employees.
Regulation 
Live Events
In some United States and international jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction.
Television and WWE Network Programming
The marketplace for audio-visual programming (including cable television and Internet programming) in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. Certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations are imposed directly on the Company and/or indirectly through our distributors. Other domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to video programming are announced from time to time. In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance. One of our weekly television programs, SmackDown, is distributed via broadcast television on the Fox Network, and as a result we are responsible, directly or indirectly, for compliance with certain additional FCC regulations and statutory requirements.
