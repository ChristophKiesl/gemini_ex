ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of and owned approximately 92% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2022.
We currently own all or portions of: 
New York:
•62 Manhattan operating properties consisting of: 
•19.9 million square feet of office space in 30 of the properties; 
•2.6 million square feet of street retail space in 56 of the properties; 
•1,664 units in six residential properties;
•Multiple development sites, including 350 Park Avenue and the Hotel Pennsylvania site;
•A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns six properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.1 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building, and The Alexander, a 312-unit apartment tower in Queens;
•Signage throughout the Penn District and Times Square; and
•Building Maintenance Services LLC ("BMS"), a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning and security services for our buildings and third parties.
Other Real Estate and Investments:
•The 3.7 million square foot theMART in Chicago;
•A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating 1.8 million square feet; and
•Other real estate and investments.
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:
•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;
•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;
•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;
•developing and redeveloping properties to increase returns and maximize value; and
•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.
We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds and proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
PENN District
The Farley Building
Our 95% joint venture (5% is owned by the Related Companies ("Related")) is completing the development of The Farley Building, which includes approximately 846,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 116,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space. The total development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $1,120,000,000 at our 95% share, of which $1,111,493,000 of cash has been expended as of December 31, 2022.
PENN 1
We are redeveloping PENN 1, a 2,546,000 square foot office building located on 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the “MTA”) to oversee the redevelopment of the Long Island Rail Road Concourse at Penn Station (the "Concourse"). Skanska USA Civil Northeast, Inc. is performing the redevelopment under a fixed price contract for $396,000,000 which is being funded by the MTA. In connection with the redevelopment, we entered into an agreement with the MTA which will result in the widening of the Concourse to relieve overcrowding and our trading of 15,000 square feet of back of house space for 22,000 square feet of retail frontage space. Vornado's total development cost of our PENN 1 project is estimated to be $450,000,000, of which $375,810,000 of cash has been expended as of December 31, 2022.
PENN 2
We are redeveloping PENN 2, a 1,795,000 square foot (as expanded) office building, located on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $750,000,000, of which $393,126,000 of cash has been expended as of December 31, 2022.
Hotel Pennsylvania Site
We have permanently closed the Hotel Pennsylvania and plan to develop an office tower on the site. Demolition of the existing building structure commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We are also making districtwide improvements within the PENN District. The development cost of these improvements is estimated to be $100,000,000, of which $41,776,000 of cash has been expended as of December 31, 2022. 
We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the PENN District and 350 Park Avenue.
There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget.
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES
We have long believed a focus on environmental sustainability is responsible management of our business and important to our tenants, investors, employees and communities that we serve. It has been central to Vornado's business strategy for over 10 years. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Vornado's Board of Trustees is assigned with oversight of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters, which includes climate change risk. Environmental sustainability initiatives are carried out by a dedicated team of professionals that work directly with our business units.
Vornado is an industry leader in sustainability, owning and operating more than 27 million square feet of LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings, representing 95% of our office portfolio, with over 23 million square feet at LEED Gold or Platinum. In 2022, we (i) were selected as a global “Sector Leader” for Diversified Office/Retail REITs in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark ("GRESB"), ranking first in the United States amongst peers and ranking third among 112 responding listed companies within the Americas, and received the “Green Star” distinction for the tenth consecutive year and GRESB's five star rating, (ii) received the Leader in the Light Award by the National Association for Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) for diversified REITs for the twelfth time, and (iii) were recognized as an EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year with the distinction of having demonstrated seven years of sustained excellence.
We prioritize addressing climate change and in 2019 adopted a 10-year plan to make our buildings carbon neutral by 2030 (“Vision 2030”). Vision 2030 is a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes energy efficiency, demand management, and renewable power. We rely on technology, as well as meaningful stakeholder collaboration with our tenants, our employees, and our communities, to achieve this plan. Our commitment to carbon neutrality and associated emissions reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative as consistent with a 1.5°C climate scenario, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.
We consider sustainability in all aspects of our business, including the design, construction, retrofitting and ongoing maintenance and operations of our portfolio of buildings. We operate our buildings sustainably and efficiently by seeking to establish best practices in energy and water consumption, carbon reduction, resource and waste management and ecologically sensitive procurement. Our policies, from 100% green cleaning to energy efficiency, are implemented across our entire portfolio. We undertake significant outreach with our tenants, employees and investors regarding Vornado’s sustainability programs and strategies.
Our 2022 and 2023 long-term performance plan awards formally tie senior management compensation to achievement of certain ESG targets, including reductions in greenhouse emissions, achieving a specified GRESB score and targeting a specified percentage of LEED Gold or Platinum certified square footage in our office portfolio.
We are committed to transparent reporting of sustainability performance indicators and publish an annual ESG Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative and aligned with the metrics codified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and recommendations set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We also submit public reports to CDP (formerly, the Carbon Disclosure Project), CSA (the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment) and EP100 (global initiative led by Climate Group). Further details on our environmental sustainability initiatives and strategy, including our Vision 2030 Roadmap, can be found in our 2021 ESG Report at (esg.vno.com). There can be no assurance that our Vision 2030 commitment will be achieved in the planned time frame. The ESG Report is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 3,146 employees, consisting of (i) 2,622 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security, engineering and parking services primarily to our New York properties, (ii) 236 employees in our corporate office, (iii) 158 employees in leasing and property management, and (iv) 130 employees of theMART. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities.

Compensation, Benefits and Employees Wellbeing
To attract and retain the best-qualified talent and to help our employees stay healthy, balance their work and personal lives, and meet their financial and retirement goals, we offer competitive benefits including, but not limited to, market-competitive compensation, healthcare (medical, dental and vision coverage), a health savings account, 401(k) and employer match, dependent care flexible spending account, parental leave, adoption/surrogacy benefits, short-term and long-term disability insurance, life insurance, time off/paid holidays, tuition reimbursement, subsidized gym memberships, employee wellness programs and incentives, in-workplace COVID-19 and flu vaccinations, commuter benefits, an employee assistance program and workplace flexibility.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - CONTINUED
Talent Development
We promote career and personal development, provide training and continuing education, and encourage innovation and engagement. This includes tuition reimbursement for our employees’ continuing education and professional development, and the opportunity to participate in a variety of training and networking engagements.
Culture and Engagement
Our employees are critical to our success, and we believe creating a positive and inclusive culture is essential to attracting and retaining engaged employees. We seek to retain our employees by actively engaging with our workforce and we solicit their feedback through our divisional leaders and employee surveys. We use their feedback to create and continually enhance programs that support their needs.
Through our volunteer program, Vornado Volunteers, employees are granted one day of paid time off per calendar year to volunteer for a cause of their choice.
Diversity and Inclusion
Vornado is a diverse and inclusive environment that empowers the individual and enriches the employment experience. We have published Equal Employment Opportunity “EEO” data since 2017 and have a broadly diverse workforce across both our corporate base as well as our BMS division. Our employee demographics data can be found on our ESG micro-site (esg.vno.com), which is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our diversity metrics set a baseline from where we constantly strive to improve.
Health and Wellness 
As a building owner and landlord to thousands of business tenants, we focus on maintaining and improving the health of our indoor environments, as well as communicating the value of our health and wellness programs with consistency and clarity to our stakeholders. We believe that consistent health programming and communications protocols not only mitigate health risks within our buildings, but they also create a responsible behavior framework for our employees, our tenants, and our visitors.
Labor Relations
BMS employs and manages janitorial and security staff who are members of 32BJ SEIU and engineering staff who are members of Local 94 of the International Union of Operating Engineers AFL-CIO. Through our active participation in the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, we work collaboratively with both unions and consider our relations with our union employees to be very positive.

COMPETITION
We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of whom may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.
SEGMENT DATA
We operate in the following reportable segments: New York and Other. Financial information related to these reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is set forth in Note 23 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES 
None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES
We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold or otherwise disposed of when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. Generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by Vornado’s Board of Trustees without the vote of our shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders.
