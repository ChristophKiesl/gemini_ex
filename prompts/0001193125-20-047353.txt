Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

THE COMPANY 
 We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, credit research, asset management, portfolio management, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting functions. We primarily invest in single-tenant real estate assets throughout the U.S., which are generally acquired through sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to high quality tenants with business operations within retail, industrial, office and other industries. 
 We began operations through a predecessor legal entity in 2003. On September 25, 2012, we completed our initial public offering and on July 17, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Cole Credit Property Trust II, Inc. The surviving entity, which was renamed Spirit Realty Capital, Inc., began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “SRC.” 
 On May 31, 2018, we completed a Spin-Off of all our interests in the assets that collateralized Master Trust 2014, our properties leased to Shopko, and certain other assets into an independent, publicly traded REIT, SMTA. In conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into the Asset Management Agreement with SMTA, pursuant to which the Company acted as external asset manager for SMTA for an annual management fee of $20.0 million. In September 2019, SMTA sold the assets held in Master Trust 2014 and approved a plan of liquidation. The Asset Management Agreement was terminated, and the Interim Management Agreement with SMTA became effective. Pursuant to the Interim Management Agreement, we are entitled to receive $1 million during the initial one-year term and $4 million for any renewal one-year term, plus certain cost reimbursements, to manage and liquidate the remaining SMTA assets.

    As of December 31, 2019, Spirit owned of 1,752 properties with gross investment in real estate and loans totaling approximately $6.17 billion. Of this amount, $6.14 billion consisted of our gross investment in real estate, representing ownership of 1,752 properties, with in-place annualized Contractual Rent of $461.0 million. The remaining $33.7 million consisted primarily of commercial mortgage loans receivable secured by 43 real properties. See Item 2. “Properties - Our Real Estate Investment Portfolio” for further information on our properties and tenants. 

Our operations are carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns approximately 1% of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners and together own the remaining 99% of the Operating Partnership. 
 Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for assets owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests of the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued. 
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 85 employees, as compared to 89 employees as of December 31, 2018. None of these employees are represented by a labor union. 
 BUSINESS AND GROWTH STRATEGIES 
 Our objective is to maximize stockholder value by providing a growing stream of earnings and dividends generated by high quality, diversified commercial real estate. We seek to accomplish this objective by utilizing our proprietary tools and underwriting expertise to invest in and manage a portfolio of single tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the U.S. with tenants we believe possess attractive credit characteristics and operate in stable or growing industries. We generate revenue primarily by leasing our properties to our tenants under a triple-net lease; however, in support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have, and will, strategically originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans, construction financing and other loans. See Item 2. “Properties” for property information and Item 6. “Selected Financial Data” for additional financial and asset information. 
 Single-tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities essential to the generation of their sales and profits. Under a triple-net lease, the tenant is typically responsible for all improvements and is contractually obligated to pay all property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs. 
 Enhanced Portfolio Management Using Proprietary Tools 
 We selectively make acquisitions that we believe will contribute to our business objectives. We believe there will be ample acquisition opportunities in the single-tenant market fitting our underwriting and acquisition criteria. In order to minimize risk and maximize returns for our stockholders, Spirit has developed several propriety tools that inform our portfolio management decisions. 

o | Spirit Property Ranking Model. The Spirit Property Ranking Model is a core tool developed internally by Spirit that ranks every owned and acquired property across twelve criteria, with a higher weighting allocated to real estate characteristics. The criteria include: (i) replacement rent, assuming the property becomes vacant, (ii) real estate score based on the site’s location, access, visibility and overall desirability, (iii) 5-mile population, (iv) remaining lease term, (v) 5-mile house-hold income,(vi) pre-overhead unit coverage, (vii) pre-overhead master lease coverage, (viii) corporate coverage, (ix) U.S. State ranking, (x) rent escalation characteristics, (xi) lease structure and (xii) tenant industry ranking. We believe that the higher the overall score assigned to a property, the lower the risk of a residual loss given a tenant default. Through acquisitions, dispositions, lease renewals and re-lets, we seek to continually improve the weighted-average property ranking of our portfolio.

o | The Spirit Heat Map. The Spirit Heat Map is used to analyze tenant industries across Porter’s Five Forces and for potential causes of technological disruption. The data is then used to predict the long-term future performance of those industries. The Spirit Heat Map is updated regularly to incorporate changes in business and market conditions, changes in technology and other trends. Using this tool, coupled with our intensive credit and real estate analysis, lease structuring and ongoing portfolio management, we seek to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by focusing our investments within industries that we believe will be healthy and viable prospectively and disposing of properties within industries that have less favorable outlooks.

o | Spirit Business Intelligence Tools. Our business intelligence tools capture and bring together critical information across Spirit’s databases, including Property Ranking data, industry data and tenant credit data, allowing the information to be efficiently analyzed. Spirit uses these tools to compare potential acquisitions and dispositions to the existing portfolio and quantify improvements in key metrics including industry concentration, tenant concentration, weighted-average lease term, weighted-average Spirit Property Ranking and credit metrics.

   Credit Underwriting 
 We believe extensive credit underwriting is important to minimizing tenant financial risk and protecting stockholder value. Our Credit department, which is independent from our Acquisitions department, underwrites all acquisition, disposition and capital investment opportunities, as well as monitors the financial health of our existing portfolio. We use our underwriting capabilities to identify tenants with attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories and to dispose of tenants with weakening characteristics. 
 As part of our acquisition strategy, we target tenants that are publicly listed, as we believe those tenants possess certain attractive characteristics, including continual access to capital, generally lower leverage, audited financial statements and governance scrutiny. Our portfolio is well diversified between investment and non-investment grade rated tenants with approximately 50% of our properties leased to public issuers. 
 Portfolio Diversification 
 We believe that portfolio diversification is a cornerstone to managing the inherent risk associated with investing in real estate. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” Our strategy emphasizes a portfolio that (i) derives no more than 5.0% of its annual rent from any single tenant and no more than 2.0% of its annual rent from any single property, (ii) is leased to tenants operating in various industries aligned with our Spirit Heat Map and (iii) is located across the U.S. without significant geographic concentration. As of December 31, 2019, our largest single tenant exposure equaled 2.9%, our largest geographic concentration equaled 11.3% and our largest industry concentration equaled 8.6% of Contractual Rent, while no single property rent exceeded 2.0%. While we consider the foregoing when making investments, we have made, and may make investments in the future that do not meet one or more of these criteria, and we may make additional investments that do not meet one or more of these criteria if we believe the opportunity is sufficiently attractive. Since our inception, our Occupancy has never fallen below 96.1%, despite the economic downturn of 2008 through 2010. 
Execute Leases with Optimal Structures 
 We seek to maintain the stability of our rental revenue and the long-term return on our investments by entering into leases with structures we deem to be aligned with our business and growth strategies: 

o | Leases for Operationally Essential Real Estate. We seek to own properties that are operationally essential to our tenants, thereby reducing the risk that the tenant would choose not to renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Enhance Our Portfolio through Contractual Rental Growth. Approximately 88.8% of our owned properties (based on Contractual Rent) contain contractual provisions that increase the rental revenue over the term of the lease. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent at specified dates by: (i) a fixed amount; or (ii) the lesser of (a) 1 to 2 times any increase in the CPI over a specified period, (b) a fixed percentage, or (c) a fixed schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leases with Relatively Long Terms. We seek to enter into leases with relatively long terms, typically with non-cancellable initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Leases with a Master Lease Structure. Where appropriate, we seek to enter into master leases whereby we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an “all or none” basis. In a master lease structure, a tenant is responsible for a single lease payment relating to the entire portfolio of leased properties, as opposed to separate lease payments relating to each individually leased property. The master lease structure hinders a tenant’s ability to “cherry pick” locations, where it unilaterally gives up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINANCING STRATEGY 
 Our long-term financing strategy is to maintain a leverage profile that creates operational flexibility and generates superior risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We finance our operations and investments using a variety of methods, including available unrestricted cash balances, property operating revenue, proceeds from property dispositions, available borrowings under our credit facilities, common and preferred stock issuances, and debt securities issuances, including mortgage indebtedness and senior unsecured debt. We determine the amount of equity and debt financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating our cost of equity capital, terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity) and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. 
 We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows the offering proceeds to be accretively invested into additional properties, to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facilities, or to repay outstanding debt at or before maturity. 
 In September 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became immediately effective upon filing and will remain effective for a term of three years with an expiration in September 2020. Under this shelf registration statement, 

 9

   we may offer shares of our common or preferred stock or debt securities from time to time in amounts, at prices and on terms to be announced when and if such shares are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds from any such offerings, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of such offerings. 
 We have issued senior unsecured debt securities and have obtained other senior unsecured debt at the Operating Partnership level. In addition, our debt historically has also consisted of long-term borrowings secured by specific real estate assets or, more typically, pools of real estate assets. To the extent practicable, we expect to maintain a well-balanced debt profile with manageable and balanced maturities. 
 We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our available credit facilities and periodically through issuances of public securities. 
 We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations going forward; however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital and credit markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us. 
 REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES 
 Concentration 
 During the month ended December 31, 2019, no tenant exceeded 5.0% of our Contractual Rent, and no one single property contributed more than 2.0% of our Contractual Rent. See Item 2. “Properties - Our Real Estate Investment Portfolio” for further information on our ten largest tenants and the composition of our tenant base. 
Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased 334 properties, representing an aggregate gross investment of $1.29 billion, and invested $45.0 million in revenue producing capital expenditures to fund improvements on properties the Company already owned. During the same period, we sold 44 properties with an undepreciated gross investment of $239.2 million. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our investments. 
COMPETITION 
 We face competition for acquisitions from investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity funds and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment. 
 As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates and flexibility. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, have lower cost of capital, have access to more resources and have greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire. 
 REGULATION 
 General 
 Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals. 
Americans With Disabilities Act 
 Pursuant to the ADA, our properties are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA, as well as a number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations, may require modifications to properties we currently own and any properties we purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation 

 10

   could impose additional financial obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repair costs pursuant to triple-net leases, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with such laws or regulations. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial and can exceed the value of the property. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
 Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties are or were used for commercial or industrial purposes that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, and we could potentially be required to pay to clean up any contamination. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations. As a result of the foregoing, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of ACM. Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. As a result of these regulations, building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to ACM. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing ACM in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. 
 When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties that have not been previously addressed or remediated by us. 
 Before completing any property acquisition, we obtain environmental assessments in order to identify potential environmental concerns at the property. These assessments are carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments (ASTM Practice E 1527-05) as set by ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope, however, if recommended in the initial assessments, we may 

 11

    undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater samplings or other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys to test for substances of concern. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. If environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environment insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant (i.e., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability to honor its indemnification obligations to us). 
 Generally, our leases provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property. However, our ultimate liability for environmental conditions may exceed the policy limits on any environmental insurance policies we obtain, if any. If we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees or if the amount of environmental insurance we carry is inadequate, our results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 INSURANCE 
 Our tenants are generally required to maintain liability and property insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to triple-net leases. Under such leases, our tenants are generally required to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and additional insured and/or loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Tenants are required to maintain casualty coverage and most carry limits at 100% of replacement cost. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind/hail, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Properties - Insurance on our properties may not adequately cover all losses, which could materially and adversely affect us.”
 In addition to being generally named as additional insureds on our tenants’ liability policies, we separately maintain commercial general liability coverage with limits of $1.0 million for each occurrence and $2.0 million general aggregate and excess liability coverage with limits of $50.0 million. We also maintain primary property coverage on (i) all unleased properties, (ii) all properties for which such coverage is not required to be carried by a tenant and (iii) all properties for which we obtain such coverage but the costs of which are reimbursed by tenants. In addition, we maintain excess property coverage on all remaining properties and other property coverage as may be required by our lenders.
