ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Legacy Education Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on November 23, 2010 in Nevada under the name Streamline Resources, Inc. Our name was subsequently changed to Priced In Corp (“PRCD”) on April 24, 2012. Prior to the merger discussed below, we were a shell corporation with nominal operating activity. 
 
On November 10, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of such date the (“Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) PRCD, a Nevada corporation, (ii) Priced In Corp. Subsidiary, a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PRCD (“PRCD Sub”), (iii) Tigrent Inc., a Colorado corporation (“TIGE”), and (iv) Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc., a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIGE (“Legacy Holdings”). On November 10, 2014, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, PRCD Sub merged with and into Legacy Holdings (the “Merger”), with Legacy Holdings surviving the Merger and becoming our wholly owned subsidiary and we acquired the business of Legacy Holdings.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”):
 

● | PRCD amended and restated its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which included an increase in our authorized stock to 220 million shares (200 million shares of common stock and 20 million shares of preferred stock); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PRCD changed its name from “Priced In Corp.” to “Legacy Education Alliance, Inc.”; 
● | All of the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Legacy Holdings outstanding at the Effective Time were converted and exchanged into 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and were held by TIGE. 

 
As a result of the Merger, TIGE owned approximately 80% of Legacy with the then remaining outstanding shares (3,997,500) held by the existing PRCD shareholders.
 
There was no cash consideration exchanged in the Merger. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, PRCD agreed to pay TIGE taxes and related liabilities and other specified costs and expenses, including certain administrative and related expenses that have been or will be from time to time incurred by TIGE that are related to TIGE’s investment in PRCD (including the cost of preparing and distributing reports regarding our business and financial condition to its shareholders), its administrative costs and expenses, and taxes, other than income taxes arising from dividends or distributions by us to TIGE. All shares of PRCD common stock issued in connection with the Merger are restricted securities, as defined in paragraph (a) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”). Such shares were issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated there under.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a “reverse merger” and recapitalization since, immediately following the completion of the transaction, the holders of TIGE’s stock had effective control of PRCD. In addition, TIGE controlled the surviving entity through control of Legacy’s Board of Directors as a result of the appointment of the existing directors of TIGE to the four board seats of Legacy. Additionally, all of TIGE’s officers and senior executive positions continued on as management of the surviving entity after consummation of the Merger. For accounting purposes, Legacy Holdings was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of PRCD. Accordingly, Legacy Holdings’ assets, liabilities and results of operations became the historical financial statements of the registrant, and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with PRCD effective as of the date of the closing of the Merger. Prior to the Merger, PRCD was a “shell” corporation with nominal assets, liabilities and operating activity. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.

Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to be the leading global provider of services and products that enable individuals from all walks of life, regardless of their current economic situation and education background, to take control of their financial futures and enable them to achieve financial freedom.
 
Our strategy is focused primarily on the following areas:
 

● | Continued development of our U.S. businesses. We will continue our focus on U.S. service offerings in an attempt to improve our revenue and expand our offerings as appropriate, including e-learning and other electronic format offerings and the development of new brands. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development of our International market. We continue to expand internationally. Starting in 2014, we expanded our footprint to include Africa, Europe, and Asia, holding events in 21 countries. As we established traction in these markets, we opened offices in South Africa and Hong Kong during the first six months of 2015. Overall, we added an additional five new countries to our footprint in 2015 for a total global reach of 26 countries. In 2016 we held more events in several of these countries than in the prior years. We intend to continue to focus on diversifying our sales internationally. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security and longevity of our brands. We operate under 10 different brands. This provides us the flexibility to provide our services through different demographics, price points and sales channels. This strategy of going to market with multiple brands allows us to protect the individual brands and to provide brand diversification if a particular brand enters a difficult phase. This strategy also allows us to manage individual brand-fatigue while maintaining overall market share and meeting competition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fulfilling our customer obligations. We intend to optimize the pace and improve the cost efficiency with which we fulfill our long term customer commitments. We have: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanded the options for course fulfillment in order to reduce the number of expired contracts; by increasing the number of courses offered through electronic media and via the internet; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | implemented an improved outreach program that involves contacting our customers to help them manage their course schedules; 


2
-


● | Increased the number of symposiums we hold globally, which we believe will play a significant role in our business model going forward. Symposiums allow us to hold multiple Elite classes in one location resulting in cost savings based on economies of scale. These events have been well received by our customers, providing them with networking opportunities as well as bonus events and activities that have enhanced their experience. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced eLearning. We intend to continue developing and promoting interactive and online distributed course content and enhanced technology platforms capable of streaming video, interactive e-learning, and distributed e-learning. We have been developing our social and brand presence internationally globally. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consistent quality assurance. We believe that to be an effective provider of training we need to ensure that our course offerings meet our strict quality assurance guidelines. We will continue to monitor and enforce standards for marketing, sales presentations, and training delivery throughout our organization. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued professional development. We will continue to identify, recruit and retain a team of trainers, mentors and coaches who possess practical, hands-on experience in their areas of expertise.

Recent Developments
 
On February 14, 2017, TIGE completed the distribution of 15,998,326 shares of Common Stock in Legacy approved by the Board of Directors of TIGE on October 4, 2016. Pursuant to the distribution, 1.00105 shares of Legacy Common Stock were distributed for each share of stock held in TIGE.
 
On February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the adoption of a Rights Agreement between the Company and VStock Transfer, LLC, as Rights Agent (as amended from time to time, the “Rights Agreement”). The Company entered into the Rights Agreement on February 16, 2017. Refer to Form 8-K dated February 17, 2017 for additional information. 
 
Business Overview
  
We are a provider of practical, high-quality, and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate and financial markets investing strategies and techniques. Our programs are offered through a variety of formats and channels, including free-preview workshops, basic training classes, symposiums, telephone mentoring, one-on-one mentoring, coaching and e-learning, primarily under the Rich Dad® Education brand (“Rich Dad”) which was created in 2006 under license from entities affiliated with Robert Kiyosaki, whose teachings and philosophies are detailed in the book titled, Rich Dad Poor Dad. In addition to Rich Dad, we market our products and services under a variety of brands, including Martin Roberts, The Independent Woman, Women in Wealth, Brick Buy Brick and Elite Business Star. Our products and services are offered in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Other Foreign Markets.
 
Our students pay for their courses in full up-front or through payment agreements with independent third parties. Under United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we recognize revenue when our students take their courses or the term for taking their course expires, which could be several quarters after the student purchases a program and pays the fee. Over time, we have taken steps to shorten many of our course contracts from two-year contracts to one-year contracts, which is expected to accelerate revenue recognition as services are delivered faster and/or contract terms expire sooner. We also continue to expand our innovative symposium-style course delivery model into other markets. Our symposiums combine multiple advanced training courses in one location, allowing us to achieve certain economies of scale that reduce costs and improve margins while also accelerating U.S. GAAP revenue recognition, while at the same time, enhancing our student's experience, particularly, for example, through the opportunity to network with other students.
 
We also provide a richer experience for our students through one-on-one mentoring (two to four days in length, on site or remotely) and telephone mentoring (10 to 16 weekly one-on-one or one-on-many telephone sessions). Mentoring involves a subject matter expert interacting with the student remotely or in person and guiding the student, for example, through his or her first real estate transaction, providing a real hands-on experience.
 
We manage our business in four segments based on geographic location. These segments include our historical core markets of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with the fourth segment including all Other Foreign Markets. We continue to expand internationally. Starting in 2014, we expanded our footprint to include Africa, Europe, and Asia, holding events in 21 countries. As we established traction in these markets, we opened offices in South Africa and Hong Kong during the first six months of 2015. Overall, we added an additional five new countries to our footprint in 2015 for a total global reach of 26 countries. In 2016 we held more events in several of these countries than in the prior years. We intend to continue to focus on diversifying our sales internationally.

Marketing
 
Our Rich Dad brands, along with our other brands, are the foundation for our marketing efforts. These brands provide credibility and sustainability within our media mix to promote live events and online trainings. Live onsite two-hour preview events are offered weekly in four to six markets in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Marketing these events is primarily done online through banner ads, text ads, and emails. Direct mail, radio, television, public relations, social media and print advertising are also used to obtain event registrations. We enter into marketing and other agreements with other organizations to market our products and services to the public internationally.
 
We offer people the opportunity to attend a free preview event or they can advance directly to one of our three-day basic training classes. People who enroll and attend the basic training class receive reference materials relevant to the subject matter to be taught at the class. The basic training course is usually held over a weekend within two to four weeks of the initial free preview workshop. Our experience is that offering the free preview as a first step, is an effective way to introduce to our students the methodology of investing, as well as to market and sell our three-day basic training courses.
 
Marketing efforts continue to those customers who choose to continue their education with a three-day basic training class. Welcome letters, product kits that include manuals, books and audio files, an online reference library, and reminder communication letters are all branded for consistency and credibility. Customers at the three-day basic training may choose to continue on with their education through our elite training classes and mentorships offered during the basic training classes.
 
Elite training classes are fulfilled through various delivery methods to meet the needs of our customers. We have re-branded our Elite division from Rich Dad Education to Elite Legacy Education to expand our market reach. As a result of these re-branding efforts, we utilize multiple front end brands to market into our Elite division but Rich Dad will remain the primary marketing channel for attracting customers to our Elite courses in the U.S.
 
We also market for new customers who prefer to learn online and provide people the opportunity to attend free ninety-minute live online webinars that are held weekly on six different topics. Webinars are marketed via online banner ads, affiliate marketing, email campaigns, social media and other media methods. Customers can also skip the entry-leveled free webinars to attend paid online trainings that utilize similar marketing methods to attract attendees.
 
Training Programs
 
We have three significant categories for our programs:
 

● | Basic training live and online courses, 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | Elite level live and online training courses, and 
● | Individualized mentoring programs.

Individualized Mentoring and Coaching Programs
 
We offer live, real time, one-on-one mentoring for Real Estate, Business and the Financial Markets that are tailored to meet students’ individual goals and needs. Real Estate mentoring is offered on site at the student’s chosen location, while Financial Market mentoring can be provided either on-site or remotely. Mentoring is intended to give the student a professional assessment of his or her individual goals and experience and to help the student build an investment plan that can be put into action. Mentoring sessions are generally 2 to 4 days in length.
 
Coaching programs are typically sold in a number of different subject areas and generally delivered in 10 to 16 weekly one-on-one telephone sessions. Some of the topics include Real Estate Coaching, Financial Markets Coaching and Business Coaching. A set curriculum approach is generally used. Each module comes with assignments, exercises and reading materials to be completed between sessions.
 
Geographic Diversification
 
We manage our business in four segments based on geographic location. These segments include our historical core markets of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with the fourth segment including all Other Foreign Markets. We continue to expand internationally, starting in 2014, we expanded our footprint to include Africa, Europe, and Asia, holding events in 21 countries. As we established traction in these markets, we opened offices in South Africa and Hong Kong during the first six months of 2015. Overall, we added an additional five new countries to our footprint in 2015 for a total global reach of 26 countries. In 2016 we held more events in several of these countries than in the prior years. We intend to continue to focus on diversifying our sales internationally.
Competition
 
During our more than 20-year history, we have competed with a number of organizations within the U.S. and internationally. Our primary competitors are Fortune Builders, Armando Montelongo, Zurixx, Dean Graziosi, Flip Advantage, Flipping Formula, Winning the Property War, Yancey Co, Nick Virtucci and Success Resources. Some of these competitors have established brands through a media-based relationship, such as HGTV, and use television programs to promote their brands. We believe that Success Resources is our only significant global competitor in the large event business.
 
Generally, competitive factors within the proprietary training market include:
 

● | The range and depth of course offerings; 
--+---------------------------------------------


● | The quality of trainers; 
--+-----------------------------


● | The quality of reference materials provided in connection with course studies; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost.
--+------

 
We believe that the range and depth of our course offerings, the quality of our trainers and reference materials are comparable or superior to those of our competitors. Typically, our trainers for our Elite courses have been active investors in their chosen field, have been trained by us and, to a large degree, are previous customers of our programs. Trainers for our Elite courses are chosen based on their knowledge and experience with the coursework covered, and are further qualified by meeting knowledge standards developed internally.

Licensing Agreements with the Rich Dad Parties
 
Our primary business relies on our license of the Rich Dad brand and related marks and intellectual property. The following transactions summarize our license to use the Rich Dad trademarks, trade names and other business information worldwide (the “Rich Dad Intellectual Property Rights”):
 
Effective September 1, 2013, we entered into new licensing and related agreements with RDOC (collectively, the “2013 License Agreement”) that replaced the 2010 Rich Dad License Agreement. The initial term of the 2013 License Agreement expires August 31, 2018, but continues thereafter on a yearly basis unless one of the parties provides timely notice of termination. The 2013 License Agreement broadened the field of use to include real estate investing, business strategies, stock market investment techniques, stock/paper assets, cash management, asset protection, entrepreneurship and other financially-oriented subjects. The 2013 License Agreement also (i) reduces the royalty rate payable to RDOC compared to the 2010 Rich Dad License Agreement; (ii) broadens the Company’s exclusivity rights to include education seminars delivered in any medium; (iii) eliminates the cash collateral requirements and related financial covenants contained in the 2010 Rich Dad License Agreement; (iv) continues our right to pay royalties via a promissory note that is convertible to preferred shares upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2013 License Agreement); (v) eliminated approximately $1.6 million in debt from our consolidated balance sheet as a result of debt forgiveness provided for in the agreement terminating the 2010 Rich Dad License Agreement; and (vi) converted another approximately $4.6 million in debt to 1,549,882 shares of our common stock.
 
On April 22, 2014, we entered into an agreement with RDOC to settle certain claims we had against RDOC, Robert Kiyosaki, and Darren Weeks arising out of RDOC’s, Kiyosaki’s, and Weeks’s promotion of a series of live seminars and related products known as Rich Dad:GEO that we alleged infringed on our exclusive rights under the 2013 License Agreement between the Company and RDOC (the “GEO Settlement Agreement”). In the GEO Settlement Agreement, RDOC, Kiyosaki, and Weeks agreed to terminate any further activity in furtherance of the Rich Dad:GEO program. In addition, RDOC agreed, among other things, to (i) amend the 2013 License Agreement to halve the royalty payable by us to RDOC to 2.5% for the whole of 2014, (ii) cancelled approximately $1.3 million in debt owed by us to RDOC, and (iii) reimburse us for the legal fees we incurred in the matter. In addition, RDOC’s right to appoint one member of our Board of Directors previously continued under the 2013 License Agreement was cancelled.
 
The 2013 License Agreement and the GEO Settlement Agreement were assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, Legacy Education Alliance Holdings, Inc. on September 10, 2014.
 
License Agreement with Robbie Fowler
 
We entered into a Talent Endorsement Agreement with an effective date of January 1, 2013 with Robbie Fowler that supplements an earlier November 2, 2012 Agreement with Mr. Fowler (collectively, the “Fowler License Agreement”). The Fowler License Agreement grants us the exclusive right to use Robbie Fowler’s name, image, and likeness in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale in the United Kingdom of a property training course developed by us. The agreement expired on January 1, 2015, and has subsequently been extended upon mutual consent of the parties. The agreement is terminable at will by either party. Under the Fowler License Agreement, we pay Mr. Fowler a royalty on revenues realized from the sale of Robbie Fowler-branded property courses and affiliated products, after deductions for value added taxes, returns and refunds.
License Agreement with Martin Roberts
 
In 2009, we entered into a Talent Endorsement Agreement with Martin Roberts that grants us the exclusive right to use Martin Robert’s, name, image, and likeness, as well as well as the rights to use the name of Mr. Roberts’s published book entitled “Making Money From Property,” in connection with the advertisement, promotion, and sale in the United Kingdom of a property training course developed by us. The term of the license will continue unless (i) terminated by one party upon the event of a default of the party, or (ii) by either party without cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party. Under the License Agreement with Mr. Roberts, we pay Mr. Roberts a royalty on revenues realized from the sale of Robbie Fowler-branded property courses and affiliated products that are collected within thirty (30) days after a Company-sponsored Martin Roberts-branded event, after deductions for value added taxes, banking charges, returns, refunds, and third party commissions. For sales to clients introduced to us directly by Mr. Roberts and his associated websites as well as other marketing and promotional activities Mr. Roberts or his associated companies may wish to undertake from time to time that are not part of a Company sponsored event and which result in the sale of ours basic training her marketing and promotional activities, Mr. Roberts is entitled to 50% of gross revenue from such sales of directly introduced clients. 
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of December 31, 2016 we had approximately 203 full-time employees of whom 157, or 77%, were located in the U.S. and the remaining 23% were located in the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa or Hong Kong. In addition, we employ part-time employees in various capacities and independent contractors who are trainers, coaches or mentors. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Our independent contractors are either paid commissions based upon the dollar value of the courses purchased by customers at our free preview workshops and basic training courses, or are paid fixed fees for teaching and mentoring Elite courses. Independent contractors are required to execute agreements with us that set forth their commission structures and contain customary confidentiality and non-competition provisions.
