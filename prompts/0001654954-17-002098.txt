ITEM 1—BUSINESS
 
 Tenax Therapeutics was originally formed as a New Jersey corporation in 1967 under the name Rudmer, David & Associates, Inc., and subsequently changed its name to Synthetic Blood International, Inc. Effective June 30, 2008, we changed the domiciliary state of the corporation to Delaware and changed the company name to Oxygen Biotherapeutics, Inc. On September 19, 2014, we changed the company name to Tenax Therapeutics, Inc.
 
 Tenax Therapeutics, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing products for the critical care market. On November 13, 2013, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Life Newco, Inc., or Life Newco, we acquired a license granting Life Newco an exclusive, sublicenseable right in the United States and Canada to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing levosimendan, 2.5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion / 5ml vial, for use in the reduction of morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery patients at risk for developing Low Cardiac Output Syndrome, or LCOS.
 
 We were previously developing Oxycyte®, a systemic perfluorocarbon, or PFC, product we believed to be a safe and effective oxygen carrier for use in situations of acute ischemia. In addition, we previously developed a family of perfluorocarbon-based oxygen carriers for use in personal care, topical wound healing, and other topical indications. During 2014, we suspended the development of these PFC products while we evaluate strategic alternatives for future development and commercialization of these product candidates.
 

 In 2015, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year to a fiscal year beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year, such change beginning as of January 1, 2016. Accordingly, this annual report on Form 10-K includes financial statements as of and for (i) the calendar year ended December 31, 2016; (ii) the eight months ended December 31, 2015; and (iii) the fiscal years ended April 30, 2015 and 2014.

In the opinion of management, the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the eight months ended December 31, 2014 reflects all adjustments necessary to present the financial position and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Prior to the year-end change, our fiscal year ended on April 30 of each year.
 
  Business Strategy
 
 Our principal business objective is to identify, develop, and commercialize novel therapeutic products for disease indications that represent significant areas of clinical need and commercial opportunity. The key elements of our business strategy are outlined below.
 
  Efficiently conduct clinical development to establish clinical proof of concept with our lead product candidates. Levosimendan represents novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of LCOS and other critical care conditions. We are conducting clinical development with the intent to establish proof of concept in several important disease areas where these therapeutics would be expected to have benefit. Our focus is on conducting well-designed studies to establish a robust foundation for subsequent development, partnership and expansion into complementary areas.
 
  Efficiently explore new high potential therapeutic applications, leveraging third-party research collaborations and our results from related areas. Our product candidates have shown promise in multiple disease areas. We are committed to exploring potential clinical indications where our therapies may achieve best-in-class profile, and where we can address significant unmet medical needs. In order to achieve this goal, we have established collaborative research relationships with [investigators from research and clinical institutions and] our strategic partners. These collaborative relationships have enabled us to cost effectively explore where our product candidates may have therapeutic relevance, and how it may be utilized to advance treatment over current clinical care. Additionally, we believe we will be able to leverage clinical safety data and preclinical results from some programs to support accelerated clinical development efforts in other areas, saving substantial development time and resources compared to traditional drug development.
 
  Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Our intellectual property is important to our business and we take significant steps to protect its value. We have ongoing research and development efforts, both through internal activities and through collaborative research activities with others, which aim to develop new intellectual property and enable us to file patent applications that cover new applications of our existing technologies or product candidates.
 
  Enter into licensing or product co-development arrangements in certain areas, while out-licensing opportunities in non-core areas. In addition to our internal development efforts, an important part of our product development strategy is to work with collaborators and partners to accelerate product development, reduce our development costs, and broaden our commercialization capabilities. We believe this strategy will help us to develop a portfolio of high quality product development opportunities, enhance our clinical development and commercialization capabilities, and increase our ability to generate value from our proprietary technologies.
 
  Our Current Programs
 
  Levosimendan Background
 
 Levosimendan was discovered and developed by Orion Pharma, a Finnish company. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer/K-ATP activator developed for intravenous use in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. It is currently approved in over 60 countries for this indication and not available in the United States or Canada. It is estimated that to date over 1,000,000 patients have been treated worldwide with levosimendan.
 
 Levosimendan is a novel, first in class calcium sensitizer/K-ATP activator. The therapeutic effects of levosimendan are mediated through:
  
   ●
 Increased cardiac contractility by calcium sensitization of troponin C, resulting in a positive inotropic effect which is not associated with substantial increases in oxygen demand.

   ●
 Opening of potassium channels in the vasculature smooth muscle, resulting in a vasodilatory effect on all vascular beds.

   ●
 Opening of mitochondrial potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, resulting in a cardioprotective effect.

 This triple mechanism of action helps to preserve heart function during cardiac surgery. Several studies have demonstrated that levosimendan protects the heart and improves tissue perfusion while minimizing tissue damage during cardiac surgery.
 
 In 2013, we acquired certain assets of Phyxius Pharma, Inc., or Phyxius, including its North American rights to develop and commercialize levosimendan for any indication in the United States and Canada. In the countries where levosimendan is marketed, Levosimendan is indicated for the short-term treatment of acutely decompensated severe chronic heart failure in situations where conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate. In acute decompensated heart failure patients, levosimendan has been shown to significantly improve patients’ symptoms as well as acute hemodynamic measurements such as increased cardiac output, reduced preload and reduced afterload. Other unique properties of levosimendan include sustained efficacy through the formation of a long acting metabolite, lack of impairment of diastolic function, and evidence of better compatibility with beta blockers than dobutamine.
 
  The European Society of Cardiology, or the ESC, recommends levosimendan as a preferable agent over dobutamine to reverse the effect of beta blockade if it is thought to be contributing to hypotension. The ESC guidelines also state that levosimendan is not appropriate for patients with systolic blood pressure less than 85mmHg or in patients in cardiogenic shock unless it is used in combination with other inotropes or vasopressors.
  
 Levosimendan Development for Cardiac Surgery Patients
 
 Levosimendan is under development in North America for reduction in morbidity and mortality of cardiac surgery patients at risk of LCOS. As noted above, we have the exclusive rights in the United States and Canada to develop and commercialize intravenous levosimendan.
 
 The FDA granted Fast Track status for the development of levosimendan to reduce mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery patients at risk of LCOS and agreed to an SPA which represents agreement with the Phase III clinical trial’s study protocol. The FDA also provided guidance that a single successful trial will be sufficient to support approval of levosimendan in this indication. Pursuant to our license to levosimendan, we are required to use the “Simdax®” trademark to commercialize this product.
 
 Substantial published scientific research indicates that levosimendan may provide important benefits to cardiac surgery patients, including 35 published prospectively designed clinical trials and multiple published meta-analyses. Many of these publications indicate that levosimendan provides substantial mortality and or morbidity benefits to cardiac surgery patients, particularly those at risk of developing LCOS.
  
 LCOS is generally defined as a patient’s inability to maintain a cardiac index >2.2 L/min/m2 and hence requiring use of inotropic agents and/or mechanical assist devices such as an intra-aortic balloon pump or a left ventricular assistance device. LCOS in the cardiac surgery setting is reported to occur in 5-10% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with 10-15 fold higher mortality or severe sequelae as a result of poor organ perfusion.
  
 Currently, no pharmacologic therapies are approved for management or prevention of post-cardiotomy LCOS. While conventional inotropes are used to manage cardiac hemodynamics in the peri-operative setting, none have been shown to improve outcomes.
  
 In 2014, we initiated a Phase III trial (LEVO-CTS) to investigate the safety and efficacy of pre-operative administration of levosimendan treatment to reduce the mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery patients at risk for developing LCOS. The Phase III trial was conducted under a United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, and with FDA granted Fast Track status for the development of levosimendan in cardiac surgery patients at risk of LCOS.
  
 The LEVO-CTS trial design was guided by the published literature, including important dosing refinements and inclusion of patients with low preoperative ejection fraction. In addition, we relied heavily on the input of European clinicians who have significant personal clinical experience with the use of levosimendan in treating cardiac surgery patients.
  
 Current data in cardiac surgery suggest that levosimendan is superior to traditional inotropes (dobutamine, phosphodiesterase [PDE]-inhibitors) as it achieves:
 
   ●
 sustained hemodynamic improvement;

   ●
 diminished myocardial injury;

   ●
 improved tissue perfusion;

   ●
 better outcomes and fewer hospital days;

   ●
 effects most favorable in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< 40%); and

   ●
 opportunity to initiate therapy pre-operatively due to increased cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular calcium, without increasing oxygen consumption, or affecting cardiac rhythm and relaxation.

 We selected Duke University’s Duke Clinical Research Institute, or DCRI, to conduct the Phase III trial of levosimendan. DCRI is the world’s largest academic clinical research organization, with substantial experience in conducting cardiac surgery trials. The Phase III trial was conducted in approximately 60-70 major cardiac surgery centers in North America. The trial enrolled patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts, or CABG, and/or mitral valve surgery, and CABG with aortic valve surgery who are at risk for developing LCOS. The trial was designed as a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study seeking to enroll 760 patients. During 2016 we made the decision to increase enrollment in the LEVO-CTS trial to 880 patients. These additional patients were necessary to ensure sufficient powering and were necessary due to:
  
   ●
 a small percentage of patients who were randomized but did not receive the study drug;

   ●
 a small percentage of patients who were missing one or more component measurements of the primary endpoint; and

   ●
 a slightly lower primary endpoint event rate than we originally projected.

 
  Enrollment began in the third quarter of calendar year 2014, and was completed in December of 2016. On January 31, 2017, we announced top-line results from the Phase III LEVO-CTS trial. Levosimendan, given prophylactically prior to cardiac surgery to patients with reduced left ventricular function, had no effect on the co-primary outcomes. The study did not achieve statistically significant reductions in the dual endpoint of death or use of a mechanical assist device at 30 days, nor in the quad endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, need for dialysis, or use of a mechanical assist device at 30 days.
  
  However, the study results demonstrated statistically significant reductions in two of three secondary endpoints including reduction in LCOS and a reduction in postoperative use of secondary inotropes. Additionally, levosimendan was found to be safe with no clinically significant increases in hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias and the clinical data showed a non-significant numerical reduction in 90-day mortality.
  
  Notwithstanding the fact that the trial’s primary endpoints were not statistically significant, and given the statistically significant reductions in the secondary endpoints, we continue to believe levosimendan is an effective and safe inotrope to increase cardiac output in patients at risk for or with perioperative low cardiac output. Following the announcement of the Phase III LEVO-CTS top-line results, we held a meeting with the FDA to review the preliminary trial data and discuss a path forward to file a NDA for levosimendan. As a follow-up to this meeting, a pre-NDA meeting has been scheduled with the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 to discuss the data that supports the approval of levosimendan for acute decompensated heart failure. The FDA may not approve levosimendan for this or any other indication, and if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize levosimendan in the U.S.
  
 Levosimendan Development for Septic Shock Patients
  
 Septic shock is a serious life-threatening condition with high unmet medical need. Small clinical studies suggest that levosimendan may provide important benefits to septic shock patients in the form of improved cardiac function, renal function, organ perfusion, and mitochondrial function. We announced a collaboration with Imperial College London in August of 2014 which provided supplemental funding to support the accelerated enrollment and completion of the ongoing LeoPARDS Trial (Levosimendan for the Prevention of Acute oRgan Dysfunction in Sepsis). The LeoPARDS trial was designed to determine whether levosimendan reduces the incidence and severity of acute organ dysfunction in adult patients who have septic shock, as well as evaluate its safety profile.

 On October 5, 2016, Anthony Gordon, M.D., Chair in Anaesthesia and Critical Care, Imperial College London, presented results from the LeoPARDS trial evaluating levosimendan in septic shock at the 29th Annual Congress of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), held in Milan, Italy. Results presented by Dr. Gordon show that the levosimendan treatment arm did not achieve the trial’s primary endpoint of reducing the incidence and severity of acute organ dysfunction in adult patients who have septic shock, as well as the pre-specified secondary endpoints. Based upon these results seen, we do not anticipate undertaking further development with levosimendan in the septic shock indication.
  
  Other Products
  
 In addition to levosimendan described above, we have previously developed Oxycyte, a PFC-based oxygen carrier, our Dermacyte® line of topical cosmetic products, which contained our PFC technology and other known cosmetic ingredients to promote the appearance of skin health and other desirable cosmetic benefits, as well as Wundecyte™, a novel gel developed under a contract agreement with a lab in Virginia that was designed to be used as a wound-healing gel.  As we have suspended the development of these PFC products while we evaluate strategic alternatives, we do not expect that Oxycyte, Dermacyte or Wundecyte constitute a material portion of our business going forward.
 Suppliers
 
 Pursuant to the terms of our license for levosimendan, Orion Corporation is our sole manufacturing source for levosimendan.
 
  Intellectual Property
 
 We rely on a combination of patent applications, patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We believe that to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies.

  Competition
 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research and development of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working. We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop.
 
  We believe the concept of using a medication to treat low cardiac output syndrome is novel. Because therapies are currently approved or commonly used to treat LCOS, our ability to succeed in the market is dependent on our ability to change the established practice paradigm, which is never an easy task. Key factors on which we will compete with regards to the development and marketing of levosimendan for the treatment of LCOS include, among others, the ability to obtain adequate efficacy data, safety data, cost effectiveness data and hospital formulary approval, as well as sufficient distribution and handling. Furthermore, while we believe the mechanism of action of levosimendan is novel, other low priced generically available products possess some similar qualities, which could present competition in the form of therapeutic substitution.
  
 In order to compete successfully in this and other therapeutic areas, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
 
  Government regulation
 
 The manufacture and distribution of levosimendan will require the approval of United States government authorities as well as those of foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates medical products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our medical products. In addition to FDA regulations, we are also subject to other federal and state regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial funds.
 
 Preclinical tests include evaluation of product chemistry and studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product and its formulation. The results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of the application. The goal of clinical testing is the demonstration in adequate and well-controlled studies of substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product in the setting of its intended use. The results of preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the FDA from time to time throughout the trial process. In addition, before approval for the commercial sale of a product can be obtained, results of the preclinical and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the condition being treated, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additional preclinical studies or clinical trials may be requested during the FDA review process and may delay product approval. After FDA approval for its initial indications, further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of a product for additional indications. The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, which can involve significant expense, to monitor for adverse effects.

 As noted above, following the announcement of the Phase III LEVO-CTS top-line results, we held a meeting with the FDA to review the preliminary trial data and discuss a path forward to file a NDA for levosimendan. As a follow-up to this meeting, a pre-NDA meeting has been scheduled with the FDA in the second quarter of 2017.
 
  Research and Development
 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on the development and commercialization of levosimendan for its use in clinical indications, primarily LCOS. Previously, we were also focused on furthering the development and manufacture of Oxycyte for its use in clinical indications, primarily TBI, spinal cord injury, and decompression sickness. However, we have suspended the development of Oxycyte while we evaluate strategic alternatives.
 
 We spent approximately $13.1 million and $6.5 million on research and development during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the eight months ended December 31, 2015, respectively. During each of the fiscal years ended April 30, 2015 and 2014 we spent approximately $6.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively, on research and development.
 
  Employees
 
 We believe that our success will be based on, among other things, the quality of our clinical programs, our ability to invent and develop superior and innovative technologies and products, and our ability to attract and retain capable management and other personnel. We have assembled a high quality team of scientists, clinical development managers, and executives with significant experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had ten full-time employees and one part-time employee. In addition to our employees, we also use the service and support of outside consultants and advisors. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we believe relationships with our employees are good.
