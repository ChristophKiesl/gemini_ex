 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 General
 Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. These services and products can enable our clients to evaluate and improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their new and existing fields. We have over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and have approximately 3,600 employees.
 On January 17, 2023, the Company announced its intention to reorganize the Company’s corporate structure, which will include redomestication (the “Redomestication”) of the parent company from the Netherlands to the United States as Core Laboratories Inc., a Delaware corporation. Following shareholder approval, the Redomestication will be completed through a series of steps, as follows:
(i)Core Laboratories N.V. will merge with and into Core Laboratories Luxembourg S.A, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Core Laboratories N.V., with Core Laboratories Luxembourg S.A. surviving, and 
 (ii)As soon as practicable thereafter, Core Laboratories Luxembourg S.A. will migrate out of Luxembourg and redomesticate into the state of Delaware, as Core Laboratories Inc., which will become the ultimate parent company.
 Upon completion of the transaction, Core Laboratories N.V. shareholders will hold one share of common stock of Core Laboratories Inc. for each common share of Core Laboratories N.V. owned immediately prior to the Redomestication. The Company’s shares will continue to trade uninterrupted during and upon completion of the Redomestication.
 The Redomestication requires a shareholder vote for approval, which will be conducted through an extraordinary general meeting of the Company’s shareholders, anticipated to occur in late March of 2023. If shareholder approval is obtained, the transaction is expected to become effective approximately 30 days following the date of the extraordinary general meeting.
References to "Core Lab", "the Company", "we", "our", and similar phrases are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated affiliates.
 Business Strategy
 Our business strategy is to provide advanced technologies that improve reservoir performance by (i) continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client-driven research and development, (ii) expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and (iii) acquiring complementary technologies that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing services and products.
Development of New Technologies, Services and Products
 We conduct research and development to meet the needs of our clients who are continually seeking new services and technologies to lower their costs of finding, developing and producing oil and gas. While the aggregate number of wells being drilled per year has fluctuated relative to market conditions, oil and gas producers have, on a proportional basis, increased expenditures on technology services to improve their understanding of the reservoir, increase production of oil and gas from their producing fields, and more recently, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (“CCS”) projects. We intend to continue concentrating our efforts on services and technologies that improve reservoir performance, increase oil and gas recovery, CCS projects and other projects directed at the global objectives in reducing carbon emissions.
International Expansion of Services and Products
 Another component of our business strategy is to broaden the spectrum of services and products offered to our clients on a global basis. We intend to continue using our worldwide network of offices to offer our services and products that have been developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. This global emphasis allows us to enhance our revenue through efficient utilization of our worldwide network.
Acquisitions
 We continually review potential acquisitions to add key services and technologies, enhance market presence or complement existing business.
 More information relating to any significant acquisitions is included in Note 3 - Acquisitions and Divestures of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Operations
 We derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry.
 We operate our business in two segments. These complementary operating segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for evaluating and improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. Disclosure relating to the operations and financial information of these operating segments is included in Note 22 - Segment Reporting and Other Disaggregated Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 •Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock, and reservoir fluids samples to increase production and improve recovery of crude oil and natural gas from our clients' reservoirs. We provide laboratory-based analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and crude oil-derived products to the oil and gas industry. We also provide proprietary and joint industry studies based on these types of analyses and manufacture associated laboratory equipment. In addition, we provide reservoir description capabilities that support various activities associated with energy transition projects, including services that support carbon capture, utilization and storage, hydrogen storage, geothermal projects, and the evaluation and appraisal of mining activities around lithium and other elements necessary for energy storage.
 •Production Enhancement: Includes services and manufactured products associated with reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulation, production and well abandonment. We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects.
 We offer our services worldwide through a global network of offices. Services accounted for 71%, 73% and 77% of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 We manufacture products primarily in five facilities for distribution on a global basis. Product sales accounted for 29%, 27% and 23% of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Reservoir Description
 Commercial oil and gas fields consist of porous and permeable reservoir rocks that contain crude oil, natural gas and formation water. Due to the density differences of the fluids, natural gas typically caps the field and overlies an oil layer, which overlies the water. We provide services that characterize the porous reservoir rock, all three reservoir fluids and their derived products. Services relating to these fluids include determining the quality and measuring the quantity of the reservoir fluids and their derived products, such as gasoline, diesel and biofuels. This includes determining the value of different crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. Reservoir fluid analyses contribute approximately 65% to 70% of Reservoir Description revenue. We also provide more advanced laboratory analyses which measure reservoir hydrocarbons at reservoir conditions to determine the changes in the hydrocarbon's physical properties with changing pressure and temperature.
 We analyze samples of reservoir rocks for their porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for their permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced. We also use our proprietary services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and other subsurface data.
 The combined use of both the reservoir rock and fluid data are invaluable to oil companies to determine the most efficient method and optimize the recovery, processing and refinement of these hydrocarbons. Early evaluations and key decisions about well performance and viability are important for optimizing a reservoir. This is accomplished by using proprietary and patented laboratory methods, including both traditional physical measurements and more recently introduced new technologies, such as Core Lab’s Non-Invasive Technologies for Reservoir OptimizationSM (“NITROSM”) services. NITROSM services includes Dual Energy Computed Tomography ("DECT"), Micro Computed Tomography, high and low frequency nuclear magnetic

resonance, high-resolution gamma logging and continuous high energy x-ray fluorescence, along with other Core Lab proprietary technologies.
 Core Lab's proprietary DECT scanner-based deliverables generate millimeter-scale three dimensional images and accompanying high-resolution petrophysical logs on cored intervals by calibrating DECT information to the vast library of physical measurements in Core Lab's proprietary database. The DECT deliverables from Core Lab are more detailed than down-hole logs and provide better bed resolution as well as accurate information on rock properties such as lithology, porosity, density, rock strength and acoustic velocities.
 DECT, when combined with Continuous Dual Gamma and Scanning X-ray Fluorescence (“CS-XRF”), allows Core Lab to assess continuous high-resolution elemental composition of the cored intervals. A proprietary formation-specific “inversion” technique can be used to convert the detailed elemental composition to a continuous mineral log enabling us to generate detailed lithologic descriptions of the reservoir and to perform a comprehensive reservoir characterization.
 Core Lab conducts a wide variety of physical laboratory measurements to measure and evaluate fluid flow through the rock, often at in-situ reservoir temperatures and pressures. These are most commonly applied to conventional reservoirs. We have also developed unique analytical processes to understand the flow characteristics and saturation profiles of unconventional reservoir systems including (1) High Frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements to gain insights into movable vs. non-movable fluid saturations of these complex systems; and (2) Enhanced Oil Recovery of shale reservoirs by evaluating the effectiveness of gas cycling in nano-pore structures to significantly increase long-term production rates and volumes.
 Core Lab has been at the forefront of digital transformation technologies for more than two decades. Core Lab’s extensive, proprietary databases and analog technologies, coupled with artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning, help our clients improve efficiencies and lower operating costs throughout the upstream value chain. The analysis and integration, of these critical datasets is enhanced because of Core Lab’s proprietary RAPIDTM database. Core Lab’s Digital Innovation Group works collaboratively with multiple international and national oil companies on projects that utilize several of Core Lab’s proprietary digital technologies and services. Core Lab’s proprietary Advanced Rock Typing technology combines Core Lab’s vast, comprehensive database of physical measurements, and World Wide Rock CatalogTM with its proprietary image acquisition technology and innovative AI image recognition. Core Lab’s proprietary World Wide Rock CatalogTM provides a database and analog reference set for predicting properties when physical measurements are unavailable. These technologies provide clients with analog data sets in situations where acquisition of new conventional core may not be possible. High-resolution images of wellbore cuttings and sidewall cores are quickly and efficiently matched with analogs from Core Lab’s proprietary database of samples from around the world. Physically measured data sets from the matching analogs are delivered to our clients in time to make appraisal and development decisions.
 Core Lab’s proprietary legacy portfolio of geological studies and rock and fluid property datasets on conventional reservoirs and seals, accessible through Core Lab’s database platform, RAPIDTM, are being leveraged in energy transition projects as well, and are proving invaluable to operators evaluating potential CCS sites in onshore and offshore Miocene and Oligocene reservoirs along the U.S. Gulf Coast. These legacy studies, originally conducted to evaluate hydrocarbon reservoirs, provide critical data for reconnaissance, benchmarking, and risk reduction ahead of new coring projects for CCS site assessment.
 Core Lab’s Digital Innovation Group integrates results and interpretations into a comprehensive, web-enabled platform, RAPIDTM, for client access. This allows our clients to gain insight into their core intervals at an accelerated pace, for both non-invasive technologies as well as time-honored physical laboratory measurements. Through this integrated visually interactive platform, key reservoir performance indicators are presented, evaluated and shared within client workgroups.
 Core Lab also applies its rock fluid and data analytical capabilities to CO2 and other gas and liquid projects. These projects may be for enhanced oil recovery in mature fields, or for CO-CCS projects.
 Core Lab holds various patents, trade secrets, and proprietary designs for laboratory equipment required to analyze reservoir rocks as well as the properties and phase behavior of reservoir fluids and derived products. We manufacture a wide range of ambient and reservoir condition rock and fluid analysis laboratory equipment for our own use throughout our international laboratory network. Among these devices are complex, high-pressure, high temperature, reservoir condition, multi-phase flow systems and full visualization Pressure-Volume-Temperature cells, along with the ancillary equipment required to support these laboratory programs. We also sell equipment of this type to universities, government institutes, and client company research labs.
 While recognizing the need to optimize the logistical chain of our clients, from producing well to retail sales of petroleum products, a state-of-the-art IT platform CONNECT: was launched to efficiently acquire and optimize workflows of our field data, laboratory analysis, and any other observations relevant to our client base. The system is designed for single data entry,

and that data can be used for further analysis and, more importantly, be shared with our clients by process flow dashboards with key performance indicators. The system can also share real-time data on mobile devices, enabling our clients to make quick decisions. This methodology of sharing data has been embraced by an increasing number of clients, as it has not only saved them costs, but, more importantly, the data can be used for trend analysis in many ways, such as the ability to forecast bottlenecks, thus eliminating waste and increasing efficiency. Two experience centers have been set up, in the U.S. and Europe, where our clients can get acquainted with optimizing the flow of business as well as our advanced systems for data analysis. All initiatives are meant to increase efficiency and add value to our client base. All data is being made available through dashboard technology, which for internal purposes is being used to measure the efficiency of workflows throughout the organization.
We added new modules to our suite of IT platforms in 2021 that enhance the distribution chain of our customers, with similar structure of using dashboard technology, enabling the customer to monitor live progress as well as operational data.
 We conduct numerous large-scale, multi-company reservoir management projects, applying proprietary and state-of-the-art techniques from the earliest phases of a field development program until the last economic barrel of oil is recovered. We initiate and deliver a group of international and U.S. based consortium studies to evaluate both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. These projects are of increasing importance to oil companies as the incremental barrel is often the lowest cost and most profitable barrel in the reservoir. Producing incremental barrels increases our clients' cash flows which we believe will result in additional capital expenditures by our clients, and ultimately further opportunities for us.
 These industry consortium projects provide critical reservoir information to a broad spectrum of clients in a cost effective manner. These studies focus on regions of client interest across the globe, and include both conventional and unconventional reservoir targets. Studies often run for several years and new studies are initiated in response of current or upcoming client activity in a region. Core Lab retains rights of ownership to complete joint industry projects studies, which can be resold at a later date. Many of them examine unconventional reservoirs, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. For example, our Permian Basin study evaluates the petrophysical, geochemical, completion and production characteristics of this very active play in West Texas. Our clients use this information, not only to improve their drilling and production activities, but also to evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture opportunities.
  Our data bases, technology and analytical methods also allow us to assist our clients in other ways. Many of our clients have begun investing in and developing other sources of energy, including renewables. Some of these initiatives include deployment of technologies associated with the assessment of strata to establish strategies tied to hydrogen storage and mining of elements such as lithium, which are critical components of batteries for energy storage. Our measuring and analytical techniques may also be used to assist our clients with reporting requirements associated with carbon emissions.
Production Enhancement
 Core Lab's Production Enhancement group provides products and diagnostic services to help optimize well completions, reservoir operations and field development strategies, in order to increase recoverable reserves in the most efficient way. These product offerings include perforating technologies to establish communication between the wellbore and the reservoir. Diagnostic services are used to assess well completions and field floods. Two commonly used production enhancement methods are (i) hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir rock to improve flow and (ii) flooding a reservoir with water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or hydrocarbon gases to drive more oil and gas to the producing wellbores. Many oilfields today are hydraulically fractured and/or flooded to maximize oil and gas recovery. Although Core Lab is not a hydraulic fracturing company, Core Lab does provide services that are used by operators to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects and to evaluate the success of those projects. These services, products and expertise play a key role in the success of both methodologies.
 The hydraulic fracturing of a producing formation is achieved by pumping a fluid slurry containing a proppant material into the reservoir zone at extremely high pressures. This fractures the rock and the proppant material "props" or holds the fracture open after the pressure pumping is complete, so that reservoir fluids can flow through a highly conductive fracture into the production wellbore. Data on rock type and strength generated in the Reservoir Description operating segment are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing treatment. In addition, further testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would otherwise restrict production. Core Lab also provides testing of various propping agents and software to help select the best propping agent based on net present value calculations of client investments. The proprietary and patented ZERO WASH® tracer technology is used to confirm optimum cluster efficiency, stage spacing, stimulated reservoir volume and increased ultimate recovery.
 SPECTRACHEM®, a chemical frac water tracing service, is another proprietary and patented technology developed for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM® is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracturing fluids used. SPECTRACHEM® tracers enable operators to evaluate the quantity of fracturing fluid and reservoir fluid

that returns to the wellbore after a hydraulic fracturing event. This technology also enables clients to evaluate load recovery, gas breakthrough, fluid leak-off and breaker efficiency, all of which are important factors for optimizing oil and/or natural gas production after the formation is hydraulically fractured.
 The SPECTRACHEM® service is used for determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of long, multi-stage horizontal wells in oil- and gas-shale plays in unconventional reservoirs. SPECTRACHEM® data sets are used to determine if and how effectively each frac stage is flowing. Frac stages with ineffective flows may warrant further stimulation or remedial actions, while guiding improvements in future frac designs and flowback procedures.
 Core Lab's engineers have developed and implemented new applications for the proprietary SPECTRACHEM ® service to determine whether horizontal wells are unobstructed and flowing through the entire length of a horizontal well. Leveraged by operators in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Wolfcamp, Bakken and Haynesville plays, this technology can identify wellbore obstructions, often caused by inter-well communication, wellbore fill, or dissolvable plug remnants. By applying this technology, clients can identify and remediate well obstructions that can negatively impact well performance, reserve calculations and reserve-based lending.
 Another unique completion monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. This provides clients with a baseline of early production information that can be compared to subsequent data later in the life of the well to see how hydrocarbon production from different reservoir layers or different quality rock varies over time.
 The FLOWPROFILERTM service, a proprietary hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which is a further development of the patented SPECTRACHEM® technology quantifies the hydrocarbon production from discrete segments in multi-stage horizontal well completions in unconventional tight-oil or gas plays. This service incorporates both liquid and solid controlled-release, oil-soluble tracers for oil reservoirs which are different from gas tracers used for gas reservoirs. FLOWPROFILERTM technology and the analytical methodology for identifying the hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are the protected intellectual property of Core Lab.
 The FLOWPROFILERTM technology employs unique hydrocarbon-soluble tracers and water-soluble tracers introduced into specific, physically isolated stages via the stimulation proppant stream. The hydrocarbon-soluble tracers partition into the crude oil and gas associated with each stage, while the water-soluble tracers remain in the stimulation fluid. When the well is flowed, oil, gas and water samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory to identify and quantify oil or gas flows from each stage as well as the cleanup of the stimulation fluid. Stages not at optimum flow rates can be identified, precipitating remedial efforts to increase flow and recovery rates, and providing valuable insights for future wells. This service is used to monitor offset well interference by sampling offset well oil, gas and water production. The amount of tracer detected in offset wells is used to help clients optimize both horizontal and vertical well spacing and the optimum amount of fracturing fluids for each stage.
 There has been a broadening acceptance of FLOWPROFILERTMEDS, a proprietary technology, which is an engineered delivery system ("EDS"). The break-through EDS technology delivers time-released diagnostics for evaluating the crude-oil flow from each stage of a hydraulically fractured completion. This technology comprises proprietary 40/70 or 100 mesh particles, chemically engineered to bond specifically with proprietary oil tracers. This allows for precise placement of tracers in the propped fracture, thus providing accurate identification of oil production by stage. Crude-oil production by stage is determined using this Core Lab-developed technology that enables the diagnostic tracer to be absorbed and chemically bonded to durable, proppant-size particles that are injected with the frac sand. The tracer will release from the engineered particles once they contact the reservoir's crude oil, enabling Core Lab to assess which stages are contributing to crude-oil production.
 Core Lab also conducts dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to realistically simulate the flooding of a producing zone. Patented technologies, such as Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays ("SMAXTM"), help in designing the enhanced recovery projects. After a field flood is initiated, Core Lab is often involved in monitoring the progress of the flood to ensure that the maximum amount of incremental production is achieved using the SPECTRAFLOODTM technology, which was developed to optimize sweep efficiency during field floods.
 Core Lab's patented PACKSCAN® technology is used to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in unconsolidated reservoirs. PACKSCAN® measures density changes in the gravel pack annulus to verify the competency of the gravel pack without requiring any additional rig time.
 In addition to Core Lab's many patented reservoir diagnostic technologies, Production Enhancement has established itself as a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of high-performance perforating products. Core Lab's unique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems engineered to maximize well

productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage caused during the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. This "systems" approach to the perforation of an oil or gas well has resulted in numerous patented products.
 SuperHEROTM (High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization) and HERO-HRTM (Hard Rock) are examples of the patented perforating systems. The SuperHEROTM charge evolved from the HEROTM charge technology and use a proprietary and patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology resulting in a deeper and cleaner perforating tunnel into the oil and gas reservoir. This allows greater flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. The more recent charge development of the HERO-HRTM charges, resulted in Core Lab also having the deepest penetrating perforating charges on the market as certified by API testing.
 HEROTMPerFRAC leverages the HEROTM technology. In addition to the benefits of HEROTM technology, HEROTMPerFRAC charges are designed specifically for optimizing fracture stimulation well completions by providing low standard deviation which minimizes tortuosity effects. This results in less required surface horsepower and less time which both translate into lower costs needed to complete the fracturing operation. In addition to optimizing stimulation operations with faster, lower cost programs, well production is also enhanced by not only the better well stimulations but the improved near debris free perforation tunnels as the well fluids come back into the casing from the rock. Core Lab's manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada continue to meet the global demand for our perforating systems through facility expansion in addition to gains in efficiency and productivity.
 Consistent with the HEROTMPerFRAC uniform hole size option, the ReFRAC product line was also introduced and has experienced increasing client acceptance. The ReFRAC technology is utilized in mechanically isolated re-stimulation programs where the internal string is used to isolate older, depleted stages in previously under-stimulated wells. The ReFRAC technology creates a uniform hole size through two strings of casing. This re-completion method is gaining popularity because it allows operators to perforate, pump and stimulate new rock between the original stages of the well, increasing hydrocarbon recovery without the expense of drilling and completing a new well. Operators using Core Lab’s ReFRAC technology have reported they can now complete twice as many stages per day compared to conventional perforating systems, reducing their operating costs and improving cash flow.
 The HEROTM line of perforating charges, HEROTMPerFRAC, SuperHEROTM, HERO-HRTM and ReFRAC charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would otherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation programs needed for prolific production from the Permian Basin, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar oil- and gas-shale formations.
 Core Lab’s proprietary downhole energetic solutions and instrumentation are designed to systemize, simplify, automate, and de-risk the deployment of perforating systems, which are utilized by international oil and gas operators for well completions. The Ballistics Delivery System (“BDSTM”) provides a unique range of perforating tools and equipment, which have been developed to provide a number of advantages over existing technology. The BDSTM tools facilitate perforation accuracy while addressing wellbore assurance concerns and optimizing safety, thus alleviating some of the challenges encountered when perforating. It also assists with issues incurred with high underbalanced perforating, running heavy/long assemblies, oriented perforating, depth control, reduction in fishing risk, and acquiring wellbore pressure data as guns fire. Core Lab’s BDS TM and the GoFire Addressable Switch are key differentiators of Core Lab’s preassembled GoGunTM Adaptive Perforating System. The GoGunTM Adaptive Perforating System provides an open architecture design. This allows for optimal utilization of perforating energetics and, importantly, the onsite flexibility of altering completion designs for greater wellsite efficiency and improved Stimulated Reservoir Volume.
 Core Lab's next generation, HEROTMPerFRAC energetic technology, is available in combination with the new, patent pending Oriented GoGun. This new offering provides our clients with a technological solution for achieving: 1) extreme limited entry perforating capability, 2) precisely aligned perforations, and 3) minimized connections and completion string length. Casing erosion around perforations can occur when stimulating unconventional reservoirs. Larger perforating holes preferentially increase in size and take more frac fluid, robbing stimulation from smaller perforating holes, which results in inconsistent breakdown of the formation. The consistent-sized holes generated by the latest HEROTMPerFRAC charges reduce this problem. Core Lab partnered with major U.S. operators to design custom, consistent-hole-size charges that can be aligned in a specific orientation in order to achieve uniform breakdown across each stage. By eliminating the need for reusable orientation subassemblies, the Oriented GoGunTM minimizes the number of connections and saves time at the wellsite by not having to recapture and redress the orienting subs.
Core Lab’s Production Enhancement operating segment commissioned a cutting-edge, Reservoir Optimized Completions Lab (“ROC LabTM”) in Godley, Texas. The ROC LabTM is designed to determine the best energetic solutions for a specific rock type, to maximize productivity of an operator’s reservoir. The ROC LabTM features an industry-leading, Ultra High Pressure/High Temperature perforation test vessel. The test vessel is paired with a proprietary flow system that uses highly

specialized, internally developed and manufactured pumps and flow controllers. Combined, these technologies create a proprietary flow loop capable of dynamically displacing oil, brine and gas through rock samples that have been perforated with preselected energetics. Core Lab leverages its multi-decade expertise in conducting multi-phase fluid flow tests through porous medium to optimize this technological investment.
 Core Lab’s proprietary Plug and Abandonment Perforating System (“PACTM”) is utilized to optimize a slot recovery process through a lean casing recovery program. PACTM  allows for reduced rig time and efficient recovery of the interior casing, while eliminating risks and creating opportunities for production from untapped reservoir sections.
 Core Lab's Production Enhancement team has experienced technical services personnel to support clients through our global network of offices for the everyday use of our perforating systems and the rapid introduction of new products. Our personnel are capable of providing client training and on-site services in the completion of oil and gas wells. The patented X-SPAN® and GTX-SPAN® casing patches are supported by our technical services personnel. Market applications in Canada's steam-assisted gravity drainage environment have resulted in an upgrade in temperature ratings to as much as 600°F. These systems are capable of performing in high temperature as well as high pressure oil and gas environments and are used to seal non-productive reservoir zones from the producing wellbore.
 Marketing and Sales
 We market and sell our services and products through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. Direct sales and marketing are carried out by our sales force, technical experts and operating managers, as well as by sales representatives and distributors in various markets where we do not have offices. Our Business Development group manages a Large Account Management Program to better serve our largest and most active clients by meeting with key personnel within their organizations to ensure the quality of our services and products are meeting their expectations and addressing any issues or needs in a timely manner.
Research and Development
 The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and frequent product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. Many of our acquisitions have allowed us to obtain the benefits of the acquired company's research and development projects without incurring significant costs if we had attempted to develop the services and products ourselves. We incur costs as part of internal research and development, and these costs are charged to expense as incurred and reflected in the operational results of the associated operating segment. We intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new services and products. Over the years, we have made a number of technological advances, including the development of key technologies utilized in our operations. Substantially all of our new technologies are the result of requests and guidance from our clients, particularly major oil companies.
Patents and Trademarks
 We believe our patents, trademarks, technology, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are an important factor in maintaining our technological advantage, although no single one of these is considered essential to our success. Typically, we will seek to protect our intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we believe the cost of such protection is warranted. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology even where regarded as patentable. We protect our intellectual property, including through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements, legal enforcement proceedings and by other means.
International Operations
 We operate facilities in more than 50 countries. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 66%, 68% and 67% of our revenue from operations during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed rather than where the reservoir or project is located, while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of service revenue performed and recorded in the U.S. that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields.
 The following graphs and table summarize our reported revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:




 | United States | | Europe/Africa/ Middle East | | Asia Pacific | Canada | | Former Soviet Union | | Latin/ South America | Consolidated | 
2022 | $ | 166,701 | | $ | 200,863 | $ | 32,688 | | $ | 27,797 | $ | 29,514 | $ | 32,172 | $ | 489,735

 While we are subject to fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount in which our foreign contracts are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. However, the ultimate decision as to the proportion of the foreign currency component within a contract usually resides with our clients. Consequently, we are not always able to eliminate our foreign currency exposure. We have not historically engaged in and are not currently engaged in any significant currency hedging or trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations.
 Environment and Climate
Governmental Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment. Compliance with environmental legal requirements in the United States at the federal, state or local levels may require acquiring permits to conduct regulated activities, incurring capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions, discharges and any unauthorized releases, and complying with stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, the occurrence of delays or cancellations in the permitting, performance or expansion of projects and the issuance of injunctive relief in affected areas.
We have developed policies and procedures associated with the management, handling, recycling or disposal of chemicals and gases and other materials and wastes resulting from our operations. In areas where environmental regulations do not exist, we have established other policies and procedures in efforts to preserve the environment.
 Additionally, our analytical and manufacturing processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of wastes. Spills or other unauthorized releases of these chemicals, gases, and wastes at our facilities, whether by us or prior owners or operators, or at offsite locations where we transport them for recycling or disposal, could subject us to environmental liability, either from the applicable government agency or private landowners or other third parties. Such liabilities could be strict, joint and several, as is applicable in the United States under such laws as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws. This could also include costs of cleaning up chemicals and wastes released into the environment and for damages to persons, properties or natural resources. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate environmental contamination (including contaminated groundwater), and undertake measures to prevent future contamination. We may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances as well as damage to natural resources. We may not be able to recover some or any of these remedial or corrective costs from insurance.
 Environmental laws and regulations, and their interpretation, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time. New, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations could be adopted or implemented that

significantly increase our compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows.
Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
 Our clients in the oil and gas industry are also subject to many of the same laws and regulations relating to environmental protection in the United States and in foreign countries where we operate. In particular, we, our third-party vendors that supply us with goods and services in support of our business, and our clients are subject to an increased governmental and public focus on risks associated with the threat of climate change arising from the emission of greenhouse gases ("GHG"). Our and our clients’ compliance with such existing, or any new or amended legal requirements that are placed into effect and applicable in areas where we or our clients conduct operations, could result in our or our clients’ incurring significant additional expense and operating restrictions. Our costs may not be fully recoverable from our clients and, thus, could reduce net income. To the extent any such existing or future legal requirements result in increased costs or restrictions or cancellation in the operation of our clients, such developments could reduce demand for our products and services and have an indirect material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, we depend on the demand for our products and services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, are affected by changing taxes, price controls, tariffs and trade restrictions, and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, including those specifically directed to hydraulic fracturing, onshore production, air pollution, and climate change.
Access to capital is another risk that may be impacted by climate change policies as shareholders, bondholders and institutional lenders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies or supporting entities such as ours but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors.
Consequently, to the extent one or more of these climate-related events are incurred by us, our third party vendors, or our clients, any of us could incur increased costs, we could incur disruptions to our operations as a result of our vendor's inability to supply us with goods and services, and our clients in particular could elect to delay, restrict or cancel drilling, exploration or production programs, which could reduce demand for our products and services, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
 Climate Related Initiatives
 We are committed to reducing our physical risks and environmental footprint associated with climate change while improving our performance and sustainability in line with the global transition toward lower carbon sources of energy. Core Lab has demonstrated its transparency and accountability vital to tracking progress by disclosing its environmental impact through the Carbon Disclosure Project (a non-profit that runs the world’s leading environmental disclosure platform, “CDP”) annual survey since 2014.
Physical Risk Analysis
 In 2020, Core Lab conducted a physical risk assessment with the aid of a third-party sustainability data company for 100 of our locations to understand the exposure of our facilities and capital assets to climate change physical impacts under future climate change scenarios. Physical risks evaluated were water stress, flooding, heatwave, cold wave, hurricane, wildfire, and sea level rise using three climate scenarios over time periods of 2020 (baseline), 2030 and 2050. Overall, we face moderate physical risk with our greatest exposure to water stress and cold wave. Our overall exposure stays consistent throughout the scenarios, although exposure to cold wave does show decline through the scenarios. These physical risks could result in loss of revenue, increase in our costs, including insurance premiums, or affect the availability of insurance against such risks.
 We do not have locations that are in a natural, rural environment. Before opening a new location, potential impacts to the environment and community are considered by executive management. In the event we close a particular location, we ensure that the land and building are properly returned to a suitable condition. We also take steps to ensure that any potential environmental conditions have been remediated as required by local regulation and standards.
 GHG Emissions


Core Laboratories maintains a sustainability management system that tracks our consumption of non-renewable resources. We also have engaged a third-party sustainability data company to quantify the impact of emissions categorized as:
•Scope 1 (direct GHG emissions that occur from sources that we control or own), 
 •Scope 2 (indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling) or 
 •Scope 3 (indirect emissions that occur upstream or downstream in our value chain)
This system assists us in setting science-based targets for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Science-based targets aim to help companies work towards limiting the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°C, a limit agreed upon by leading climate scientists and governments to ensure long-term sustainability and profitability. These tools focus the Company’s efforts on reducing our environmental footprint and provide the data needed to create other climate targets and goals.
Our operational footprint is primarily from our office buildings and laboratories and their related electricity consumption (Scope 2 emission) and use of natural gas heating (Scope 1 emission). In our efforts to reduce GHG emissions, we choose responsible alternative sources of electricity, such as renewable sources or low-carbon emission natural gas when there are options available. We also consume fuel to operate field vehicles (Scope 1 emission), however, this is limited to our staff working in the field and is not a significant emission component of our total operations. Most of the value chain emissions (Scope 3 emissions) occur upstream from our operations and are from purchased goods and services.
 Occupational Safety and Health Regulations
 Our operations in the United Sates are subject to stringent occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which are intended to protect worker health and safety, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of this information to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) establishes requirements for the safe use and storage of explosives. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. Foreign countries in which we conduct operations may also have analogous controls that regulate our worker safety-related activities, which controls may impose additional, or more stringent requirements. Consistent with our quality assurance and control principles, we have established proactive worker safety policies in the United States and foreign countries, which meet or exceed applicable worker safety legal requirements.
As discussed above, our processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of waste which could cause harm to our employees. Such work is performed in an industrial or laboratory setting, or at our clients’ worksite which would also require travel. These types of conditions are susceptible to workplace accidents.
Historically, our worker safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Competition
 The business in which we engage is competitive. Some of our competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. While no one company competes with us in all of our service and product lines, we face competition in these lines, primarily from independent regional companies and internal divisions of major integrated oil and gas companies. We compete in different service and product lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, availability, quality and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new services and products, performance and quality, client service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.
 Reliance on the Oil and Gas Industry
 Our business and operations are substantially dependent upon the condition of the global oil and gas industry. Future downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business as well as the adoption and implementation of legislation, executive orders, and other regulatory initiatives that seek to combat climate change by restricting fossil fuel activities, limiting GHG emissions, certain methods of extraction of oil and gas, or the locations in which such activities may be conducted, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. This risk factor is

perhaps amplified given recent pronouncements and actions taken by the executive and/or legislative branches of the U.S. government in an uncertain and shifting political environment.
 The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times as a result of numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the level of capital expenditures of the oil and gas industry, the level of drilling activity, the level of production activity, market prices of oil and gas, economic conditions existing in the world, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulations, tax policies, political requirements of national governments, coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC"), cost of producing oil and natural gas, and technological advances.
 The success of our business has been underpinned by developing industry leading technologies used in evaluating and improving reservoir performance, increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields, as well as evaluating potential CCS sites in the subsurface both onshore and offshore. Many of these technologies have been developed to meet the needs of our clients, which continue to evolve with demands in both traditional energy sources and with energy transition. As energy transition continues to evolve, our business may become more dependent on the continued innovation and adoption of our industry leading technologies.
 Human Capital
 We are primarily a service provider in the oilfield services industry, so our workforce includes employees who are highly skilled professionals, including engineers and geologists, and other technical personnel, in addition to our administrative employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 3,600 employees. We do not have any material collective bargaining agreements and consider relations with our employees to be good.
 Our Core Values: (1) Safety Awareness, (2) Honesty & Integrity, (3) Customer Focus, (4) Building Trust and (5) Employee Development, define us as a company and are the framework that unite us on the path toward achieving our goals and propelling Core Lab forward. These values represent and establish the foundation by which we treat each other, conduct our business and simply define “how we do things around here”. By embedding our Core Values into our operating strategies, we ensure that our company culture and mission also drive our Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") sustainability efforts. We keep our employees informed of major business developments through CoreConnect, a communication initiative to drive connection and engagement between employees and executive leadership and through contact by extended leadership teams, periodic emails, quarterly newsletters, quarterly reports, and annual events.
 Core Lab values its employees and is committed to providing resources that engage employees, enhance their work experience, and develop them for the future. To assist in this pledge, Core Lab has created its talent management strategy based on the employee life cycle. To ensure we have a diverse employee population reflective of our communities and client base, we’ve implemented recruiting practices that support and encourage the hiring and retention of diverse talent. Our total rewards approach is aligned to our business strategy and country-specific market influences. We offer competitive compensation and benefit programs in each country where we operate. Our approach not only encompasses competitive compensation and benefits, but also personal and professional growth opportunities within a global performance culture.
We develop our employees through performance management processes, competency-based development plans and training both in leadership and functional areas while also offering educational assistance programs. Recently, we expanded our talent assessment process to identify emerging technical and leadership talent across the Company. Our annual performance management cycle is an ongoing process that enables managers and employees to collaborate throughout the year to set performance goals and development objectives that align to business objectives. This process is designed to help employees understand where they add value to the organization, provide focus on and discussion around career aspirations, and reward employees for high performance.
We aspire to attract a diverse group of employees and create an inclusive work culture where differences are valued. We recognize the unique perspectives and thoughts that all people bring to our environment stimulates innovation and generates out-of-the-box solutions that benefit our employees, clients and industry. We promote a culture-centric focus on the health and safety of our employees and the environment with a pro-active approach towards identifying and managing risks through recognition, evaluation, and education. We empower our employees by fostering a sense of responsibility for managing their own work environment through open communication, and a management-supported “zero accident” culture.
