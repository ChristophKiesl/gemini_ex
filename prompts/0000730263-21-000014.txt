Acquisitions
Fiscal 2021
Tiffin Group
On December 18, 2020, the Company closed on a Stock Purchase Agreement (“Tiffin Group SPA”) for the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of luxury motorized recreational vehicle manufacturer Tiffin Motorhomes, Inc., including fifth wheel towable recreational vehicle manufacturer Vanleigh RV, and certain other associated operating and supply companies, which primarily supply component parts and services to Tiffin Motorhomes, Inc. and Vanleigh RV (collectively, the “Tiffin Group”). Tiffin Group, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns the Tiffin Group. Tiffin Motorhomes, Inc. operates out of various locations in Alabama, while Vanleigh RV operates out of Mississippi.
The initial cash consideration for the acquisition of the Tiffin Group was approximately $300,000, subject to adjustment, and was funded through existing cash-on-hand as well as $165,000 in borrowings from the Company’s existing asset-based credit facility. The total cash consideration to be paid was subject to the final determination of the actual acquired net working capital, as defined in the Tiffin Group SPA, as of the close of business on December 18, 2020, which determination was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the final adjustment was not material. The Tiffin Group operates as an independent operation in the same manner as the Company’s other recreational vehicle subsidiaries. The Tiffin Group's motorized operations are aggregated within the Company’s North American motorized recreational vehicle reportable segment and its towable operations are aggregated within the Company’s North American towable recreational vehicle reportable segment. The Company purchased the Tiffin Group to complement its existing motorized and towable RV product offerings and North American independent dealer base.
Fiscal 2020
Togo Group
In February 2018, the Company formed a 50/50 joint venture, originally called TH2connect, LLC, with Tourism Holdings Limited ("thl"). In July 2019, this joint venture was rebranded as "Togo Group." Togo Group was formed to own, improve and sell innovative and comprehensive digital applications through a platform designed for the global RV industry. Since its formation through March 23, 2020, the Company applied the equity method of accounting to the joint venture.
Effective March 23, 2020 the Company and thl reached an agreement (the “2020 Agreement”) whereby the Company agreed to pay thl $6,000 on August 1, 2020 and, in return, obtained additional ownership interest in Togo Group. In addition, certain assets or rights to assets historically owned by Togo Group were distributed to thl in exchange for a corresponding reduction in thl’s ownership interest in Togo Group. As a result of the 2020 Agreement, THOR has a 73.5% controlling interest in Togo Group and the power to direct the activities of Togo Group. Since the effective date of the 2020 Agreement, the operating results, balance sheet accounts and cash flow activity of Togo Group are consolidated within the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
The operations of Togo Group are focused on digital solutions primarily for the North American market related to travel and RV use, with expansion into other regions anticipated in future periods. Togo Group is managed as a stand-alone operating entity.
Fiscal 2019
Erwin Hymer Group Acquisition
On February 1, 2019, the Company acquired Erwin Hymer Group SE (“EHG” or “Erwin Hymer Group”). EHG is headquartered in Bad Waldsee, Germany, and is one of the largest RV manufacturers in Europe. The Company acquired EHG in order to expand its operations into the established but growing European market with a long-standing European industry leader.
At the closing, the Company paid cash consideration of approximately 1.53 billion Euro (approximately $1.76 billion at the exchange rate as of February 1, 2019) and issued 2,256,492 shares of the Company’s common stock to the sellers valued at $144.2 million. The cash consideration was funded through a combination of available cash on hand of approximately $95 million and debt financing consisting of two credit facility agreements, a seven-year, $2.1 billion term loan, with an approximate $1.4 billion U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and an approximate 0.6 billion Euro tranche (approximately $0.7 billion at the exchange rate at February 1, 2019), and $100 million utilized at closing from a five-year, $750 million asset-based credit facility (“ABL”), each as more fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The obligations of the Company under each facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company, and both agreements contain certain customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company.
Certain costs incurred during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 related to this acquisition, including the foreign currency forward contract loss and certain bank fees, ticking fees, legal, advisory and other costs, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are included in Acquisition-related costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Recreational Vehicles
Overview
We manufacture a wide variety of recreational vehicles in the United States and Europe and sell those vehicles, as well as related parts and accessories, primarily to independent, non-franchise dealers throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. North American recreational vehicle classifications are based upon standards established by the RV Industry Association (“RVIA”). The principal types of recreational vehicles that we produce in North America include conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels as well as Class A, Class C and Class B motorhomes. In Europe, we produce numerous types of towable and motorized recreational vehicles, including caravans, motorcaravans, campervans, urban vehicles and other RV-related products and services.
North American Recreational Vehicles
Travel trailers are non-motorized vehicles which are designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs or vans. Travel trailers provide comfortable, self-contained living facilities for camping, vacationing and other purposes. Within North America we produce “conventional” and “fifth wheel” trailers. Conventional trailers are towed by means of a frame hitch attached to the towing vehicle. Fifth wheel trailers, designed to be towed by pickup trucks, are constructed with a raised forward section that is attached to a receiver in the bed area of the pickup truck.
A motorhome is a self-powered vehicle built on a motor vehicle chassis. Motorhomes are self-contained with their own lighting, heating, cooking, refrigeration, sewage holding and water storage facilities, so that they can be utilized without being attached to utilities.
Within North America, Class A motorhomes, generally constructed on medium-duty truck chassis, are supplied complete with engine and drivetrain components by motor vehicle manufacturers such as Ford, Freightliner and The Shyft Group. We design, manufacture and install the living area and driver’s compartment of Class A motorhomes. Class C and Class B motorhomes are generally built on a Ford, General Motors or Mercedes-Benz small truck or van chassis, which includes an engine, drivetrain components and a finished cab section. We construct a living area which has access to the driver’s compartment and attaches to the cab section. Although they are not designed for permanent or semi-permanent living, motorhomes can provide comfortable living facilities for camping, vacationing and other purposes.
European Recreational Vehicles
In Europe, a caravan is a travel trailer which is a non-motorized vehicle designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, SUVs or vans. Caravans provide comfortable, self-contained living facilities for camping, vacationing and other purposes. In Europe, the focus is on light and small caravans that can even be towed by small passenger cars.
Motorcaravans are similar to the Class A and Class C motorized products in the North American market. Motorcaravans include various types, such as, integrated, semi-integrated and alcove, and are generally constructed on light duty truck chassis, supplied complete with engine and drivetrain components by chassis manufacturers such as Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and Iveco. The main difference between European motorcaravans as compared to RVs in the North American market is that the focus in Europe is on lighter and smaller vehicles due to weight restrictions and driving license requirements.
An integrated motorcaravan contains driving and passenger space that is completely integrated into the vehicle, along with the living area, which creates a great feeling of openness. The driver/passenger and living areas are made of one compartment and form a single unit.
A semi-integrated motorcaravan is one whose cab (driver/passenger compartment) belongs to the chassis. This means that the existing driver/passenger area is complemented by an attached living area. As a result, the advantages of the basic vehicle are enhanced by mobile living.
An alcove motorcaravan is one where there is an additional sleeping space located above the driver’s cab. This superstructure is called an “alcove” and it comprises sleeping accommodations for two people. Behind the driver’s cab is an additional bedroom and a living space with basic equipment.
A campervan is comparable to the Class B motorhome in the North American market. They are generally built on a Stellantis or Mercedes-Benz panel van chassis which includes an engine, drivetrain components and a finished cab section. A constructed living area provides access to the driver’s compartment and attaches to the cab section. As they are smaller and more compact than typical motorhomes, a campervan has the advantage of being easier to maneuver and easier to park.
An urban vehicle is a multi-functional vehicle, similar to a minivan, that is mainly used as a family car but has a small removable kitchen and sitting area that can be converted into a sleeping area. Additionally, these vehicles are equipped with a pop-up roof to provide additional sleeping quarters.
Production
In order to minimize finished inventory, our recreational vehicles in both North America and Europe are generally produced to dealer order. Our facilities are designed to provide efficient assembly-line manufacturing of products. In North America and Europe, capacity increases can generally be achieved relatively quickly and at relatively low cost, largely by acquiring, leasing, or building additional facilities and equipment and increasing the number of production employees. In North America, capacity decreases can generally be achieved relatively quickly and at relatively low cost, mainly by decreasing the number of production employees. In Europe, short-term capacity decreases can generally be achieved by adjusting work schedules and reducing the number of contract and temporary workers.
We purchase many of the components used in the production of our recreational vehicles in finished form. The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for motorhomes, including motorcaravans, campervans and urban vehicles, and travel trailers, including caravans, are chassis, aluminum, lumber, plywood, plastic, fiberglass and steel purchased from numerous suppliers.
Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other RV vendor relationships in that no long-term contractual commitments are entered into by either party. Historically, chassis manufacturers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when chassis supply is restricted. These allocations are generally based on the volume of chassis previously purchased. While we are not dependent on any one supplier, we do depend on a consistent supply of chassis from a limited number of chassis suppliers. Sales of motorhomes rely on these chassis. 
Recently, we have been alerted by a number of our North American and European chassis suppliers that supply constraints of key components that they require for the manufacturing of chassis, particularly semiconductor chips, will limit their production of chassis, and hence, our production and sales of motorized RVs will also be impacted. The North American and European recreational vehicle industries have, from time to time in the past and during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, experienced shortages of chassis for various other reasons, including component shortages, production delays and work stoppages at the chassis manufacturers. If shortages of chassis were to recur or continue for a prolonged period for any reason, it would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
The North American and European RV industries are also facing continuing supply shortages or delivery delays of other, non-chassis, raw material components. While our supply chain has been resilient enough to support us during our recent growth in sales and production, these shortages and constraints have negatively impacted our ability to further ramp up production rates and sales during the current fiscal year and has caused an increase in unfinished units as of July 31, 2021. We believe these shortages and delays may continue to result in production delays or adjusted production rates, which may limit our ability to ramp up production to meet existing demand and could have a negative impact on our sales and earnings. If shortages of chassis or other component parts were to become more significant or longer term in nature, or if other factors were to impact our suppliers' ability to fully supply our needs for key components, our costs of such components and our production output could be adversely affected. Where possible, we continue to work closely with our suppliers on various supply chain strategies to minimize these constraints, and we continue to identify alternative suppliers. 
The geographic centrality of the North American RV industry in northern Indiana, where the majority of our facilities and many of our suppliers are located, could exacerbate supply chain and other COVID-19 related risks, should northern Indiana, or any of the other areas in which we, our suppliers or our customers operate, become disproportionately impacted by the pandemic or other factors.
This situation is fluid, with the items experiencing shortages changing frequently as disruptions caused by COVID-19 and other events are impacting the entire supply chain as well as the transportation of those items. If the supply constraints become more significant, longer term in nature or are not limited in scope; if industry demand continues to increase faster than the suppliers can respond; or if other factors were to impact the suppliers’ ability to supply our production needs, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are continuing to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these supply constraints and delays on our production and sales.
Generally, our North American and European RV operating subsidiaries introduce new or improved lines or models of recreational vehicles each year. Changes typically include new sizes and floor plans, different decors or design features and engineering and technological improvements.
Seasonality
Historically, since recreational vehicles were used primarily by vacationers and campers, our recreational vehicle sales tended to be seasonal and, in most geographical areas, tended to be lower during the winter months than in other periods. As a result, our recreational vehicle sales were historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends on January 31 of each year. However, industry wholesale shipments in calendar 2021 and beyond may not follow typical historical seasonal patterns as dealers adjust their inventory to the current increased demand by consumers. 
Marketing and Distribution
We sell our recreational vehicles primarily to independent, non-franchise dealers located throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. Each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries sell to their own network of independent dealers, with many dealers carrying more than one of our product lines, as well as products from other manufacturers. As of July 31, 2021, there were approximately 2,400 independent, non-franchise dealership locations carrying our products in the U.S. and Canada and approximately 1,100 dealership locations, of which two are Company-owned, carrying our products throughout Europe. We believe that the working relationships between the management and sales personnel of our operating entities and the independent dealers provide us with valuable information on customer preferences and the quality and marketability of our products.
Our European brands distribute their vehicles in Europe through dealer networks that offer various EHG brands covering all price segments in each region, avoiding brand overlap even in regions with two or more dealers that offer EHG brands. The European dealer base is comprised primarily of independent dealers, although EHG does operate two Company-owned dealerships. Approximately 40% of the independent European dealers sell EHG brands exclusively.
Each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries has an independent wholesale sales force that works directly with dealers. Typically, there are wholesale shows held during the year in certain locations within the United States and Europe. These shows allow dealers to view new and existing products as well as place orders. Due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic concerns and efforts to limit its spread, we anticipate certain wholesale shows may be eliminated or scaled back for at least the remainder of calendar 2021. Based on our backlog as of July 31, 2021, we do not believe that the lack of these wholesale shows will have a material, negative impact to our near-term results of operations. 
Historically, the most important retail sales events occur at various consumer recreational vehicle shows or trade fairs which take place throughout the year at different locations across the United States, Canada and Europe. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing efforts to limit its spread, most retail show sponsors and dealers cancelled these shows in calendar 2020 and early calendar 2021, and may continue to do so for at least the near-term future. We do not expect the lack of these shows to have a negative impact on our results of operations in the near-term due to current consumer demand and increased digital marketing activities, by both our operating units and the dealers of our units. We also benefit in the United States from the recreational vehicle awareness advertising and marketing programs sponsored by the RVIA in national print media and television. 
In our selection of individual, independent dealers, we emphasize the dealer’s ability to maintain a sufficient inventory of our products, as well as their financial stability, credit worthiness, reputation, experience and ability to provide service to the end customer. Many dealers, particularly in North America, carry the recreational vehicle lines of one or more of our competitors. Generally, each of our recreational vehicle operating subsidiaries have separate dealer agreements.
One dealer, FreedomRoads, LLC, accounted for approximately 13.0% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 and for approximately 15.0% and 18.5% in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. This dealer also accounted for approximately 15% of the Company’s consolidated trade accounts receivable at July 31, 2021 and approximately 18% at July 31, 2020.
We generally do not finance dealer purchases. Most dealers are financed on a “floor plan” basis by an unrelated bank or financing company, which lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price and retains a security interest in the vehicles purchased. As is customary in the recreational vehicle industry, we will generally execute a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer’s purchase of our products upon the lending institution’s request. Repurchase agreements provide that, typically for a period of up to 18 months after a unit is financed and in the event of default by the dealer and notification from the lending institution of the dealer default, we will repurchase all of the applicable or qualifying dealer units repossessed by the lending institution for the amount then due, which is often less than 100% of the dealer’s cost. The risk of loss under repurchase agreements is spread over numerous dealers and is further reduced by the resale value of the units which we would be required to repurchase. Based on current conditions, we believe that future losses under these agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our Company. The Company’s total commercial commitments under standby repurchase obligations on dealer inventory financing as of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 were $1,821,012 and $1,876,922, respectively. The losses incurred due to repurchase were not material in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Backlog
The backlogs for our North American towable, North American motorized and European recreational vehicle segments as of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, respectively, were as follows.

 | July 31, 2021 | | July 31, 2020 | | ChangeAmount | | %Change 
Recreational vehicles | | | | | | | 
North American Towables | $ | 9,284,229 | | | $ | 2,763,678 | | $ | 6,520,551 | 235.9
North American Motorized | 4,014,738 | | | 1,451,641 | | | 2,563,097 | | 176.6 
Total North America | 13,298,967 | | | 4,215,319 | | | 9,083,648 | | 215.5 
European | 3,559,097 | | | 1,525,973 | | | 2,033,124 | | 133.2 
Total | $ | 16,858,064 | | | $ | 5,741,292 | | $ | 11,116,772 | 193.6

We believe this increase is attributable to a number of causes, including the perceived safety of RV travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, a strong desire to socially distance, the reduction in commercial air travel and cruises, an underlying desire by many to get back to nature and relax with family or friends, an increase in various marketing campaigns to promote sales, and to a lesser extent, supply chain issues which delayed certain shipments beyond July 31, 2021 and which prevented us from further increasing production rates, and the lower levels of independent North American and European RV dealer inventory levels, all of which have led to increased dealer orders and backlog. Tiffin Group's backlog included in the July 31, 2021 totals accounted for $767,036 of the $11,116,772 increase and for 13.4% of the 193.6% increase. 
Backlog represents unfilled dealer orders on a particular day which can and do fluctuate on a seasonal basis. The manufacturing time in the recreational vehicle business is relatively short. Barring any significant and longer-term material supply constraints, the existing backlogs of the North American towable, North American motorized and European recreational vehicle segments are expected to be filled in calendar 2021 and calendar 2022.
Product Warranties
In North America, we generally provide retail purchasers of our recreational vehicles with a one-year or two-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship with longer warranties on certain structural components. In Europe, we generally offer a two-year limited warranty on certain structural components and up to a 12-year warranty against water leakage. The chassis and engines in all of our motorhomes are generally warranted for various periods in excess of one year by their manufacturers.
Regulation
In the countries where we operate and our products are sold, we are subject to various vehicle safety and compliance standards. Within the United States, we are a member of the RVIA, a voluntary association of recreational vehicle manufacturers which promulgates recreational vehicle safety standards in the United States. We place an RVIA seal on each of our North American recreational vehicles to certify that the RVIA’s standards have been met. We also comply with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) in the U.S. and with similar standards within Canada and Europe as it relates to the safety of our products.
Governmental authorities in the regions in which we operate have various environmental control standards relating to air, water and noise pollution which affect our business and operations. For example, these standards, which are generally applicable to all companies, control our choice of paints, our air compressor discharge, our waste water and the noise emitted by our factories. We rely upon certifications obtained by chassis manufacturers with respect to compliance by our vehicles with applicable emission control standards.
Our plants are subject to and are periodically inspected by various governmental and industry agencies concerned with health and safety in the workplace to ensure that our plants and products comply with applicable governmental and industry standards. We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable vehicle safety (including those promulgated by NHTSA), environmental, industry, health, safety and other required regulations.
We do not believe that ongoing compliance with the existing regulations discussed above will have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, future developments in regulation and/or policy could impose significant challenges upon our business operations.
Competition
The recreational vehicle industry is generally characterized by low barriers to entry. The recreational vehicle market is intensely competitive, with numerous other manufacturers selling products that compete directly with our products. We also compete against consumer demand for used recreational vehicles, particularly during periods of economic downturn, and against other forms of consumer leisure, outdoor or vacation spending priorities. We also experience a certain level of competition between our own operating subsidiaries. Increased activity in the market for used recreational vehicles may also impact manufacturers’ sales of new products. Competition in the recreational vehicle industry is based upon price, design, value, quality and service. We believe that the price, design, value and quality of our products and the warranty coverage and service that we provide allow us to compete favorably for retail purchasers of recreational vehicles and consumer leisure spending. There are approximately 70 RV manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada, according to RVIA and approximately 30 RV manufacturers across Europe according to Caravaning Industry Association e.V. (“CIVD”).
Our primary RV competitors within the North American towable and motorized segments are Forest River, Inc. and Winnebago Industries, Inc. We are the largest recreational vehicle manufacturer in North America in terms of both units sold and revenue. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., for the six months ended June 30, 2021, THOR’s current combined U.S. and Canadian market share based on unit retail sales was approximately 41.9% for travel trailers and fifth wheels combined and approximately 47.5% for motorhomes.
Our primary RV competitors within the European segment are Trigano, Hobby/Fendt, Knaus Tabbert and various vehicle manufacturers. EHG’s current European market share for the six months ended June 30, 2021 based on unit retail sales was approximately 24.5% for motorcaravans and campervans combined and approximately 17.5% for caravans.
Trademarks and Patents
We have registered United States trademarks, Canadian trademarks, German trademarks and certain other international trademarks and licenses carrying the principal trade names and model lines under which our products are marketed. We hold and protect certain patents related to our business. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business.
Human Capital Resources
Since our founding in 1980, we have been dedicated to our key principles of operating fairly and ethically, with stewardship and transparency, under our core values of community, compassion, trustworthiness and adventure. We believe in the invigorating power of human connection and commit to our team members by teaching our leaders how to nurture, guide and foster strong relationships with them. We treat others with dignity and respect, practicing thankfulness and gratitude. We strive to operate in a way that our word is trusted, and we are committed to providing a safe work environment for our team members while empowering them to seize opportunities around them and give them avenues to grow and learn. 
At July 31, 2021, we employed approximately 31,000 full-time employees worldwide, including approximately 22,000 full-time employees in the United States, of which approximately 2,500 were salaried, and approximately 9,000 full-time employees in Europe, of which approximately 2,300 were salaried. As of July 31, 2021, none of our North American employees were represented by certified labor organizations. Within our European-based operations, we are subject to employee contracts, Works Councils and certain labor organizations. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees.
Our Company and operating subsidiaries share a global commitment to all of our stakeholders to foster an inclusive workplace where dignity and respect for team members are encouraged and where each team member is supported to achieve their maximum potential. We believe that the performance of our Company is significantly impacted by our human capital management, and, as a result, we consistently strive to attract, select, engage, develop and retain strong, diverse talent as summarized below.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
THOR is made up of a number of subsidiaries located in various regions within the United States and Europe, each of which operates independently with its own unique culture. As such, compensation and benefits are tailored to meet the specific needs and expectations of the employees at each of our subsidiaries with the goal of attracting and retaining the best talent. At all subsidiaries, we offer competitive pay, health insurance plans, company-paid life insurance and paid-time off. Other benefits offered include a pay-for-performance bonus structure, group and individual life insurance and plans to assist our employees for their retirement.
Team Member Safety and Wellness 
THOR is committed to the health and safety of every team member. We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries, supported by effective communication, reporting and external benchmarking. Within each of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, in both North America and Europe, we have site-specific safety and environmental plans designed to reduce risk. All of our sites follow safety laws and regulations, and all accidents, injuries or unsafe equipment, practices, or conditions are required to be reported immediately and are reviewed to determine if additional safety measures are warranted. 
The health and wellness of our employees are top priorities for THOR. Our Corporate office and subsidiaries offer standard medical, vision and dental programs as well as various programs to further address the needs of our employees. For example, all THOR North American team members have access to the Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") where they can receive up to five free sessions to assist with counseling needs, personal and/or work related concerns. Our EAP services are designed to help provide support for team members who are navigating life issues. 
Our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic further illustrates our commitment to the health, wellness and safety of our team members. To support our employees, communities and other stakeholders, we make employee safety our top priority, following protocols that align with governmental authorities and health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout fiscal year 2021, THOR has taken numerous, stringent companywide measures to protect our workforce from COVID-19, including the following: 
•Implementing robust, consistent cleaning and disinfecting protocols;
•Providing testing locations, free of charge, to team members;
•Requiring team members to stay home, with no actual or implied penalties, if they are feeling ill; 
•Restricting onsite visitors and eliminating company tours;
•Restricting or, in many cases, eliminating employee work-related travel;
•Updating our protocols and procedures, as needed, when new information becomes available; and
•Implementing detailed contact tracing procedures for those who may have been exposed.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I")
We strive to have an inclusive culture and diverse workforce, reflective of the communities in which our individual operating companies are located. We believe attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees will enable us to be more innovative and responsive to consumer needs and deliver strong sustained performance and growth. In fiscal year 2021, our Corporate office DE&I Committee focused on three main areas of Recruitment, Culture and Community Partnerships. These initiatives were identified to strengthen our inclusive culture by identifying innovative ways to attract talent, creating an inclusive corporate workplace and focusing on building strong partnerships with organizations in our community who serve diverse populations. 
At THOR, we are committed to: 
•Inspiring an inclusive culture which embraces individual differences; 
•Treating team members fairly and with respect; 
•Establishing a workplace free from discrimination and harassment; 
•Training team members to be aware of their rights and responsibilities in regards to fair treatment; and 
•Providing equal opportunities based on ability, performance and potential.
Commitment to Ethical Behavior
Each year, THOR conducts training with certain employees, based on their role and level in the organization, on its business ethics policy. Providing our team members with resources to help make good decisions through an ethics program cultivates strong teamwork and productivity. Issues can be communicated anonymously using our multilingual third-party hotline via phone, email or online inquiry systems. Every report is investigated and, if warranted, corrective actions are taken or implemented. THOR protects team members, who report issues, from any retaliation.
