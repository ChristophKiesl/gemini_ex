ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

SharpSpring, Inc. (the “Company”) is a cloud-based marketing technology company. The SharpSpring platform is designed to improve the way that businesses communicate with their prospects and customers to increase sales. The Company’s flagship Marketing Automation platform uses advanced features such as web tracking, lead scoring and automated workflow to help businesses deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. The SharpSpring platform is designed and built as a Software as Service (or SaaS) offering. We provide our products on a subscription basis, with additional fees charged if specified volume limits are exceeded by our customers. 

The Company’s Perfect Audience platform expands our product and service offering into advertisement retargeting for small businesses. The Perfect Audience platform employs a usage-based revenue model. Revenue from this platform is dependent on the number of ads placed through the platform and the effectiveness of that ad space.

We operate globally through SharpSpring, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and our wholly owned subsidiaries that consist of (i) SharpSpring Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation; (ii) SharpSpring Reach, Inc., a Delaware corporation; (iii) InterInbox SA, a Swiss corporation; (iv) ERNEPH 2012A (Pty) Ltd., a South African limited company; (v) ERNEPH 2012B (Pty) Ltd., a South African limited company; and (vi) SMTP Holdings S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg S.a.r.l. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” and other similar terms means SharpSpring, Inc., and its subsidiaries.

Markets & Competition

Our SharpSpring products compete primarily in the marketing automation, revenue growth, and advertisement retargeting markets. The market for marketing automation software and related solutions is evolving and highly competitive with expected competition to increase as barriers decrease as does complexity of the technology decreases. SharpSpring entered the market in 2014 with a highly competitive offering that achieved meaningful customer adoption in its first few years after launch. As of December 31, 2020, the SharpSpring platforms collectively had over 3,500 paying customers and over 10,000 businesses using the platform, including agencies, agency clients, and direct end-user customers. 

SharpSpring

We face competition from cloud-based software and SaaS companies, including HubSpot, Act-On, Pardot (part of Salesforce.com), and ActiveCampaign for our flagship Marketing Automation platform. We differentiate ourselves from the competition with the integration of specific tools designed for digital marketing agencies, and with SharpSpring’s advanced features, ease of use, platform flexibility, and value compared to other competitive offerings. SharpSpring is designed as a solution for small or mid-sized businesses but focuses on selling to marketing agencies, who serve as partners providing a distribution channel to their clients.

The majority of SharpSpring customers are digital marketing agencies. A digital marketing agency is a firm that specializes in helping clients, usually small or mid-sized businesses, with their digital marketing initiatives like websites, email marketing, search engine optimization, social campaigns, pay-per-click advertising and other digital lead generation activities. We have built special tools in the SharpSpring application to allow agencies to manage their clients on the platform and optimize their efforts across their portfolio. We also have special pricing to agency customers to allow them the flexibility to resell the platform at a profit and manage their client relationships. In general, when we sell SharpSpring to an agency customer, we provide the agency with a SharpSpring license for the agency to use, plus a 3-pack of client licenses for the agency to deploy to their client base. This agency license and the pack of licenses are generally sold for a monthly recurring fee, plus an up-front onboarding fee. The agency has complete discretion over the pricing of the platform to their clients for the use, implementation, and services related to SharpSpring. If an agency utilizes its pack of licenses and adds additional clients on to the platform, there is a monthly per-client fee charged to the agency based on the number of additional licenses the agency has deployed to their clients. Additionally, we charge customers for certain items if the volume or transactional limits are exceeded, such as emails sent, or contacts stored in the platform. In most cases, we provide support to the agency and the agency provides support to their clients on the platform. However, for additional fees, we can provide product support to the agency’s client directly. Our objective is to partner with the agencies to grow and expand our businesses together using the SharpSpring platform. 

Approximately one-fifth of our Marketing Automation customers are individual businesses that have licensed SharpSpring directly without working through an agency. We refer to these customers as “Direct Customers.” Similar to agency customers, Direct Customers pay a monthly subscription fee for the use of the platform, plus an up-front onboarding fee. Additionally, we charge Direct Customers additional transactional charges based on usage over certain limits.

SharpSpring Mail+

SharpSpring Mail+ provides customers with an advanced email marketing and marketing automation tool. It includes traditional email campaign management solutions like design capabilities, reporting tools and list management functionality, but also includes additional features like dynamic email content and SharpSpring’s visitor ID tool that are more typically found in a marketing automation solution. SharpSpring Mail+ competes with companies such as Constant Contact, iContact Corporation, The Rocket Science Group, LLC (MailChimp®), and VerticalResponse, Inc., a subsidiary of Deluxe Corporation, as well as other email and marketing automation companies. SharpSpring Mail+, and most other vendors, typically charge a monthly fee or a fee per number of emails sent and, in some cases, they have a free offering for low-volume or non-profit customers. SharpSpring Mail+’s rich feature set is the primary key market differentiator.

Perfect Audience

The Perfect Audience platform was acquired in November of 2019 to enhance the Company’s product and service offering. The Perfect Audience cloud-based platform enables multi-channel retargeting to known leads, plus targeted advertising to new prospects via lookalike audience functionality. It empowers marketers to create, manage, and optimize their ad campaigns across thousands of sites all within one, simple-to-use interface. Perfect Audience adds powerful lead functionality that fuels top-of-the-funnel lead generation efforts, plus additional lead nurturing capabilities to maximize middle-of-the-funnel conversion. These features complement SharpSpring’s core feature set designed to track, nurture, and convert those leads into sales. 

We are part of a continually evolving and highly competitive marketplace. Most of our competitors have more extensive customer bases, broader customer relationships, longer operating histories, and greater name recognition than we have. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services. We face competition from AdRoll, Criteo, Facebook, Google, and The Trade Desk, as well as other online advertising companies. Barriers to entry exist in the advertising retargeting market due to complexity of systems but are decreasing as technology complexity decreases. 

Sales and Marketing

We sell our products globally, through our internal sales teams, and to a lesser extent, third party resellers. We use and rely on our own SharpSpring Marketing Automation platform to help our business generate leads, convert more leads to sales and monitor the effectiveness of all our marketing campaigns. Our website www.sharpspring.com serves as a lead generation source and we use a variety of other digital marketing tools and marketing campaigns to attract new customers.

Our SharpSpring product sales process involves targeting customers, completing product demos, and advancing customers through our marketing and sales pipeline to conversion using our SharpSpring Marketing Automation product. Since SharpSpring was launched fairly recently in 2014, brand recognition today is growing, but still fairly limited. Therefore, we are more reliant on our marketing campaigns and search engine traffic to attract potential leads. Nearly all of our marketing efforts to date have been focused on digital marketing agencies, and as of December 31, 2020 we have approximately 2,000 marketing agency partners. These agencies become customers and are able to resell SharpSpring to their clients, while paying increased fees to us as their client count expands beyond the base license pack. This allows the agency to provide services and first-level support for their clients, which increases their own revenues from the end client and creates a longer-lasting relationship overall between the agency and client. We also sell SharpSpring directly to end-users and have over 500 direct end user customers on the platform. The Company’s sales are done primarily through internal resources, but a small number of third-party resellers were also used during 2020.

The SharpSpring Mail+ product was created in 2016 to migrate GraphicMail customers to the SharpSpring platform. Since that time, we spent limited resources marketing and selling SharpSpring Mail+ as a standalone product and we discontinued its sale to new customers during early 2018. We currently intend to continue supporting SharpSpring Mail+, but may decide to discontinue the SharpSpring Mail+ product altogether in the future. 

Customers

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,500 customers for our SharpSpring product, the majority of which were marketing agencies who resell SharpSpring to their clients. 

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 600 customers using our SharpSpring Mail+ product. 

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 600 customers using our Perfect Audience platform. 

The vast majority of our SharpSpring Marketing Automation customers are on month-to-month agreements and are generally charged in arrears. We have a small number of customers that prepay for longer periods, such as quarterly or annually. Perfect Audience customers generally are on month-to-month agreements and pay a deposit in advance of the service being provided. They are subsequently charged for usage of the platform at the time of use.

Perfect Audience is separate standalone platform that provides multi-channel retargeting to known leads, plus targeted advertising to new prospects via lookalike audience functionality. It empowers marketers to create, manage, and optimize their ad campaigns across thousands of sites using Google, Facebook, Instagram, leading ad exchanges and partner networks. Ads placed via the platform can be seamlessly dispersed and measured across every major advertising network, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, AppNexus, Rubicon, Xandr, and Smaato, providing the tools marketers need to drive incremental leads and sales, while tracking the ROI of their ad spend. With multiple ad networks at their disposal, users can select the best channels for their business’ needs. 

Our platforms are hosted in third party data centers on virtual cloud-based infrastructure. During 2020, these providers included Google Compute and Amazon Web Services. These data centers use a mixture of biometric access controls, redundant power, environmental controls and secure internet connection points to ensure uptime and data security. Email sending technology is a key part of the application, and we rely on a third party to deliver our platform’s email. We monitor our services for availability, performance and security. We rely on our data center and service providers to maintain peak operating conditions in their businesses and to quickly address issues related to their service as they arise. 

Key Performance Indicators

In addition to financial performance, we measure the performance of several key performance indicators, including:


· | Customer acquisition costs (CAC)

Human Capital Management 

Our people are what makes SharpSpring not only a successful company, but also a great place to work. We are motivated by doing great things with great people to achieve a common goal of providing value to our customers through the power of marketing automation. Helping our thousands of customers grow their business is made possible by our employees continually improving each and every part of what we do.

As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 250 full-time employees located in the United States supporting our operations. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

We provide competitive compensation and benefits for our employees across the United States. Our compensation packages may include base salary, commission or quarterly bonuses, and stock-based compensation. We also offer a generous benefits package which includes medical, vision, and dental plans, four weeks of paid time off, life and disability insurance, and a 401(k) matching contributions program designed to provide employee benefits competitive with those offered by our peers and other companies with which we compete for talent. We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings to ensure competitiveness and make adjustments as needed. 

SharpSpring is a diverse and inclusive work environment that promotes partnership in and outside of the office. We believe our Company culture fosters a sense of family that allows us to attract and retain the best talent, which is critical to our continued success. We embrace teamwork and investing in each other’s success, rewarding employees for their hard work and dedication. We take pride in our employees communicating openly, providing the highest level of customer support, developing a product that creates value for our customers, being a leading-edge workplace with a small-town feel, and giving back to our community. SharpSpring has launched various initiatives to ensure our entire staff feels respected and included regardless of their background. Every quarter we ask our employees to complete an employee engagement survey, which covers overall employee morale, team dynamics, work from home, and other topics to ensure our employees are staying engaged and are supported to the best of our abilities. Our most recent survey results showed that the vast majority of our employees feel supported, valued, and have the resources they need to be successful in their career. 

In an effort to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, during the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a fully remote workforce in March of 2020, and we continue to successfully operate in a remote environment today until we can safely return to our office. Even once it is safe to return to the office, SharpSpring will allow employees to work remotely, from our corporate headquarters, or a hybrid of the two options. At the onset of COVID we were unsure what lay ahead for not only our Company, but the global economy. As such we asked staff to take temporary take a pay cut, with executives taking deeper cuts, as well as temporarily pausing our Company bonus and 401(k) Company match program. Full salaries and bonuses for all employees were restored in November of 2020. The 401(k) Company match program was restored in March of 2021.
