ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 
We are a pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and markets innovative anti-infective products for a multitude of uses. However, we are predominantly focused on commercializing prescription Avenova® for the domestic eye care market in the United States.
 
 Avenova is the only eye care product formulated with our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid (marketed as Neutrox®). By replicating the antimicrobial chemicals used by white blood cells to fight infection, Avenova has proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties. It removes microorganisms and debris from the skin on the eyelids and lashes without burning or stinging. It is also the only commercial product clinically validated to reduce bacterial load on the ocular skin surface, the buildup of which can cause the chronic eye condition blepharitis.
 
 In November 2015, we introduced a new business strategy to restructure our business and focus on growing sales of Avenova in the United States.  This new strategy allowed us to achieve our goal of reaching adjusted positive cash flow from operations (excluding working capital changes) by the end of 2016. Our current three-part business strategy is comprised of: (1) focusing our resources on growing the commercial sales of Avenova in the U.S. eye care market, including the implementation of an innovative sales and marketing strategy to increase product margin and profitability; (2) significantly reducing expenses through the restructuring of our operations and other cost reduction measures; and (3) seeking additional sources of revenue through partnering, divesting and/or other means of monetizing non-core assets in urology, dermatology, and wound care.
 
 In addition to Avenova, we have also developed other commercial products containing Neutrox, including NeutroPhase® for the wound care market and CelleRx for the dermatology market. We have partnerships for NeutroPhase in the U.S., as well as select overseas markets, most notably China.
 
Avenova
 
Based on positive sales performance in 2015, we incrementally grew our salesforce to 49 medical sales representatives in 2016 and to 55 in January 2017. Having previously been managed through a professional employer organization, we transitioned our contract salesforce to direct employees of the Company in January 2017. This marked an important milestone in establishing ourselves as a truly consolidated company under the direction of one management team. We believe we are poised for success with all our sales representatives having extensive experience with eye care products and medical devices, a skill set critical for rapid adoption of Avenova in the marketplace.

We currently believe our target market to be the estimated 30 million Americans who suffer from blepharitis and chronic dry-eye. To access our target market, our salesforce is calling on a base of prescribers that includes the approximately 17,000 ophthalmologists and approximately 37,000 optometrists in the U.S. Our sales and marketing campaign targets major urban areas such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco.
 
 Avenova offers distinct advantages, when compared to alternative regimens that contain soaps, bleach, and other impurities, as it removes unwanted microorganisms from the skin without the use of harmful ingredients such as detergents and bleach.  The removal of these harmful items helps control eyelid inflammation, itching and other painful symptoms. Many key opinion leaders in the field of ophthalmology and optometry have embraced Avenova as a tool in the management of lid and lash hygiene and have joined our Ophthalmic and Optometry Advisory Boards (the “Advisory Boards”) to promote its use among their peers. Our Advisory Board members are essential in our goal of educating other physicians that Avenova, used twice daily, is well suited for treating a variety of chronic eye conditions.
 
 Because prescription Avenova has been shown to neutralize bacterial toxins in vitro, it was specifically designed for daily eyelid hygiene. It is the only commercially available product to be clinically validated in a multicenter study to significantly reduce the bacteria that can cause blepharitis.  Data from the clinical study showed that Avenova reduced the bacterial load on ocular skin surface by more than 90% (S. epidermidis by 99.5%) within 20 minutes of use without affecting the diversity of the remaining bacteria.  Results of this clinical study were presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (“ARVO”) annual meeting in May 2016. We expect to present data from additional clinical studies to further validate the use of Avenova in managing blepharitis and other eye conditions. Avenova may also be useful in pre- and post-surgical settings for LASIK and cataract patients, as well as managing contact lens intolerance. We believe the total potential market for this product is approximately 41 million patients.
 
We expect continued benefit from the support of the key opinion leaders on the Advisory Board, our active schedule of educational and marketing programs and strong presence at major eye care conferences in the coming months, including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Optometric Association, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Conferences and the South-Eastern Congress of Optometry, as well as numerous Vision Expo meetings held around the U.S. We also plan to continue advertising in leading ophthalmic and optometric trade journals. At these meetings, in professional publications, and in surveys, nationally prominent ophthalmologists and optometrists are reporting on patient improvements in eye care from the use of Avenova.
 
We have distribution agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen Corporation that make Avenova accessible in 90% of the approximate 67,000 retail pharmacies across the U.S. Avenova also is marketed through the top ophthalmology and optometry networks. These include the Vision Source Independent Optometry Network, the largest independent optometry network in the U.S. representing 2,800 independent optometrist offices, and ALLDocs Optometry Group (also known as The Association of LensCrafters Leaseholding Doctors), the second largest independent optometry group in the U.S., which works closely with its LensCrafters partners.
 
Throughout 2016 we reported increases in key metrics, including the total number of prescribers, as well as growth in prescription volume as reported by distributors and the number of retail pharmacies ordering Avenova, both of which have been confirmed by third-party prescription data providers. Increases in Avenova volume include growth of Avenova product reorders and new prescriptions.
 
We expect that our prescription business will be the main driver of long-term Avenova sales growth and gross margin expansion.  We are focusing our primary sales efforts on building our prescription business under a value pricing model. Our strategy is supported by the high percentage rate of insurance reimbursement, with over 90% of Avenova prescriptions filled at pharmacies covered by insurance at the end of 2016. As a result of this focus, we have significantly increased the percentage of total Avenova prescriptions. We are working to improve insurance reimbursement coverage for Avenova and we are aligning our product pricing accordingly.
 
We also expect to invest in systems that support prescribing physicians’ efforts to educate their patients. We have made it easy for doctors to get Avenova into the hands of patients by providing availability through well-known national pharmacy chains, specialty pharmacies, or directly through the practitioners’ office. Furthermore, in order to ensure consistent pricing, we have instituted rebate cards to ensure the best price for the patient at the pharmacy. This method, combined with reimbursement under insurance plans, could provide us with potential additional revenue upside.

   Competition
 
There are many companies that sell lid and lash scrubs, most of these are surfactant (soap) based, such as lid scrubs or baby shampoos. Unlike its competitors, Avenova consists of saline and 0.01% pure hypochlorous acid, without the bleach impurities included in competitive offerings. While newer prescription products have recently been commercially launched, they all include bleach or other impurities. Because it lacks these impurities, we believe that physicians and their patients will choose Avenova over other competitive prescription products or over-the-counter (“OTC”) soap products.
Strategic Alternatives and Other Assets
 
The third key aspect of our business strategy is to seek additional sources of revenue through partnering, divesting and/or other means of monetizing non-core assets. We therefore are in the process of seeking additional sources of revenue by licensing or selling select non-core assets in urology, dermatology, and wound care, as described in more detail below.
Aganocide Compounds
 
 In addition to our Neutrox family of products, we have synthesized and developed a second category of novel compounds also aimed at harnessing the power of white blood cell chemistry to address the global, topical anti-infective market. This second product category includes auriclosene, our lead clinical-stage Aganocide compound, which is a patented, synthetic molecule with a broad spectrum of uses against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Mimicking the anti-infective chemistry and mechanism of action that human white blood cells use against infections, Aganocides possess a significantly reduced likelihood of bacteria or viruses developing resistance, which is critical for advanced anti-infectives. Auriclosene has been designated as a new chemical entity and granted broad composition of matter patent protection to 2028 by the U.S. Patent Office.
 
AIS (Urology) 

Our urology program utilizes the technology of our Aganocide compounds and is in an advanced stage of clinical development. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful results have been reported from two Phase 2 clinical studies with our Auriclosene Irrigation Solution (“AIS”) in urinary catheter blockage and encrustation (“UCBE”).  We announced the results of a Phase 2b clinical study in September 2016 which demonstrated that AIS, when compared with the product that represents the current standard of care, proved more effective in reducing urinary blockage in patients with chronic indwelling urinary catheters who have repeat history of blockage. In this study, AIS exhibited the potential for rapid decolonization of a range of urologic pathogens. Approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. currently chronically suffer from UCBE.  We estimate that the healthcare costs to manage these patients is in the billion-dollar range.

CelleRx (Dermatology).
 
 Created for cosmetic procedures, CelleRx (0.015% Neutrox) is a gentle cleansing solution that is effective for post-laser resurfacing, chemical peels and other cosmetic surgery procedures. Cosmetic surgeons and aesthetic dermatologists have found that CelleRx results in less pain, erythema, and exudate compared to Dakin solution, which contains bleach impurities. CelleRx is a non-alcohol formulation that doesn’t dry or stain the skin, and most importantly, has been shown to reduce the patient’s downtime post procedure.
 
 CelleRx is well positioned in the cosmetic surgery and aesthetic dermatology space as an adjunct therapy for the pre/post procedural phase of chemical and laser facial skin peels. Currently many generic creams and salves, as well as home-mixed acetic acid potions, are used for this purpose. We believe that CelleRx is clearly differentiated in this field. CelleRx is unique prescription product with 510(k) clearance as a skin and wound cleanser. CelleRx has proven to be safe, soothing and have an unusually broad spectrum antimicrobial action in solution. Many clinicians have used the product clinically and have reported excellent results.
 
intelli-Case
 
 In addition to improving the eyecare of many Americans through promoting Avenova for lid and lash hygiene, we have developed a contact lens case that improves the safety of those contact lens wearers who use hydrogen peroxide solution to disinfect their lenses. In June 2015, we received FDA-clearance for the intelli-Case, a highly innovative, easy-to-use device for use with hydrogen peroxide disinfection solutions for soft and rigid gas permeable contact lenses. More than 24 million Americans disinfect their contact lenses with a multipurpose disinfection system to prevent potentially serious infections. Approximately two million use hydrogen peroxide as a disinfection solution. Many ophthalmologists and optometrists favor the disinfection and lens material compatibility peroxide systems provide, yet side effects associated with misuse and non-compliance minimize peroxide system use. Hydrogen peroxide in too low of a concentration does not fully disinfect lenses and in too high of a concentration can severely irritate the eye.
 
 The intelli-Case monitors the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide during the disinfection cycle with sophisticated microprocessor electronics embedded in the cap of what otherwise looks like a standard peroxide lens case. The LED indicators on the lid inform the user if the lenses are safe to insert into the eyes, resulting in a disinfection system that is safe yet simple to use. We are seeking potential partners with the resources to make this breakthrough device available to the largest number of contact lens wearers as soon as possible.  
NeutroPhase (Wound Care).
 
We believe that NeutroPhase is a well-suited product to treat the six million patients in the U.S. who suffer from chronic non-healing wounds, such as pressure, venous stasis and diabetic ulcers. Consisting of 0.03% Neutrox, NeutroPhase is used to cleanse and remove microorganisms from any type of acute or chronic wound, and can be used with any type of wound care modality. Recently, NeutroPhase has been found to be an effective irrigation solution as part of the adjunct treatment for Necrotizing Fasciitis (“NF”). Also known as flesh-eating disease, NF typically has a high mortality and amputation rate (30% and 70%, respectively) even with aggressive debridement and antibiotic treatment. In vitro studies have shown that, in solution, NeutroPhase both kills the microorganisms implicated in NF and neutralizes the toxins secreted by the microorganisms. Success using NeutroPhase as an irrigation solution has established it as an effective part of the adjunct treatment for this deadly disease. 
 
In March 2015, the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation (“NNFF”) named NeutroPhase its official “Flesh Eating Disease” wound cleanser. The NNFF is a non-profit organization established in 1997 by two survivors of the disease. NNFF has evolved to become the world’s leading resource for information regarding necrotizing fasciitis, as well as a repository of cases reported worldwide. 
 
NeutroPhase is competing in a crowded wound cleanser market with many older and lower-priced products with similar uses. However, we believe NeutroPhase has distinct competitive advantages in a market where there is currently no dominant product. In the U.S. and internationally, NeutroPhase is distributed through commercial partners, such as Pioneer Pharma Company Limited, or “Pioneer,” a Shanghai-based company, for the distribution of NeutroPhase throughout Southeast Asia and mainland China and in the U.S., by Principle Business Enterprise (“PBE”).
 
U.S. FDA Regulatory Clearance of Neutrox-based Products. We are marketing Avenova, NeutroPhase, and CelleRx as medical devices regulated under the FDA 510(k) process. Avenova and CelleRx fall under the general intended use of skin and wound cleansers. NeutroPhase was cleared by the U.S. FDA “for use under the supervision of healthcare professionals for cleansing and removal of foreign material, including microorganisms and debris from wounds, and for moistening absorbent wound dressings and cleaning minor cuts, minor burns, superficial abrasions, and minor irritations of the skin. It is also intended for moistening and debriding acute and chronic dermal lesions, such as Stage I to IV pressure ulcers, stasis ulcers, leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, post-surgical wounds, first and second degree burns, and grafted and donor sites.
