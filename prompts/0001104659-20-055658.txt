Recent Developments
 
In fiscal year 2019, we developed and began execution of a turnaround plan to stabilize and then grow our business. This plan includes strategies aimed at enhancing our financial performance, which has declined primarily as a result of our continued comparable sales declines. See “Our Growth Strategy” below for additional information. We began realizing benefits from our turnaround plan in the back half of fiscal year 2019, mainly due to modifications to our buying, merchandising and planning activities that allowed us to return to a demand based, read and react customer model. As a result, we saw a deceleration in the decrease in our comparable sales, ending fiscal year 2019 with a 4% decline compared to a 14% decline in fiscal year 2018 and an 11% decline in fiscal year 2017. Additionally, we reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by implementing measures to increase boutique team productivity and other targeted reductions across the entire organization, including workforce reductions in both our corporate office and field operations, which provided us with approximately $14.2 million in annualized savings. Our operating loss decreased to $24.0 million in fiscal year 2019 as compared to $33.5 million in fiscal year 2018. We expect to continue executing our turnaround plan until our desired results are achieved.
 
In February 2020, our Board of Directors appointed Mr. Andrew Clarke as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Class II director of our Board of Directors, effective March 9, 2020. At such time, Mr. Michael Prendergast, who served as our Interim Chief Executive Officer since February 2019, resigned from his position of Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective March 9, 2020.
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In recent months, the outbreak has spread globally and has led governments and other authorities around the world, including federal, state and local authorities in the United States, to impose measures intended to reduce its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business limitations and closures (subject to exceptions for essential operations and businesses), quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. These measures may remain in place for a significant amount of time and has resulted in the temporary closures of all of our boutiques from March 25, 2020 to April 30, 2020, when we began reopening a small number of our boutiques in locations where local shutdown orders have been lifted. These measures have also caused an overall disruption in our supply chain and operations; while our ecommerce and our distribution center remain open, they are operating at a reduced capacity. As a result, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows have been materially adversely impacted which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking aggressive and prudent actions to reduce expenses and defer payment of accounts payables and inventory purchases to preserve cash on hand. These actions include, but are not limited to:
 

· | temporary furlough of substantially all corporate and boutique employees (for the duration of boutique closures at their location and subject to reduced staffing for a phase-in period upon reopening);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | base salary reductions for our senior leadership team;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | suspension of payment of all accounts payable other than those necessary to support our ecommerce business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | deferring payment of rent at all of our boutiques, corporate headquarters and distribution facility, beginning in April 2020 subject to discussion with our landlords;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | limiting investments in our ecommerce to neccessary website and supporting functions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | suspension of all capital expenditures.

Additionally, we borrowed $5.0 million under our Amended Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase (“Amended ABL Credit Facility”) in April 2020. We also filed an income tax refund for $10.7 million with the IRS related to the provision under the Corona Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) enacted in March 2020 that allows the carryback of net operating losses to prior years. We are electing to take other available relief under the CARES Act including deferral of payment of certain payroll taxes and employee retention tax credits. We continue to evaluate the provisions of the CARES Act and the ways in which it could assist our business or improve our liquidity.
 
The inclusion of a going concern qualification in the report of our independent registered public accountant on our accompanying financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 has resulted in a violation of certain covenants under our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement (each as defined below). On May 1, 2020, we entered into a letter agreement (the “JPM Letter Agreement”) in connection with our Amended ABL Credit Agreement and a letter agreement (the “Tiger Letter Agreement”) in connection with our Term Loan Credit Agreement, in each case, to obtain a waiver from our lenders of any default or event of default arising from our failure to (i) deliver annual audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 without a “going concern” or a like qualification or exception and (ii) pay rent on leased locations for the months of April, May and June, 2020. The JPM Letter Agreement and Tiger Letter Agreement contain certain conditions and covenants, including that, in the case of the JPM Letter Agreement, we are required to use the entire $10.7 million income tax refund requested under the CARES Act to repay certain outstanding borrowings under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement and providing that no loans will be made under the ABL Credit Agreement unless our aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents is less than $3.0 million. See Item 9B of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. If we are unable to meet our financial covenants or if we have an event of default under either agreement,  including if we are unable or elect not to pay rent on our leased locations beginning in July 2020 and do not otherwise obtain a waiver from our lenders, our lenders could instruct the administrative agent under such credit facilities to exercise available remedies including, declaring the principal of and accrued interest on all outstanding indebtedness due and payable immediately and terminating all remaining commitments and obligations under the credit facilities. Although the lenders under our credit facilities may waive the defaults or forebear the exercise of remedies, they are not obligated to do so. Failure to obtain such a waiver would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and may result in filing a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring plan. See Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
 
There is significant uncertainty around the disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy. While our results of operations have been significantly impacted and we anticipate our future results will continue to be adversely impacted, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, any possible resurgence of COVID-19 that may occur after the initial outbreak subsides, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the risks we face as result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Our Philosophy
 
Our operating philosophy is grounded in the following and we believe differentiates us from our competitors:
 

· | On-trend Merchandise Delivered at a Compelling Value. Our boutiques aim to carry a broad and shallow selection of quality on-trend apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts at attractive prices that ‘surprise and delight’ our customers. Our buyers closely monitor the marketplace to identify and source proven fashion trends we believe will appeal to our core customers. We have a unique assortment as we primarily offer items under our proprietary labels. We also carry a small selection of third-party, nationally recognized brands that we use opportunistically in certain categories. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, but intentionally purchase relatively limited quantities of individual items for each boutique. We frequently replenish our boutiques with new merchandise, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting for our customers. The short lead times of our vendors maximizes our speed to market, as it generally takes four to twelve weeks from the time an order is placed to the time merchandise is available on the boutique floor. These short lead times enable us to make more informed buying decisions by allowing us to react quickly to fashion trends. This approach, combined with our balanced merchandise mix of approximately 50% apparel and 50% jewelry, accessories and gifts, is designed to encourage frequent visits by our customers and mitigate the seasonal fluctuations in sales and merchandise margin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Differentiated Shopping Experience. Each of our retail locations is designed and merchandised to feel like an upscale yet affordable boutique. Merchandise presentations, including display windows, tables and walls, are refreshed frequently to keep our boutiques new and exciting. Each boutique feels individualized and our boutique associates strive to provide a personalized and intimate guest experience by creating a high-touch service environment which increases guest engagement and enhances the shopping experience. We believe these attributes, along with our strategy of carrying a broad selection but relatively limited quantities of individual styles, create an atmosphere that appeals to our customers and differentiates us in the marketplace.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexible Boutique Format and Rigorous Real Estate Selection Process. Our boutique format typically works across a wide variety of shopping venues, market sizes, climates and demographics. Our boutiques are leased from third parties with initial lease terms of five to ten years and have an average size of 1,462 square feet, which is meaningfully smaller than most specialty retailers. Our flexible real estate format, coupled with the performance of our boutiques, has historically enhanced our ability to secure prominent, highly visible locations in regional malls, lifestyle centers, street locations, strip centers and outlet centers. The selection of the location of our boutiques benefits from our rigorous real estate selection process, with all boutique locations measured against specific financial and geographic criteria, including the calibration of occupancy costs against projected sales for new boutiques.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Solid and Scalable Infrastructure. We have invested in systems, controls and human resources to support our operations. In recent years, we have made significant improvements in our ecommerce and IT systems as well as the infrastructure of our buying, planning and allocation, real estate, boutique operations, and finance departments. We believe that we have developed an integrated sourcing, distribution and merchandising process that is scalable. This process includes buyers who work closely with an established and diverse group of vendors to identify on-trend, quality merchandise for our boutiques, as well as delivery, distribution and merchandising processes that enable us to execute a broad and shallow merchandising approach.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we can grow our revenues and earnings by executing on our turnaround plan, which includes the following strategies:
 

· | Improve Merchandise to be More On-Trend and Better Aligned with Customer Demand. We plan to increase comparable sales by having customer demand drive our merchandise assortment. In recent years, we have not successfully executed demand based, fast fashion merchandising processes. In fiscal year 2019, we returned to merchandising processes that allow us to better read and react to customer demands and that made us successful in prior years. We have accomplished this by employing simplified merchandise planning and buying processes, which includes a weekly review of product sales to analyze selling trends of best and worst sellers, maintaining appropriate levels of open to buy to chase strong selling merchandise and reducing lead times down to historical levels. Additionally, we are guided by a deliberate category hierarchy focused on three types of merchandise: fashion, seasonal and core. This category hierarchy helps ensure that our merchandise offerings are balanced and relevant to our customers. We believe this merchandising strategy has resulted and will continue to result in improvement in our conversion rates as we better meet our customers’ expectations which will then lead to improvement in our traffic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Renewed Emphasis on Demand-Based, Fast Fashion Principles in Merchandise Planning and Buying. We believe merchandise planning and buying processes that better emphasize demand-based, fast fashion principles will continue to help drive comparable sales. We believe successfully implementing these principles will enable us to continue to invest in merchandise that resonates with our customers and adjust accordingly when merchandise does not resonate with our customers. We believe our renewed focus on these principles has driven and will continue to drive improved sales and a steady flow of on-trend merchandise into our boutiques and ecommerce site. Our turnaround plan includes the following strategies that will help us better implement those principles:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We are consistently updating and adding robust analytics to our planning and buying processes in order to more quickly react to fashion trends and the resonance of our merchandise with our customers. Our buyers have immersed themselves in markets, trade shows and trend services, as well as capitalized on our vendor relationships to identify current trends in order to continuously elevate and align our product offerings with customer demand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We are continuously increasing the flexibility of our planning such that a greater portion of our merchandise will be open to buy in season, enabling our style selection and inventory investments to better respond to customer demand.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We continue to employ a wide scale testing strategy that is helping us evaluate promotional strategies with the goal of expanding impactful wins to all boutiques and our ecommerce site.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Right Size Our Expense Structure. In early fiscal 2019, we reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by implementing targeted reductions across the entire organization, including workforce reductions in both our corporate office and field management, which provided us with approximately $8.0 million in annualized savings. While we are continuing to look for further efficiencies in our cost structure, we believe that any additional savings will not materially impact our financial results.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase Boutique Team Productivity. We believe through focused monitoring of our boutique labor and sales metrics we can better utilize our sales associates’ time without sacrificing the customer experience. For example, certain tasks that were previously performed by our associates after boutique hours are now completed when our boutiques are open but during the windows that our data shows that boutique traffic is lighter. Additionally, our use of an enhanced scheduling tool, that is continuously reviewed and refined, has better aligned boutique payroll expense to sales levels. These initiatives resulted in a decrease in total labor hours used and savings of approximately of $6.2 million for fiscal year 2019. While we are continuing to look for additional ways to increase boutique team productivity, we believe that any additional labor efficiencies we may identify in the future will not materially impact on our financial results.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimize Existing Real Estate Fleet. While we believe we have an opportunity to grow our boutique base in the United States based on our flexible boutique format and the financial characteristics of our boutiques, we are currently focused on optimizing our existing real estate fleet. In particular, we are continuing to focus on optimizing the lease expense structure for our existing boutiques, with an emphasis towards calibrating occupancy costs with sales levels and negotiating with landlords for early lease terminations or rent concessions for underperforming boutiques and early lease extensions for our best performing boutiques. Additionally, we continue to regularly review our existing boutiques for opportunistic closures to increase the overall health of our fleet without incurring material write-offs associated with such closures. As a result of such review, we closed 21 underperforming boutiques during fiscal year 2019.

Our History
 
In 1999, our company was founded and we opened our first boutique in Houston, Texas. Initially, we focused on selling fashion jewelry, accessories and selected home décor. As our boutique base grew across the United States we expanded our merchandise offering to include apparel, which has become our largest category. In July 2011, we became a publicly-traded company.
Our Market
 
Our distinct boutique environment and carefully selected merchandise focused on quality, on-trend offerings at a compelling value attracts a wide demographic. Our unique merchandise combination of apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts allows us to participate in a number of large market segments. While our broad assortment appeals to women of varying ages and diverse backgrounds, from the value-conscious to the more affluent, our core guest is a fashion-conscious woman between the ages of 18 and 35. She tends to be college educated and has moderate to high disposable income. She enjoys shopping for the latest fashion and is attracted to our upscale boutique shopping environment, compelling value proposition and personalized customer service. We believe she spends a higher proportion of her income on fashion than the general population.
Our Merchandise Offering and Merchandising Strategy
 
We offer a broad and shallow selection of fashion apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts targeted to our core customer, who seeks on-trend, quality merchandise at attractive prices. We use the term broad and shallow to refer to a diverse merchandise assortment with limited quantities of each item than most specialty retailers. In addition to our broad assortment, we deliver new merchandise to our boutiques every week offering our customer constant newness. We have a balanced assortment of merchandise categories with approximately 50% of our fiscal year 2019 sales generated by non-apparel items.
 
Our wide range of apparel, jewelry and accessories fills the various casual and dressy fashion needs of our customers and our selection of gifts range from fun to elegant. The majority of our merchandise is sold under our proprietary labels and we also sell a select assortment of third-party, nationally recognized brands. Our ecommerce website features the same merchandise offered in our boutiques coupled with online exclusives. Additionally, our ecommerce inventory is available to order in-boutique in the same transaction as in-boutique purchases or in a separate transaction. The table below shows the approximate breakdown of our fiscal year 2019 net sales by merchandise category: 
 

Apparel 46% of Net Sales | Jewelry 27% of Net Sales | Accessories 16% of Net Sales | Gifts 10% of Net Sales 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dresses, Fashion Tops, Sweaters, Cardigans and Wraps, Bottoms, Outerwear and Jackets, Tees and Tanks, Intimates | Necklaces, Earrings, Bracelets, Rings | Handbags, Clutches, Wallets, Shoes, Belts, Hats, Scarves, Sunglasses, Watches, Beauty, Hair Accessories | Fragrance, Candles, Bath and Body, Home Accessories, Books, Wall Art, Nail Polish, Miscellaneous Items

 
We believe we can improve our conversion rate, traffic and our flow of on-trend merchandise by continuing to implement our strategies of customer demand driving our merchandise assortment and our renewed emphasis on demand based, fast fashion principles in merchandise planning and buying.
 
Our buying team is responsible for selecting and sourcing our merchandise. Each merchandise category has a set of dedicated buyers. Our planning and allocation team assists in managing inventory levels and allocating items to boutiques. The teams hold weekly meetings to review merchandise performance and identify new fashion trends. Our buyers also make regular trips to important industry markets and trade shows. We have access to the expertise of hundreds of designers employed by our large vendor base who provide us with a large selection of new styles for review. Our buyers collaborate with vendors to place special orders and to modify presented styles based on current fashion trends and their in-depth knowledge of our customers’ preferences, which means most of our merchandise is typically unique to francesca’s. Before placing an order, every item is evaluated for style, quality, fit, value and profitability to ensure it meets standards consistent with the francesca’s ® brand. Every item is also evaluated to confirm that it fits within our category hierarchy comprised of fashion, seasonal or core categories. In order to clear slow moving inventory, in addition to normal promotional and markdown activities, we regularly mark certain merchandise out-of-stock and dispose of such inventory at a pace suitable for our merchandising strategy.

Our Sourcing Strategy
 
Our renewed emphasis on a demand based, fast fashion model in merchandise planning and buying, combined with the short production lead times of our vendors, maximizes our speed to market. We primarily use vendors based in the United States that source from both domestic and overseas markets and it generally takes four to twelve weeks from the time an order is placed to the time merchandise is available on the boutique floor. These short lead times enable us to make more informed buying decisions in terms of customers’ merchandise expectations, and to quickly react to changing fashion trends. This also supports our merchandise strategy of offering a broad and shallow assortment that is consistently refreshed.
 
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We have relationships with a diverse base of approximately 400 vendors and transact business on a purchase-order-by-purchase order basis. In fiscal year 2019, we sourced approximately 97% of our merchandise from 200 vendors while our top 10 vendors sourced approximately 35% of our merchandise, with no single vendor accounting for more than 6% of our purchases. We believe that the loss of any single current vendor would not result in a material disruption to our business.
 
We do not enter into exclusive contracts with our vendors and we continue to optimize our vendor network. This provides us with access to an even more extensive variety of merchandise from a greater number of vendors at competitive prices. We believe our vendors view us as an important customer given our market position. Our vendors utilize a network of domestic and overseas factories, providing them access to significant capacity.
 
Each of our vendors is required to adhere to our vendor standards, which are designed to ensure that our vendors conduct their business in a legal, ethical and responsible manner. This also includes the requirement that all of our vendors comply with the applicable laws and regulations of the United States, those of the respective country of manufacture or exportation and all state and local laws and regulations. To date, we have not experienced any significant impact from the trading polices of the United States or its trading partners. 
 
Our Sales Channels
 
We conduct business through our boutiques and our ecommerce website, www.francescas.com. We do not incorporate the information contained on, or accessible through, the investor relations section of our website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and it should not be considered a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Boutiques
 
As of February 1, 2020, we operated 711 boutiques under the name francesca’s® in 47 states throughout the United States and the District of Columbia. Our long-term strategy depends on our ability to successfully operate existing and new boutiques in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our current priority remains to implement the strategies discussed above under “Our Growth Strategy” to continue to enhance comparable sales and profitability. We plan to resume boutique openings in the future as appropriate once the desired results of our turnaround plan are achieved. The table below shows the number of boutiques operated by state as of February 1, 2020.

Boutique Design and Environment
 
The differentiated shopping experience offered through our boutiques is central to the francesca’s® brand. Our boutiques are designed and merchandised to deliver a warm and inviting atmosphere that creates a boutique shopping experience. We also aim to provide a personalized in-boutique guest experience by creating a high-touch service environment with a focus on engaging, connecting and inspiring our customers. Although we strive to maintain a relatively consistent look and feel in all of our boutiques, the intricacies of each boutique’s physical properties, geographic market and shopping venue make each feel different and in tune with its local clientele.
 
Our boutiques typically range in size from 1,000 to 2,000 square feet, with an average size of 1,462 square feet as of February 1, 2020. Our locations typically have a boutique front that is at least 25 feet wide, which we adorn with visually appealing architectural lighting, signage and display window presentations. Inside, we use a variety of color palettes and soft lighting. Each boutique’s merchandise presentation, including display windows, tables and walls, is refreshed frequently to keep our shopping experience new and exciting. We believe by constantly changing our visual merchandising and presentation, we give our customers a reason to shop our boutiques frequently, building customer loyalty. Our boutique managers also share best-practices with each other. We believe these grass-root interactions improve the sense of community among our boutique managers and enhance the shopping experience for our customers.
 
Staffing in our boutiques consists of a boutique manager, an assistant manager and part-time associates. Our compensation structure includes a bonus component payable upon the achievement of certain financial goals. We endeavor to hire boutique personnel that are friendly and customer-service driven individuals. In addition to training programs for visual merchandising, customer service and operations, boutique managers benefit from ongoing field-level support and training updates as well as guides and manuals.
 
Boutique Openings, Closures and Remodels
 
During fiscal year 2018, we opened 32 boutiques with an average size of approximately 2,033 square feet. These boutiques generated average sales of approximately $621,000 in the first year and are expected to pay back our pre-tax net investment, on average, in approximately three and a half years. Our average pre-tax net investment consisted of $276,000 in average boutique build-out costs (net of $44,000 average tenant allowance) and $56,000 in average inventory. The payback period for boutiques opened in fiscal year 2018 was significantly longer compared to the payback period for boutiques opened in years prior to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a decrease in overall boutique profitability as well as increasing boutique build-out costs, partly as a result of opening more boutiques in outlet centers, which are generally larger in size compared to boutiques in other venues.
 
The table below indicates certain historical information regarding our boutiques as of the end of each of the periods indicated below:

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Net sales per average square foot is calculated by dividing net sales for the period by the average total square feet during the period. For purposes of providing net sales per square- foot measure, we use average square feet during the period as opposed to total gross square feet at the end of the period. Average square feet is calculated as (a) the sum of total gross square feet at the beginning of the period and total gross square feet at the end of each fiscal quarter within the period, divided by (b) the number of fiscal quarters within the period plus one (which, for a fiscal year, is five). There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate sales per square foot or similarly titled measures. As a result, average square feet and net sales per average square foot for the period may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.

Our flexible boutique format has enabled us to successfully open boutiques across a variety of shopping venues, market sizes, climates and demographics. Our real estate committee has consistently utilized a disciplined approach to site selection, which analyzes the prospective shopping venue for factors such as overall shopping venue productivity, competitive environment and specific sales of other retailers deemed most relevant as well as the configuration of available space for potential new boutique locations. When selecting a location for a new boutique, we seek prominent locations in high-traffic areas of the shopping venue and in close proximity to other retailers targeting similar customers. We also evaluate each new boutique location based on projected sales and determine whether the capital investment and estimated boutique four-wall contribution satisfies our targeted return threshold, occupancy costs, and boutique contribution. We believe these attributes have provided us, and will continue to provide us, with a wide scope of real estate opportunities and enhances our ability to profitably expand our boutique base. Our current priority remains to implement the strategies of our turnaround plan discussed above under “Our Growth Strategy” to enhance comparable sales. We plan to resume boutique openings in the future as appropriate when the desired results are achieved under our turnaround plan.
 
We continuously review the overall economic performance of our boutiques. As part of our economic review process, we evaluate a variety of factors such as expected future revenue and contribution margin, applicable market conditions, our co-tenancy requirements, unamortized portion of leasehold improvements, our ability to terminate the underlying lease obligation and related cost of any such early termination. As a result of such review, we closed 21 underperforming boutiques during fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2020, we will continue to focus on optimizing our existing real estate fleet by reviewing the lease expense structure for our existing boutiques, with an emphasis towards calibrating occupancy costs and sales levels, negotiating with landlords for early lease terminations or rent concessions for underperforming boutiques and early extensions for our best performing boutiques, as appropriate. 
 
In fiscal year 2018, we started a boutique remodel program where we refreshed 81 high-volume existing boutiques. We view this refresh program as an important investment to continually enhance the customer shopping experience. While we put a pause on this program in fiscal year 2019 due to the recent challenges in our business, we currently intend to reinitiate this program when the desired results are achieved under our turnaround plan.
 
Ecommerce
 
Our ecommerce operations consists of our www.francescas.com website. Through our website, our customers are able to purchase individual items, shop the latest jewelry, gift or fashion merchandise and special promotions, create a wish list, sign up for our customer email list, connect and follow us on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, as well as obtain current information on our boutique locations. This channel enables us to further build our brand, address the growing preference for online shopping and reach customers in all areas where we currently do not have a boutique. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and we plan to make necessary investments in our website and supporting functions that will further enhance our customers’ shopping experience as well as establish the framework for our long-term ecommerce strategies. During fiscal 2018, we invested in a warehouse management system to support our ecommerce operations. We intend to make the necessary investments in our ecommerce website and supporting functions in fiscal year 2020 and beyond, which we believe will further enhance our customers’ shopping experience. We believe there is significant potential to expand this channel over time with our current infrastructure.
Omni-Channel Customer Experience
 
We have made significant investments in our technology systems and enabled certain omni-channel capabilities, including “buy-online and ship-to-boutique” and “buy-in-boutique and ship-to-home,” which offer a consistent and seamless shopping experience both in-boutique or online. We believe that the line between our boutiques and ecommerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-boutique and online. We are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional and seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers.
Marketing and Advertising
 
We have historically focused on organic, viral and in-boutique marketing to increase customer loyalty and build our brand image. By locating our boutiques in prominent, high-traffic locations and our limited use of traditional radio and print advertising, we encourage people to ‘discover’ francesca’s ®. We believe that many of our customers develop a personal connection with our boutiques and become our ambassadors in the local community by spreading the word about francesca’s ®. Our boutique managers are passionate about francesca’s® and contribute to our marketing effort by participating in shopping center or community sponsored marketing events. We also use email communications, our website and, increasingly, social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, individual social media influencers and fashion related blogs to achieve our marketing goals. We plan to continue to focus our investments in the appropriate marketing programs to build customer loyalty. In fiscal year 2018, we launched a nationwide customer loyalty program, franRewards, where members may receive free gifts, discounts as well as early access to certain promotions. Our loyalty program is aimed at driving traffic into our boutiques, better understand our customers’ purchasing pattern as well as support various strategic initiatives. Benefits under our loyalty program have currently been put on hold. We are in the process of evaluating the structure of our rewards program and intend to resume providing benefits upon the conclusion of such assessment.

Distribution
 
We distribute most of our merchandise from our distribution center (located within our corporate headquarters) in Houston, Texas. Our current facility occupies approximately 218,000 square feet, consisting of approximately 165,000 square feet of warehouse and distribution space, which services our boutiques and ecommerce, and approximately 53,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters. Our merchandise is generally received, inspected, managed, stored and distributed through our distribution warehouse. The majority of our merchandise is pre-ticketed and pre-sorted by our vendors which allows us to efficiently ship from our distribution center directly to our boutiques, thereby reducing labor costs. Due to the relatively small size of our boutiques, we ship smaller packages of fresh merchandise weekly. Hence, we are able to utilize third party shipping vendors to effectively distribute merchandise on a continuous basis, ensuring successful execution of our broad and shallow merchandising strategy. We believe that our current facilities will be sufficient to support our growth plans for several years.
Management Information Systems
 
Our management information technology systems provide support and timely information to our management team. We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allows us to identify and respond to operating trends in our business. We use a combination of customized and industry-standard software systems to support boutique point-of-sale, merchandise planning and buying, ecommerce, inventory management, financial reporting and administrative functions.
 

In prior years, we deployed new technologies to enhance our omni-channel and customer engagement capabilities as part of our long-term strategic plan. Specifically, in fiscal year 2017, we completed our legacy point-of-sale system replacement and the implementation of a new customer relationship management system and, in October 2018, we completed the implementation of a new warehouse management system for ecommerce. These new systems have enhanced our visibility into our customers’ preferences, merchandise products and supply chain which we expect will result in improved customer service, improved operational efficiency, enhanced management analytics and increased inventory synergies between our ecommerce and our boutique channels.
 
We will remain diligent in our efforts to maintain the functionality and performance of our existing enterprise applications and infrastructure to support the Company’s turnaround and growth plans.
 
Competition
 
The women’s apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts market is large, fragmented and highly competitive. Our largest competitors include national and regional department stores, value retailers, specialty retailers, mass merchants and internet-based retailers. Due to the breadth of our merchandise, it is difficult to identify companies that compete with us in every product category. We generally compete with individual, often owner-operated specialty shops in each of the markets that we operate as well as broadly merchandised department stores and certain specialty stores. We also face intense competition from the ecommerce platforms of our brick and mortar competitors, as well as internet-based retailers due to the continuing shift in customer demand away from brick and mortar to ecommerce. We may also face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors if and when we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
 
The principal basis upon which we compete is by offering a differentiated shopping experience through quality, on-trend merchandise at attractive prices in a warm and inviting boutique environment with personalized customer service. Our manageable boutique size and flexible but disciplined real estate strategy provide us with a competitive advantage that is not easily replicated by our major competitors. Our success also depends in substantial part on our ability to respond quickly to fashion trends so that we can meet the changing demands of our customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have registered our trademark francesca’s® with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We own domain names, including www.francescas.com , and we own unregistered copyright in our website content. We believe our trademarks have value, and we diligently protect them against infringement. For instance, we have filed applications to register our trademark internationally. We will also continue to file new applications as appropriate to protect our intellectual property rights.

Regulation and Legislation
 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising and promotions, privacy laws, product and other safety regulations, consumer protection regulations, environmental requirements and other laws that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of boutiques and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws in all material respects.
Privacy Laws
 
In the course of our operations, we gather, process, transmit and store customer information, including personal, payment, credit and other confidential and private information such as home addresses and birthdays. Our collection, retention, transfer and use of this information are governed by U.S. laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, as well as industry standards and protocols. The regulatory framework for privacy and information security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the United States, federal and various state governmental bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations limiting, or laws and regulations regarding the collection, distribution, use, disclosure, storage, and security of certain categories of information. Some of these requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from exploitation of a vulnerability in our systems or services or breaches experienced by us. For example, the State of California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy ACT (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA expands the scope of what is considered “personal information” and creates new data access and opt-out rights for consumers, which creates new requirements for us and other companies that operate in California. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
Labor and Employment Laws
 
We are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various other federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our boutique personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs, as would future increases. Our vendors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods supplied to us and our boutiques. We may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters.
Insurance
 
We use insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, cyber security and employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis and believe we maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Our Employees
 
As of February 1, 2020, we had 5,236 total employees. Of our total employees, 1,159 are full time employees and 4,077 are part time employees. As of April 15, 2020, substantially all our corporate and boutique employees were furloughed as a result of temporary boutique closures and various state and local “stay-at-home” orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have had no labor-related work stoppages as of February 1, 2020. Our relationship with our employees is one of the keys to our success and we believe that relationship is satisfactory.
Seasonality
 
Our wide-range of merchandise and our strategy of carrying a broad selection but limited quantities of each item reduce our overall seasonality relative to other specialty retailers. Nevertheless, our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and lowest in the first fiscal quarter. As a result of this seasonality and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales and working capital requirements during the year. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Seasonality” for more information.

In the course of our business, we collect information about our customers, including customer data submitted to us in connection with purchases of our merchandise at boutiques as well as from our ecommerce website. We respect the privacy of our customers and take steps to safeguard the confidentiality of the information that they provide to us.
Securities and Exchange Commission Filings
 
We maintain a website at www.francescas.com. We provide, free of charge, access to various reports that we file with, or furnish to, the SEC through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed or furnished with the SEC.
