ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a high growth, biotechnology company at the forefront of delivering sustainable solutions that are better for people and the planet. To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable consumption, we create, manufacture and commercialize consumer products and ingredients that reach more than 300 million consumers. Currently, the largest driver of our revenue is derived from marketing and selling Clean Beauty, Personal Care and Health & Wellness consumer products through our direct-to-consumer ecommerce platforms and a growing network of retail partners. We also sell sustainable ingredients to sector leaders that serve Flavor & Fragrance (F&F), Nutrition, Food & Beverage, and Clean Beauty & Personal Care end markets. 
Our ingredients and consumer products are powered by our fermentation-based Lab-to-MarketTM technology platform. This technology platform drives the portfolio connection between our proprietary science and formulation expertise, our manufacturing capability at industrial scale, and our ability to commercialize sustainable products that make a difference in people’s lives. We believe that our technology platform offers advantages to traditional methods of sourcing similar ingredients (such as petrochemistry and extraction from organisms). Our technology platform allows for renewable and ethical sourcing of raw materials, less resource-intensive production, minimal impact on sensitive ecosystems, enhanced purity and safety profile, less vulnerability to climate disruption, and improved supply chain resilience. We bring together biology and engineering to generate more sustainable materials that would otherwise be scarce or endangered in nature. Our technology platform leverages state-of-the-art machine learning, robotics and artificial intelligence, enabling us to rapidly bring new innovation to market. Our revenue is generated from consumer product sales, ingredient product sales, research and development collaboration programs and grants, and consumer marketing services.
We were founded in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay Area by scientists from the University of California, Berkeley. Through a grant in 2005 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology capable of creating microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin, an anti-malarial drug. Through our new technology, we produced a renewable farnesene brand, Biofene®, a long-chain, branched hydrocarbon molecule that we manufacture through fermentation using engineered microbes, initially targeted at the renewable fuel market. Over the last decade, we strategically transitioned our business model from low margin commodity markets to higher margin specialty ingredients markets. We partner with our customers to create sustainable, high performance, cost competitive molecules that replace a less sustainable ingredient in their supply chains. We commercially scale and manufacture those molecules and have 13 molecules currently in the market.
The ingredients we have created through our technology platform are an integral part of how we differentiate our brands. We have successfully formulated our sustainably sourced, fermentation-based ingredients such as Squalane, HemisqualaneTM, and Steviol Glycoside Rebaudioside M (Reb M) into our consumer brands. All of our non-government partnerships include commercial terms for the supply of molecules we produce at commercial scale. The first molecule to generate revenue for us after farnesene was a fragrance molecule launched in 2015. Since this launch, our partners have indicated increasing demand due to the cost-advantaged position, high purity, and sustainable production methods of our molecules. In 2019, we commercially produced and shipped our Reb M that is an alternative sweetener and zero calorie sugar replacement for food and beverages. We added six new ingredients to our portfolio in 2020 and three new ingredients to our portfolio in 2021.
Our time from lab to market for molecules has decreased from three to four years to less than a year for our most recent molecule, mainly due to our ability to leverage our technology platform with proprietary strain construction, screening and analytics tools, advanced lab automation, and data integration. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes industry-leading strain engineering and lab automation located in Emeryville, California, pilot-scale production facilities in Emeryville and Campinas, Brazil, a demonstration-scale facility in Campinas and a commercial scale production facility in Leland, North Carolina (which is part of our Aprinnova joint venture). While a wide variety of feedstocks for production exists, we source Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its supply resilience, renewability, low cost, and relative price stability. We are in the process of constructing a new purpose-built, large-scale specialty ingredients facility in Brazil, which we anticipate will allow for the manufacture of up to five products concurrently. We expect construction to be completed in the first half of 2022. Pending commissioning of the new facility, we continue to manufacture our products at manufacturing sites in Brazil, the United States and Europe.
Consumer Revenue 
We began 2021 with three consumer brands, Biossance® clean beauty skincare, Pipette® clean baby skincare, and PurecaneTM zero-calorie sweetener. During the second half of 2021, we launched five additional consumer brands in the Clean Beauty & Personal Care end market, including Terasana® clean skincare, Costa Brazil® luxury skincare, OLIKATM clean wellness, Rose Inc.TM clean color cosmetics, and JVNTM clean haircare. See "Properties" in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our new leased office and retail space for certain of our consumer brands. 
We have various retail partnerships associated with our consumer business. These partners include Sephora, Target, Amazon, Walmart, and others. We also partner with various brand ambassadors who share our vision for a sustainable future to build brand recognition for our consumer brands, including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for Pipette, Jonathan Van Ness for Biossance and JVN Haircare, and Reese Witherspoon for Biossance. We have used equity, royalty, or consulting arrangements to remunerate these ambassadors for their engagement with our brands.
Ingredients License Revenue
We partner with sector leaders in the broader ingredients sector to bring our unique, sustainably sourced ingredients to market. Through these partnerships, we realize the market potential of our ingredients by leveraging their large go-to-market footprint, commercial relationships, and formulation capability. We have active partnerships with Koninklijke DSM N.V. (DSM) for our F&F portfolio, Ingredion Incorporated (Ingredion) for our Reb M, Yifan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Yifan) for our vitamins, MF 92 VENTURES LLC (Minerva) for the sustainable production and distribution of products in the recombinant protein segment, and ImmunityBio (ImmunityBio) for a COVID-19 vaccine. 
In 2017, we monetized the use of one of our mature molecules in certain fields of use by licensing farnesene to DSM. We also sold to DSM our subsidiary Amyris Brasil Ltda., which owned and operated a biofuel manufacturing facility in Brotas, Brazil that manufactures farnesene. On March 31, 2021, we entered into a license agreement and asset purchase agreement pursuant to which DSM acquired exclusive rights to our F&F product portfolio, which included intellectual property licenses and the assignment of related supply agreements, for upfront consideration totaling $150 million, and up to $235 million of contingent consideration if certain commercial milestones are achieved between 2022 and 2024 (for payout in 2023 through 2025). We also entered into a 15-year manufacturing agreement to manufacture certain F&F ingredients for DSM for supply to third parties.
In the second quarter of 2018, we successfully demonstrated our industrial process at full-scale to produce a high-purity, zero-calorie sweetener derived from sugarcane, and in the fourth quarter of 2018, we were notified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that we received its Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) designation concurrence and began producing commercial quantities of Reb M. Our Reb M is produced from sugarcane, making it more sustainable and cost efficient than other natural sweeteners, and we believe its profile provides advantages in taste and total process economics for blends and formulations. In June 2021, we entered into an intellectual property license agreement with PureCircle Limited (PureCircle), a subsidiary of Ingredion, whereby we (i) granted certain intellectual property licenses to PureCircle to make, have made, commercialize and advance the development of sustainably sourced, zero-calorie, nature-based sweeteners and potentially other types of fermentation-based ingredients, as the exclusive global business-to-business commercialization partner for our sugar reduction technology, (ii) entered into a product supply and profit sharing agreement to provide manufacturing services and products to PureCircle, and (iii) assigned and transferred certain customer contracts to PureCircle related to the sale and distribution of Reb M. We continue to own and market our Purecane® consumer brand offering of tabletop and culinary sweetener products. As consideration for the license and product supply agreements, we received a $10 million license fee at closing and may receive additional payments in the aggregate of up to $35 million upon achievement of certain milestones related to Reb M sales and manufacturing cost targets. Additionally, under the product supply and profit sharing agreement, we will earn revenues from product sales to PureCircle and a profit share from future product sales, including RebM (alone or in a blended product), by PureCircle.
In the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with a subsidiary of Yifan, a leading Chinese pharmaceutical company. Collaboration and research and development work continue under three active licenses with a subsidiary of Yifan.
Research and Development, Joint Ventures and Collaborations Revenue 
From time to time, we enter into joint ventures and collaborations with partners for the commercialization of our ingredients. For example, in 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd., an existing 
commercial partner of ours, and Nippon Surfactant Industries Co., Ltd., an affiliate of Nikko (collectively, Nikko) to focus on the worldwide commercialization of the Neossance cosmetic ingredients business. The joint venture was re-named Aprinnova, LLC. In 2020, we formed a new entity (Clean Beauty Collaborative) with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to collaborate in the development of a new line of cosmetics products leveraging the Rose, Inc. brand and content platform and our bioengineered ingredients, including Squalane and Hemisqualane. In 2021, Rose, Inc. launched its first collection of clean cosmetics and skincare products. In 2021, we also entered into joint venture agreements with Minerva to develop molecules for the sustainable production and distribution of products in the recombinant protein segment, and with ImmunityBio, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company, for the development of vaccines, including a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine. In connection with entering into license and product supply agreements with PureCircle in June 2021 as described above, Ingredion purchased a minority membership interest in Amyris RealSweet LLC (RealSweet), our subsidiary, which owns the new manufacturing facility under construction in Brazil.
We also work with committed long-term collaboration partners who are leaders in their respective sectors. These partners provide rapid access to large-scale volumes, expertise regarding current ingredient demand, and an understanding of costs and other specifications that support market adoption. These partnerships assist us in ensuring market fit, technology need, and scale. Our partners access our Lab-to-Market technology platform and industrial fermentation expertise to reduce environmental impact, enhance performance, reduce supply and price volatility, and improve cost. Our partners include F&F companies such as Firmenich S.A. (Firmenich) and Givaudan International, SA (Givaudan), nutrition companies such as DSM and Yifan, and food ingredient companies such as Ingredion. We have also worked closely with the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
Technology
Our Lab-to-Market technology platform utilizes highly optimized and automated molecular biology, analytical, and process development tools combined with machine learning algorithms and statistical models to transform the way microbes metabolize sugars. Specifically, we engineer microbes, such as yeast, and use them as catalysts to convert sugar, through fermentation, into the chemicals used in our everyday lives. We believe that we are one of the first companies to apply microbial engineering towards the manufacturing of a wide range of molecules with commercial applications. Over the last decade, this has required significant, targeted investment in our research and development capabilities. To date, we have successfully scaled up 13 molecules with multiple molecules in development. This investment has also resulted in the development of a suite of strains capable of producing greater than 250 molecules across 15 chemical classes. 
In addition to investment of our own funds, we have also been awarded multiple grants from the U.S. government; together, these funds have been used to develop our Lab-to-Market technology platform comprised of highly optimized strain and process development methods, sophisticated machine learning algorithms and statistical models, and proprietary robotic tools.
We built our Lab-to-Market technology platform based on commercial and technological considerations. A few of the commercial considerations that impact our molecule selection are:
1.Our core activities in Clean Beauty & Personal Care and Health & Wellness; 
2.Industries or commercial opportunities where our technology can deliver the best performance, sustainability profile and value, in accordance with our No Compromise® commitment; and
3.Economic opportunities based on either the size of the total addressable market or the ability of our formulation to disrupt the market. 
Certain technological considerations impact our molecule development selection such as, for example, our ability to:
1.Leverage our existing technology platform in new ways based on prior learnings relating to metabolic pathways and chemical properties;
2.Amplify value by differentiating new applications; 
3.Match new chemical classes with new end markets; and
4.Valorize fermentation process and other agricultural waste streams. 
Strain Engineering
Researchers around the world are continuously learning how the complex biological processes in organisms work. We believe that the best method for development of commercially viable strains is to test as many hypotheses as accurately and quickly as possible to accelerate this learning process. Our proprietary Lab-to-Market technology platform allows us to design, 
build and analyze thousands of strains in a single experiment, thereby enabling us to test thousands of hypotheses simultaneously. Extensive automation across our pipeline has resulted in significant decreases in the average time and cost to engineer a manufacturing-ready strain. In total, we have had an exponential increase in the number of molecules in our pipeline in active development with relatively minimal increases in our yearly R&D spend.
Importantly, through our lab-scale and pilot-plant fermentation operations, and our proprietary analytical tools, we are now able to predict, with high reliability, the performance of candidate strains at industrial scale.
Process Development
In order to maximize the quantity and quality of products we produce, we have invested extensively in advanced capabilities (including prediction models and analytical tools), which include fermentation optimization and the development of scalable product isolation techniques which enable cost effective manufacturing. We have developed scalable manufacturing processes for a wide variety of product types, including insoluble liquids and solids, intracellular products, water soluble solids, and gaseous products. Recently developed products have required increasingly complex purification strains and stringent product purity requirements, yet the overall time to develop a scalable, cost-effective manufacturing process has decreased due to a combination of increased automation and experience.
Upscaling and Commercialization
Microbial engineering can be unpredictable, and successful commercialization depends heavily on expertise in process scale-up and manufacturing. We have successfully scaled up and commercially manufactured 13 distinct molecules included in thousands of leading global brands. Our process development and technology transfer expertise results in accelerated speed to market, lower overall product development costs, and a significantly lower risk profile for any project we undertake. Strains and fermentation processes must be efficiently optimized to enable cost-effective production; downstream recovery and purification processes must be identified and streamlined to achieve appropriate product purity and maximize facility throughput; and all unit operations must be tested for performance in appropriate scaled-down models before they are implemented at commercial scale manufacturing facilities. Our unique infrastructure to support this scale-up process includes hundreds of lab-scale fermentors (0.25 to 2 liter) and operating pilot plants in our facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil (multiple 300L and 1x 1000L fermentor), both of which are equipped with a wide range of downstream processing unit operations. In addition, five years of experience owning and operating the 1,200,000-liter production facility in Brotas, Brazil (sold in late 2017) enabled us to refine these scaled-down systems to mimic the commercial scale fermentation and recovery tools so that our findings may translate predictably from lab- and pilot-scale to commercial scale.
Manufacturing 
We are currently manufacturing our ingredients by using a strategic network of contract manufacturers in Brazil, the United States and Europe. Until December 2017, we owned and operated a biofuel-oriented production facility located in Brotas, Brazil, which we sold to DSM because it was no longer a strategic fit with our portfolio. We subsequently entered into a supply agreement with DSM to purchase intermediate product from the Brotas facility.
We are currently constructing a new, multi-line specialty ingredients manufacturing facility in Brazil. We expect construction to be completed in the first half of 2022, with initial production commencing shortly thereafter. Once fully commissioned, this facility will enable us to manufacture up to five products concurrently.
For many of our products, we perform additional distillation or finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products. We also have a manufacturing facility in Leland, North Carolina through Aprinnova, our joint venture with Nikko, to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products. See below under "Joint Ventures and Collaborations" for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture.
Product Distribution and Sales
We distribute and sell our sustainable consumer products to retailers and directly to consumers through online ecommerce web-sites. We distribute and sell our ingredients directly to distributors, formulators, collaboration partners, or through joint ventures, depending on the end-market. Generally, our R&D collaboration agreements include commercial terms, and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and/or commercial milestones.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from key customers and from all other customers was as follows, with DSM revenue mostly related to the F&F strategic transaction we completed during the first quarter of 2021:

(In thousands) | Renewable Products | Licenses and Royalties | Collaborations, Grants and Other | Total Revenue | % of Total Revenue
DSM (related party) | $ | 19,162 | | $ | 149,612 | $ | 6,000 | | $ | 174,774 | 51.1 | %
All other customers | 130,541 | | 24,200 | | 12,302 | 167,043 | | 48.9 | %
Total revenue | $ | 149,703 | | $ | 173,812 | $ | 18,302 | | $ | 341,817 | 100.0 | %

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and its foreign counterparts. We seek to avoid infringement by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 684 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 238 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are owned or co-owned by or licensed to us. We also use other forms of protection (such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret) to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position.
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant, and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by patents, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.”
We further protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Trademarks
Amyris, the Amyris logo, Biofene, Biossance, Costa Brazil, Hemisqualane, JVN, Lab-to-Market, No Compromise, OLIKA, Pipette, Purecane, Rose Inc., and Terasana are trademarks or registered trademarks of Amyris, Inc or its subsidiaries. This report also contains trademarks and trade names of other businesses that are the property of their respective holders. 
Competition
We expect that our products will compete with products produced from traditional sources as well as from alternative production methods (including the intellectual property underlying such methods) that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to develop and commercialize. We view competition principally as those products, typically based on traditional chemistries or are derived from non-sustainable sources that we are replacing with our sustainable products.
Clean Beauty & Personal Care
We develop and sell active cosmetic ingredients and consumer products in the Clean Beauty & Personal Care markets, creating a competitive landscape that includes ingredient suppliers, Clean Beauty & Personal Care and consumer goods companies. Most skincare ingredients are derived from plant and animal sources or created using chemical synthesis. Plant- and animal-sourced ingredients are typically higher in cost, lower in purity and have a greater impact on the environment versus our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Health & Wellness
Many active ingredients in the nutraceutical market are made via chemical synthesis by suppliers that have a deep chemistry know-how and production facilities, including ingredient suppliers. We may compete directly with these companies with respect to specific ingredients or attempt to provide customers with a natural alternative that is more cost effective or higher performing than those derived from chemistry. For food ingredients, we also compete with companies that produce products from plant- and animal-derived sources as well as with companies that are also developing biotechnology production solutions to produce specific molecules.
Flavor & Fragrance
The main competition in the F&F and cosmetic actives markets is from products derived from plant and animal sources as well as chemical synthesis. The products derived from plant and animal sources are typically produced at higher cost and lower purity, and create a greater impact on the environment compared to our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but may have ramifications on sustainability and on non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Competitive Factors
We believe the primary competitive factors in our target markets are:
•product performance and other measures of quality;
•product price;
•product cost;
•sustainability and social responsibility;
•dependability of naturally supplied ingredients; and
•infrastructure compatibility of products.
We believe that, for our products to succeed in the market, we must demonstrate that our products are comparable or better alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of performance, pricing, product cost, availability, and consumer preference characteristics.
Regulatory Matters
Environmental Regulations
Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States, Canada, Latin America (Brazil), Europe (UK), China and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. However, future developments including the commencement of or changes in the processes relating to commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may incur material costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to material liabilities.”
GMM Regulations
The use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), such as our yeast strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential industrial products produced from the GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is GRAS, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not 
limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. In Brazil, GMMs are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission (CTNBio) under its Biosafety Law No. 11.105-2005. We have obtained commercial approvals from CTNBio to use our GMMs in a contained environment in our Brazil facilities for research and development purposes, in manufacturing and at contract manufacturing facilities in Brazil. In Europe, we are subject to similar regulations and have obtained approvals from Spain’s Ministry of Environment for our production activities located in this country.
Chemical Regulations
Our renewable products may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a “Chemical Abstracts Service” number registration and Pre-Manufacture Notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH) regulation. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” In 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, which enables us to manufacture and sell Hemisqualane (Farnesane) without restriction in the United States. In 2016, Hemisqualane was similarly registered in Europe under REACH for manufacturing and sales. 
Other Regulations
Certain of our current or emerging products in the Clean Beauty & Personal Care, Health & Wellness, and F&F end markets, including alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, F&F ingredients, skincare ingredients, cosmetic actives, and our proposed cannabinoid products, are subject to regulation by either the FDA or the Drug Enforcement Administration or both, as well as similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are manufactured, sold or proposed to be sold. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of food ingredients, vitamins, and cosmetics. Generally, in order to be marketed and sold in the United States, a relevant product must be GRAS, approved and not adulterated or misbranded under the FDCA and relevant regulations issued thereunder. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA applicable to food ingredients, vitamins, drugs and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a recall of illegal products from the market, and to request the U.S. Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in U. S. courts. Failure to obtain requisite approval from, or comply with the laws and regulations of, the FDA or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from fully commercializing certain of our products. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” Our proposed cannabinoid products may also be subject to regulation under various federal, state and foreign-controlled substance laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors - Our cannabinoid and COVID-19 vaccine development initiatives are uncertain and may not yield commercial results and are subject to material regulatory risks.”
In addition, our direct-to-consumer products such as our Biossance, JVN, and Rose, Inc. products will be subject to the Natural Cosmetics/Personal Care Products Safety Act, if enacted. Cosmetic products are regulated by or under the FDA’s oversight. Also, our direct-to-consumer products are subject to the regulations of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are sold or proposed to be sold regarding the advertising of such products. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to cosmetics, including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees, injunctions, and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the FTC or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to market our direct-to-consumer products.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 980 full-time employees, of whom approximately 740 were in the United States, 140 were in Brazil, 50 were in Portugal, and 50 were in the United Kingdom. Except for labor union representation for Brazil-based employees based on labor code requirements in Brazil, none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal 
purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and consultants through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and, with respect to selected employees, cash-based performance bonus awards.
Diversity and Inclusion 
We are committed to enhancing the diversity of our workforce and promoting a culture of acceptance and equality throughout the organization. Our board of directors (Board) believes that human capital management, including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, are important to our success. We conduct an employee engagement survey on an annual basis, and the results of these surveys are discussed with the Leadership, Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of the Board, as well as with the executive leadership in order to continue to improve our DEI practices across the Company.
A Diverse Workforce: Our diversity makes us stronger. We strengthen the value we create as a company when we bring a broad-based workforce together to achieve our goals.
Promoting Inclusion: We promote employee affiliation groups focused on specific diverse needs of our workforce, and these diverse groups run their own programming to contribute to the education about, and to promote awareness of, their diversity. We believe these programs and related company-wide communications result in a more inclusive environment for our employees.
Equal Pay for Equal Work: We believe in compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We have instituted practices to ensure salary transparency, our management is guided on the principle of pay equity, and our compensation structures by job level and geographical market are available to all employees.
Health and Safety 
Safety is one of our core values, which means that maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for our people, as well as our communities, resources, and planet, is our highest priority. We have a Safety Committee that is responsible for developing, promoting, and maintaining safety policies and procedures. We provide customized environmental health and safety training, carry out regular facility audits, assist employees with risk assessments, promote waste management and reduction practices, provide recommended personal protective equipment and offer a robust ergonomics program in compliance with the California Division of Occupational Health and Safety and the California Department of Public Health.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to take both a short-term and a long-term view of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. Since early 2020, we have closely monitored the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including its impact on our employees, partners, supply chain, and distribution network. Since the start of the pandemic, we developed a comprehensive response strategy including establishing a cross-functional COVID-19 Task Force and implementing business continuity plans to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business. We have applied recommended public health strategies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and have been focused on the health and welfare of our employees. We have successfully managed to sustain ongoing critical production campaigns and infrastructure while staying in compliance with public health orders
