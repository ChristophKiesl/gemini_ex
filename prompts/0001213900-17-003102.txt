ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
GrowGeneration Corp. was incorporated in Colorado in 2014 in order to acquire 4 existing hydroponic supply stores. In the past year, we have grown into a chain of twelve (12) retail hydroponic/gardening stores, with ten (10) located in the state of Colorado, one (1) in the state of California and one (1) in the state of Nevada. The hydroponic/gardening industry is fragmented, in which typical retail stores are small family owned businesses, usually consisting of a single location. This is particularly true in Colorado, California and Nevada where we currently operate. We intend to open or acquire additional retail stores and increase and expand our footprint in these states.
Products
 
GrowGeneration stores offer essential supplies to the hydroponic and gardening industry, including medium (i.e., farming soil), industry-leading hydroponic equipment, power-efficient lighting, plant nutrients, and thousands of additional products used by professional growers and specialty cultivation operations. We offer our products through our retail stores. GrowGeneration is also actively seeking the establishment of a brand of private labeled products, which will be sold through GrowGeneration outlets.
Markets
 
GrowGeneration serves a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor and outdoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without having to compromise quality, regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions.
 
Our target market segments include home growers of organic vegetable and fruit Growers (small farms, home garden growers, restaurants growers, farmer markets), the Do-it Yourselfers (home flower and plant growers/ mass market and growers in the cannabis related market (Dispensaries, Cultivators, Caregivers).

Indoor growing techniques have primarily been used to cultivate plant-based medicines. Plant-based medicines often require high-degree of regulation and controls including government compliance, security, and crop consistency, making indoor growing techniques a preferred method. Cultivators of plant-based medicines often make a significant investment to design and build-out their facilities. They look to work with companies such as GrowGeneration that understand their specific needs and can help mitigate risks that could jeopardize their crops. Plant-based medicines are believed to be among the fastest-growing market in the U.S. and several industry pundits believe that plant-based medicines may even displace prescription pain medication by providing patients with a safer, more affordable alternative.
 
Indoor growing techniques, however, are not limited to plant-based medicines. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables are beginning to emerge in the market due to a rising shortage of farmland, and environmental vulnerabilities including drought, other severe weather conditions and insect pests. Indoor growing techniques enable cultivators to grow crops all-year-round in urban areas, and take up less ground while minimizing environmental risks. Indoor growing techniques typically require a more significant upfront investment to design and build-out these facilities than traditional farmlands. If new innovations lower the costs for indoor growing, and the costs to operate traditional farmlands continue to rise, then indoor growing techniques may be a compelling alternative for the broader agricultural industry.
 
Research and Development

The company has not incurred any research and development expenses during the period covered by this report.


Customers and Suppliers
 
Our key customers vary by state and are expected to be more defined as the company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing activity. Currently, none of our customers accounted for more than 5% of our sales.
 
Our key suppliers include distributors such as HydroFarm, BWGS and Sunlight Supply to product specific suppliers such as Emerald Harvest, General Hydroponics and Can Fan USA. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to indoor and outdoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines.
 
Demand for Products
 
Demand for indoor and outdoor growing equipment is currently high due to legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily Cannabis, which is mainly due to equipment purchases for build-out and repeat purchases of consumable nutrients needed during the growing period. This demand is projected to continue to grow as a result of the supporting state laws in 28 states and the District of Columbia. Continued innovation and more efficient build-out technologies along with larger and consolidated cultivation facilities is expected to further expand market demand for GrowGeneration products and services. We expect the market to continue to segment into urban farmers serving groups of individuals, community cultivators, and large-scale cultivation facilities across the states. Each segment will be optimized to different distribution channels that GrowGeneration currently provides. We are of the opinion that as our volume increases, we will obtain volume discounts on purchasing that should allow us to maximize both our revenues and gross margins.
 
E-Commerce Strategy
 
The Company is developing its e-commerce website and portal, www.growgeneration.com. The site plans to offer for sale hydroponic, specialty and organic gardening products. Online shoppers are able to shop from product departments, from nutrients to lighting to hydroponic and greenhouse equipment, delivering an easy and quick method to find the products that they want to purchase. Our e-commerce site has been designed to appeal to both the professional grower, as well as the home gardener/hobbyist. Each product listed on the site contains product descriptions, product reviews and a picture so the consumer can make an informed and educated purchase. Our product filters allow the consumer to search by brand, manufacturer, or by function such as wattage. Designed as an information portal as well as an e-commerce store, the consumer will find videos, articles, blogs and other relevant content, all generated by Grow Generation’s internal staff, which we call our “Grow Pros”. The GrowGeneration shopper will be able to shop online 24/7 and, if they choose order online and receive products directly to their grow operation or home, order online and pick up at one of the GrowGeneration retail stores, or simply use our site as a resource and shop with our Grow Pros at one of our retail locations. Google advertising, social media and in store advertising are the primary advertising tools we will use to drive traffic to www.growgeneration.com

Goals and Strategy
 
Our goal is to become one of the nation's largest providers of equipment and supplies for growing organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines. We intend to achieve our goal by implementing the following strategies:
 
1. Engage with cultivation facilities and secure exclusive supplier contracts;
 2. Own, operate and expand regional retail stores to service and support the operations of professional and home growers;
 3. Develop and grow our e-commerce platform;
 4. Establish a national sales team;
 5. Establish a brand of “house” or white-labeled products which we would sell exclusively;
 6. Assemble the most knowledgeable staff and leadership team; and
 7. Acquire additional products and services that are essential to our customers and deliver high-margins.
 
Competition
 
Our key competitors include many local and national vendors of gardening supplies, local product resellers of hydroponic and other specialty growing equipment, as well as online product resellers and large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com and EBay. Our industry, generally referred to “Hydroponic Gardening Stores”, is a highly fragmented industry with over 1,000 retail outlets throughout the U.S. The industry is highly competitive. We compete with companies that have greater capital resources, facilities and diversity of product lines. Additionally, if demand for our hydroponic growing equipment continues to grow and if the cannabis industry continues to develop, we expect many new competitors to enter the market, as there are no significant barriers to retail sales of hydroponic growing equipment. More established hydroponic companies with much greater financial resources which do not currently compete with us may be able to easily adapt their existing operations to sales of hydroponic growing equipment. Increased competition may lead to reduced prices and/or margins for products we sell. Our competitors may also introduce new hydroponic growing equipment, manufacturers may sell equipment direct to consumers, and our distributers could cease sales of product to us.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do believe that our pricing, inventory and product availability and overall customer service provide us with the ability to compete in this marketplace. In addition, as we increase our number of stores and inventory per store, we expect to be able to purchase larger amounts of inventory at lower volume sale prices, which we expect will enable us to price competitively and deliver the products that our customers are seeking. We also believe, that the consistency of a national brand and operating in multiple states, will give our customers confidence to shop with us.
 
Based on our knowledge and communication with our suppliers, we do not believe our suppliers sell directly to the retail market or our customers.


Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
Our intellectual property consists of our brands and their related trademarks, domain names and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles. We also hold rights to website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.GrowGeneration.com. We own the federally registered trademark for “GrowGeneration”. We also own a federal register trademark “Where the Pros Go to Grow”.
 
We have a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and some of our vendors and customers as necessary.
 
Government Regulation
 
While there is no governmental regulation relating to the sale of hydroponic equipment or soil and nutrients that we sell, there are laws and regulations governing the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related products. Currently, there are over 28 states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. About a dozen other states are considering legislation to similar effect. As of the date of this report, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of GrowGeneration to invest in or buy products from GrowGeneration. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly or indirectly adversely affect GrowGeneration operations.
