Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Banyan is a shell company without significant operations. Our management team is investigating potential operating companies to acquire and additional sources of financing. Currently we are seeking acquisitions of active companies within various industries throughout North America, but we cannot guarantee we will complete an acquisition.
 
During 2016, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Banyan Medical Partners, LLC (“BMP”), and certain other subsidiaries wholly-owned by BMP. The purpose of these companies was to acquire medical office buildings in the United States. The Company was unable to raise the capital needed to consummate the first medical building opportunity. On March 9, 2017, the Company sold its wholly owned subsidiary, BMP and BMP’s wholly owned subsidiaries to Patriot Equity, LLC, a limited liability company owned solely by Gary O. Marino, the Company’s chairman of the board.
 
Our History
 
The Company was originally organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1985, for the purpose of investing in mortgage loans. The Company was reorganized as a Delaware corporation in 1987. From 1989 to 1992 the Company experienced severe losses as a result of a decline in real estate values and the resulting defaults on the mortgages it held. In 1998, the Company changed its name to B.H.I.T. Inc., and again changed its name to Banyan Rail Services Inc. in 2010. From 2009 to 2012, the Company operated and experienced severe losses from an operating subsidiary in the rail services sector and is now a shell company.
