ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our mission is to provide simple useful services that help people unlock the power of the Internet.
 
We accomplish this by reducing the complexity of our customers’ experience as they access the Internet (at home or on the go) and while using Internet services such as domain name registration, email and other Internet services. We are organized, managed and report our financial results as two segments, Network Access Services and Domain Services, which are differentiated primarily by their services, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate.
 
Our management regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we utilize our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. To assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies, our management regularly reviews revenue for each of our service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business. Accordingly, we report Network Access Services and Domain Services revenue separately.
 
We redefined our reporting segments and our key measure of performance effective January 1, 2021 as a result of the increased separation between our mobile and fiber product offerings as well as the increased delineation between the operations supporting certain product offerings planned in 2021.
 
Effective January 1, 2021, Tucows will adjust its segment reporting to include adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of segment performance in addition to its existing key measure of segment performance, gross profit. 
 
Also effective January 1, 2021, The operating results of our existing Network Access segment will be separated into two separate segments, the Mobile segment and the Fiber segment. The new Mobile segment will contain our Mobile Services Enabler ("MSE") and professional services product offerings as well as the retail sale of mobile phones and retail telephony services. The Fiber segment will contain the operating results of our retail high speed Internet access operations. The product offerings included in the Domain Services segment will remain unchanged. 
 
   
  

Network Access Services
 
Network Access Services includes retail mobile services, mobile platform and professional services supporting Mobile Virtual Network Operators ("MVNOs"), fixed high-speed Internet access services and other revenues, including billing solutions to small Internet service providers (“ISPs”).
 
Historically, the Company offered retail mobile services (“Ting Mobile”) through the Ting website and to a lesser extent through certain third-party retail stores and online retailers. We generated revenues from the sale of retail telephony services, mobile phone hardware and related accessories to individuals and small businesses through the Ting website. Ting Mobile’s primary focus was providing simple and easy to use services, including simple value pricing, in particular for multi-line accounts, and superior customer care. This continued until August 1, 2020, when the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiary Ting, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with DISH Wireless LLC ("DISH") pursuant to which Ting sold substantially all of its retail mobile customer relationships, and mobile handset and SIM inventory to DISH and granted DISH the right to use and an option to purchase the Ting brand. The transferred assets under the Purchase Agreement do not include the technology platforms and related intellectual property and infrastructure necessary to enable or support the mobile customers. The Company has retained the assets used to provide the MSE platform and other professional services to DISH, as discussed further below. The residual revenues and costs associated with retail mobile services in the months following the entry into the Purchase Agreement represent the telephony services, mobile phone hardware and related accessories sold to the small subset of customer relationships retained by the Company that were not part of the Purchase Agreement. These customers are limited to one MNO agreement that was not assigned to DISH. The Company will retain customer accounts associated with the excluded MNO, and the minimum revenue commitments under the excluded MNO contract. The Company will be able to continue adding customers under the excluded MNO contract working with DISH in order to meet the commitment. 
 
Historically, the Company also operated other MVNO brands, ZipSim and Always Online Wireless (collectively referred to as the “Roam Mobility brands”). The Roam Mobility brands operated as an MVNO on the same nationwide Global System for Mobile communications (“GSM”) network used by Ting Mobile and distributed through third-party retail stores and product branded websites. The primary focus of the Roam Mobility brands was to offer affordable roaming service to those travelling throughout the United States or Internationally. In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business and leisure travel industries, demand for SIM-enabled roaming services early in the fiscal year ("Fiscal") ending December 31, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020") decreased significantly. As a result of the current and expected longer term reduction of business and leisure travel, the Company decided to shut down the operations of the Roam Mobility brands in June 2020, which was completed by September 30, 2020. 
 
Although we still provide retail mobile services to a small subset of customers retained through the Ting Mobile brand, this service offering no longer represents the Company's strategic focus for Mobile Services going forward. Instead, we have transitioned away from a MVNO and towards a MSE, where we will focus on delivering a wide range of functions including billing, activation, provisioning, funnel marketing, and other professional services to mobile providers. Contemporaneously with the execution of the Purchase Agreement with DISH, the Company executed a Mobile Services Enabler Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with DISH with to provide certain back-office enabling services in support of DISH's MVNO operations in the United States. The MSA has a four-year term effective August 1, 2020, with an automatic one-year extension upon achievement of certain milestones, and monthly per subscriber tiered rates. DISH is now the first Tucows MSE customer.  Under the terms of the MSA, the Company is permitted to sell MSE services to other third parties.  
 
The Company also derives revenue from the sale of fixed high-speed Internet access (“Ting Internet”) in select communities throughout the United States, including towns in North Carolina, Maryland, Idaho, Colorado, Virginia, and California with further expansion underway to both new and existing Ting towns. Our primarily sales channel of Ting Internet is through the Ting website. The primary focus of Ting Internet is to provide reliable Gigabit Internet services to consumer and business customers. On January 1, 2020, the Company closed its acquisition of Cedar Holdings Group ("Cedar"). Cedar is a telecommunications provider serving multiple markets in the Western Slope of Colorado and northwestern New Mexico. Cedar has focused the last several years on building fiber to enterprise, anchor institution, and residential customers.
 
Revenues from our retail mobile services, MSE business and Ting Internet are all generated in the U.S. and are provided on a monthly basis. Ting Internet services have no fixed contract terms, while our MSE customer agreements have set contract lengths with the underlying MVNO.

Domain Services
 
Domain Services includes wholesale and retail domain name registration services, value added services and portfolio services derived through our OpenSRS, eNom, Ascio and Hover brands. We earn revenues primarily from the registration fees charged to resellers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations. In addition, we earn revenues from the sale of retail domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses. Domain Services revenues are attributed to the country in which the contract originates, which is primarily in Canada and the U.S. for OpenSRS and eNom brands. Ascio domain services contracts and EPAG agreements primarily originate in Europe.
 
Our primary distribution channel is a global network of approximately 36,000 resellers that operate in approximately 160 countries and who typically provide their customers, the end-users of Internet-based services, with solutions for establishing and maintaining an online presence. Our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing the broadest portfolio of gTLD and the country code top-level domain (“ccTLD”) options and related services, a white-label platform that facilitates the provisioning and management of domain names, a powerful Application Program Interface, easy-to-use interfaces, comprehensive management and reporting tools, and proactive and attentive customer service. Our services are integral to the solutions that our resellers deliver to their customers. We provide “second tier” support to our resellers by email, chat and phone in the event resellers experience issues or problems with our services. In addition, our Network Operating Center proactively monitors all services and network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted.
 
We believe that the underlying platforms for our services are among the most mature, reliable and functional reseller-oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry, and we continue to refine, evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end-users. Our business model is characterized primarily by non-refundable, up-front payments, which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow.
 
Wholesale, primarily branded as OpenSRS, eNom, EPAG and Ascio, derives revenue from its domain registration service and from providing value-added services. The OpenSRS, eNom, EPAG and Ascio domain services manage 25.4 million domain names under the Tucows, eNom, EPAG and Ascio ICANN registrar accreditations and for other registrars under their own accreditations, which has increased by 1.6 million domain names since December 31, 2019. The increase is driven by increased registrations during COVID-19, as more businesses established an online presence, offset by the continued erosion of registrations related to non-core customers from our eNom brand.
 
Value-added services include hosted email which provides email delivery and webmail access to millions of mailboxes, Internet security services, Internet hosting, WHOIS privacy, publishing tools and other value-added services. All of these services are made available to end-users through a network of 36,000 web hosts, ISPs and other resellers around the world. In addition, we also derive revenue by monetizing domain names which are near the end of their lifecycle through advertising revenue or auction sale.
 
Retail, primarily the Hover and eNom portfolio of websites, including eNom, eNom Central and Bulkregister, derive revenues from the sale of domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses. Our retail domain services also includes our Personal Names Service – based on over 36,000 surname domains – that allows roughly two-thirds of Americans to purchase an email address based on their last name.
 
Portfolio services generate revenue by offering names in our surname domain portfolio for resale through our RealNames email service. The Company expects portfolio revenue to decline into 2021 and starting in the first quarter of 2021 will no longer separately breakout Portfolio revenues.

Net Revenues
 
Network Access Services
 
The Company generates Network Access Services revenues primarily through the provisioning of retail mobile services, mobile platform and professional services supporting MVNOs, fixed high-speed Internet access services and other revenues, including billing solutions to small ISPs.
Mobile Services - Retail Mobile Services
 
  Ting Mobile wireless usage contracts grant customers access to standard talk, text and data mobile services. Ting Mobile contracts are billed based on the customer's selected rate plan, which can be either usage based or an unlimited plan. All rate plan options are charged to customers on a postpaid, monthly basis at the end of their billing cycle. As discussed above, on August 1, 2020, the Company and its wholly owned Subsidiary Ting, Inc. entered into the Purchase Agreement with DISH pursuant to which Ting sold substantially all of its retail mobile customer relationships, and mobile handset and SIM inventory to DISH and granted the right to use and option to purchase the Ting brand. Select MNO agreements previously established to operate the Ting Mobile MVNO business were assigned to DISH as part of this Purchase Agreement. We retained a small subset of customers to which we continue to provide retail mobile services. All future revenues associated with Retail Mobile Services stream will only be for this subset of customers retained by the Company.
 
  Ting Mobile services are primarily contracted through the Ting website, for one month at a time and contain no commitment to renew the contract following each customer's monthly billing cycle. The Company's billing cycle for all Ting Mobile customers is computed based on the customer's activation date. In order to recognize revenue as the Company satisfies its obligations, we compute the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period. In addition, revenues associated with the sale of wireless devices and accessories are recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer and shipment has occurred. Incentive marketing credits given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
 
  As part of the Purchase Agreement, as a form of consideration for the sale of the customer relationships, the Company receives a payout on the margin associated with the legacy customer base sold to DISH, over a period of 10 years. This has been classified as Other Income and not considered revenue in the current period as it represents the payout from a one-time sale and is not considered a part of our core business operations with the shift from MVNO to MSE.  
 
  The Company also operated the Roam Mobility brands historically and, in June 2020, decided to shut down the businesses due to the considerable lack of demand for SIM-enabled roaming services as a result of the limited business and leisure travel brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown was completed by September 30, 2020. Our Roam Mobility brands offered standard talk, text and data mobile services. Roam customers prepaid for their usage through the Roam Mobility website. When prepayments were received the amount was deferred, and subsequently recognized as the Company satisfies its obligation to provide mobile services. In addition, revenues associated with the sale of SIM cards were recognized when title and risk of loss was transferred to the subscriber and shipment occurred. Incentive marketing credits given to customers were recorded as a reduction of revenue.
 
Mobile Services - Mobile Platform Services
 
  Tucows' MSE platform provides network access, provisioning and billing services for MVNOs. These platform fees are billed to our MVNO customers monthly, on a postpaid basis. Currently, we have one MSE platform customer - DISH, but intend to expand this service to other MVNOs in the future. The fees are based on the volume of their subscribers utilizing the platform during a given month. The Company recognizes revenue over this new revenue stream as the Company satisfies its obligations to provide MSE services on a monthly basis. For any bundled professional services where proceeds are collected before the service period as part of MSE Platform Revenues, the professional services revenue is initially deferred and recognized only as the Company performs its obligation to provide professional services. 
Mobile Services - Other Professional Services
 
  This revenue stream includes any other professional services, including transitional services, earned in connection with Tucows' new MSE business. These are billed to our customers monthly at set and established rates for services provided in the applicable period. Currently, we have one professional services customer - DISH, but intend to expand this service to other MVNOs in the future.  The Company recognizes revenue over this new revenue stream as the Company satisfies its obligations to provide professional services.
Fiber Internet Services
 
  Fiber Internet Services derive revenues from providing Ting Internet to individuals and small businesses in select cities. In addition, we provide billing, provisioning and customer care software solutions to ISPs through our Platypus billing software. Ting Internet access contracts provide customers Internet access at their home or business through the installation and use of our fiber optic network. Ting Internet contracts are generally prepaid and grant customers with unlimited bandwidth based on a fixed price per month basis. Since consideration is collected before the service period, revenue is initially deferred and recognized as the Company performs its obligation to provide Internet access.
 
  Ting Internet services are primarily contracted through the Ting website, for one month at a time and contain no commitment to renew the contract following each customer’s monthly billing cycle. The Company’s billing cycle for all Ting Internet access customers is computed based on the customer’s activation date. In order to recognize revenue as the Company satisfies its obligations, we compute the amount of revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period. In addition, revenues associated with the sale of Internet hardware to subscribers are recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to the subscriber and shipment has occurred. Incentive marketing credits given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
 
  In those cases, where payment is not received at the time of sale, revenue is not recognized until contract inception unless the collection of the related accounts receivable is reasonably assured. The Company records costs that reflect expected refunds, rebates and credit card charge-backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations.

Domain Services
 
Wholesale - Domain Services
 
  Domain registration contracts, which can be purchased for terms of one to ten years, provide our resellers and retail registrant customers with the exclusive right to a personalized internet address from which to build an online presence. The Company enters into domain registration contracts in connection with each new, renewed and transferred-in domain registration. At the inception of the contract, the Company charges and collects the registration fee for the entire registration period. Though fees are collected upfront, revenue from domain registrations are recognized rateably over the registration period as domain registration contracts contain a ‘right to access’ license of IP, which is a distinct performance obligation measured over time. The registration period begins once the Company has confirmed that the requested domain name has been appropriately recorded in the registry under contractual performance standards.
 
  Historically, our wholesale domain service has constituted the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration, renewal, transfer and management of domain names. In addition, this service fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a reseller will engage us, enabling us to follow on with other services and allowing us to add to our portfolio by purchasing names registered through us upon their expiration. We expect Domain services will continue to be the largest portion of our business and will continue to enable us to sell add-on services.
 
  The Company is an ICANN accredited registrar. Thus, the Company is the primary obligor with our reseller and retail registrant customers and is responsible for the fulfillment of our registrar services to those parties. As a result, the Company reports revenue in the amount of the fees we receive directly from our reseller and retail registrant customers. Our reseller customers maintain the primary obligor relationship with their retail customers, establish pricing and retain credit risk to those customers. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize any revenue related to transactions between our reseller customers and their ultimate retail customers.
 
Wholesale – Value-Added Services
 
  We derive revenue from domain related value-added services like digital certifications, WHOIS privacy and hosted email and by providing our resellers and retail registrant customers with tools and additional functionality to be used in conjunction with domain registrations. All domain related value-added services are considered distinct performance obligations which transfer the promised service to the customer over the contracted term. Fees charged to customers for domain related value-added services are collected at the inception of the contract, and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contracted term, consistent with the satisfaction of the performance obligations.
 
  We also derive revenue from other value-added services, which primarily consists of Internet hosting services on the OpenSRS and eNom domain expiry streams.
 
Retail 
 
  We derive revenues from Hover and eNom’s retail properties through the sale of retail domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses.
 
Portfolio
 
  The Company sells the rights to its portfolio of surname domains used in its RealNames email service. Revenue generated from sale of domain name contracts, containing a distinct performance obligation to transfer the domain name rights under the Company’s control, is generally recognized once the rights have been transferred and payment has been received in full. Domain portfolio names are sold through our RealNames email service. The Company expects portfolio revenue to decline into 2021 and starting in the first quarter of 2021 will no longer separately breakout Portfolio revenues.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we are well positioned in the wholesale domain registration and email markets due in part to our highly-recognized “Tucows”, “OpenSRS”, “Ascio” and “eNom” brands and the respect they confer on us as a defender of end-user rights and reseller-friendly approaches to doing business. We were among the first group of 34 registrars to be accredited by ICANN in 1999, and we remain active in Internet governance issues.
 
Our success and ability to compete depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our brand name and technology. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
We have registered the Tucows trademark in the United States, Canada and the European Union and we register additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate and where such protection is available.
 
We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring all employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to commit to confidentiality, non-disclosure and work-for-hire agreements. All of our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-use agreements, which provide that any rights they may have in copyrightable works or patentable technologies accrue to us. Before entering into discussions with potential vendors and partners about our business and technologies, we require them to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. If these discussions result in a license or other business relationship, we also generally require that the agreement containing the parties’ rights and obligations include provisions for the protection of its intellectual property rights.
 
Customers
 
The majority of the customers to whom we provide reseller services are generally either web hosts or ISPs. A small number of customers are consultants and designers providing our services to their business clients. Both our Retail Domain Services and our Network Access Services customers are a very broad mix of consumers, small businesses and corporations. We have a singular customer in DISH for our MSE Platform and Other Professional Services, until such time we expand these offerings to other MVNOs.
 
No customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.
 
While web hosts and ISPs are capitalizing on the growth in Internet usage and the demand for new services, they also face significant competition from numerous other service providers with competitive or comparable offerings. This has led such web hosts and ISPs to focus on core competencies. As such resellers are increasingly seeking to outsource non-core services. Outsourcing enables these resellers to better focus on customer acquisition and retention efforts by eliminating the need to own, develop and support non-core applications in-house.
 
Seasonality
 
During the summer months and certain other times of the year, such as major holidays, Internet usage often declines. As a result, some of our services (such as OpenSRS, eNom, Ascio, and Hover) may experience reduced demand during these times. For example, our experience shows that new domain registrations decline during the summer months and around the year-end holidays.  
Competition
 
Our competitors may be divided into the following groups:
 

• | US Broadband providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and CenturyLink, who primarily compete with Ting Internet Services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Retail-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy and Web.com who compete with our Reseller customers in wholesale domain services and with Hover.
• | Wholesale-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy, who market services to resellers such as our customers. 
• | Wholesale Email Service providers, such as Google, Microsoft, Bluetie and MailTrust. 

 
We expect to continue to experience significant competition from the competitors identified above and, as our business continues to develop, we expect to encounter competition from other providers. Service providers, Internet portals, web hosting companies, email hosting companies, outsourced application companies, country code registries and major telecommunication firms may broaden their services to include services we offer.
 
    7 

  

We believe the primary competitive factors in our Network Access Services are:
 

• | Providing a superior customer service experience 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Providing a simple and friendly user experience through more usable web and application interfaces and more fair and transparent pricing;
• | Being agnostic on internet hardware, including network routers; and 
• | Providing superior technology, speed and reliability with fiber to the home services. 

 
We believe the primary competitive factors in our Domain Services are:
 

• | Providing superior customer service by anticipating the technical requirements and business objectives of resellers and providing them with technical advice to help them understand how our services can be customized to meet their particular needs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Providing cost savings over in-house solutions by relieving resellers of the expense of acquiring and maintaining hardware and software and the associated administrative burden; 
• | Enabling resellers to better manage their relationships with their end-users; 
• | Facilitating scalability through an infrastructure designed to support millions of transactions across millions of end-users; and 
• | Providing superior technology and infrastructure, consisting of industry-leading software and hardware that allow resellers to provide these services to their customers without having to make substantial investments in their own software or hardware.

 
Although we encounter pricing pressure in many markets in which we compete, we believe the effects of that pressure are mitigated by the fact that we deliver a high degree of value to our customers through our business and technical practices. We believe our status as a trusted supplier also allows us to mitigate the effects of this type of competition. We believe that the long-term relationships we have made with many customers results in a sense of certainty that would not be available to those customers through a competitor.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As a global Internet and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, and call center employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 800 full-time employees globally. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Approximately 67% of our employees are based in Canada, followed by 26% based in the U.S., and the remaining 7% spread across Europe and other regions. Of our employees, approximately 450 support our Network Access Services segment, while approximately 350 support our Domains Services segment. Our employees perform work in a variety of environments, including customers’ homes or businesses, in the field, in corporate offices or remotely from their own home offices. For the small group of employees who are unable work from home during this time, including our order fulfillment and Fiber installation teams, many of whom work in the field, they are encouraged to practice social distancing and to continue to follow hygiene best practices and safety protocols as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As a response to the pandemic, we have established an Fiber Internet install solution for our employees and customers that minimizes risks associated with person-to-person contact. We expect our work from home policy to remain in effect until emergency state and governmental declarations where we have physical offices have ended and we believe the risk of community spread of the disease has subsided. Given our experience with remote work prior to COVID-19, we have not and do not expect to have productivity issues while the overwhelming majority of our office-based workforce is dispersed. We ground ourselves in being open, human, real and smart and we believe this corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork across the organization and is a critical contributor to our success. We offer competitive compensation in addition employee stock options, physical and mental health benefits, learning allowances, future planning programs for employee RRSP/401k contributions, as well as generous vacation, maternity, paternity and adoption leaves for our employees. We also support five Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") focused on BIPOC, caregivers, LGBTQA, racial justice and equality, and women leadership. These volunteer groups connect employees with shared characteristics, life experiences and enable them to engage in activities that advance our culture and contribute to our success.

Compliance with Government Regulations 
 
Network Access Services
 
Our Network Access Services segment is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), federal and other state laws in the U.S. These include:
 
The FCC and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
 
Our Fiber Internet services are also subject to a number of regulations and commitments. The FCC frequently considers imposing new broadband-related regulations such as those relating to an Open Internet. States and localities also consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks, net neutrality and connectivity during COVID-19. Additionally, as an internet service provider (“ISP”), we must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. From time to time, the FCC considers imposing new regulatory obligations on ISPs. We are committed to an Open Internet and do not block, throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle or discriminate against lawful content. 
 
Domain Services
 
Our Domain Services segment is subject to regulation by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we do business. These include:
ICANN: The registration of domain names is governed by ICANN. ICANN is a multi-stakeholder private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including management of the DNS, allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for all of these functions. Tucows, eNom, EPAG and Ascio are each individually accredited by ICANN as domain name registrars and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with, and accreditation by, ICANN. 
Country Code Top-Level Domain ("ccTLD") Authorities: The regulation of ccTLDs is governed by national regulatory agencies of the country underlying the specific ccTLDs, such as Canada (.ca). Our ability to sell ccTLDs is dependent on our ability to maintain accreditation in good standing with these various international authorities.
Communications Decency Act ("CDA"): The CDA generally protects online service providers, such as Tucows, from liability for certain activities of their customers, such as posting of defamatory or obscene content, unless the online service provider is participating in the unlawful conduct. Notwithstanding the general protections from liability under the CDA, we may nonetheless be forced to defend ourselves from claims of liability covered by the CDA, resulting in an increased cost of doing business.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”): The DMCA provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. Under the DMCA, we generally are not liable for infringing content posted by third parties. However, if we receive a proper notice from a copyright owner alleging infringement of its protected works by web pages for which we provide hosting services, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material, fail to post and enforce a digital rights management policy or a policy to terminate accounts of repeat infringers, or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor under the DMCA, the owner may seek to impose liability on us.
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”): GDPR creates obligations around the procurement, processing, publication and sharing of personal data. Potential fines for violations of certain provisions of GDPR reach as high as 4% of a company’s annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of its international affiliates. The solutions we develop for GDPR-compliance may not be adequate in the views of regulatory authorities or ICANN, which may cause the loss of WHOIS privacy revenue or increase our costs of developing compliant solutions or subject us to litigation, liability, civil penalties, or loss of market share. As the privacy laws and regulations around the world continue to evolve, these changes could adversely affect our business operations in similar ways
 
Several bodies of law may be deemed to apply to us with respect to various customer activities. Because we operate in a relatively new and rapidly evolving industry and since our industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and in new and growing illegal activity, these bodies of laws are constantly evolving. As a host of content through our Exact Hosting business, and to a lesser extent as a registrar of domain names services we may be subject to potential liability for illegal activities by our resellers’ customers on their websites. We provide an automated service that enables users to register domain names. We do not monitor or review, nor does our accreditation agreement with ICANN require that we monitor or review, the appropriateness of the domain names we register for our customers or the content of their websites, and we have no control over the activities in which these customers engage. While we have policies in place to terminate domain names or to take other action if presented with evidence of illegal conduct, customers could nonetheless engage in prohibited activities without our knowledge..
