Item 1.BUSINESS
Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, with its subsidiaries (“Cooper” or the “Company”), is a leading manufacturer and marketer of replacement tires. It is the fifth largest tire manufacturer in North America and, according to a recognized trade source, the Cooper family of companies is the thirteenth largest tire company in the world based on sales. Cooper specializes in the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of passenger car, light truck, truck and bus radial ("TBR"), motorcycle and racing tires.
The Company is organized into four business segments: North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Each segment is managed separately. Additional information on the Company’s segments as reported, including their financial results, total assets, products, markets and presence in particular geographic areas, appears in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Business Segments” note to the consolidated financial statements.
Cooper Tire & Rubber Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1930 as the successor to a business originally founded in 1914. Based in Findlay, Ohio, Cooper and its family of companies currently operate in 15 countries, including 10 manufacturing facilities and 19 distribution centers.
On February 22, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (“Goodyear”) and Vulcan Merger Sub Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Goodyear (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permissible) waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Goodyear will acquire the Company by way of the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Goodyear. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, the Company’s stockholders will be entitled to receive $41.75 per share in cash and a fixed exchange ratio of 0.907 shares of Goodyear common stock per share of the Company’s common stock they own at the effective time. Upon completion of the proposed Merger, it is expected that the Company’s stockholders will own approximately 16 percent and Goodyear stockholders will own approximately 84 percent of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. The Company expects to complete the Merger in the second half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and the approval of the Company’s stockholders. See the discussion under “The Merger” in Item 7 for additional information.
Business Segments
The Company has four segments under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segments”:
•North America, composed of the Company’s operations in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada;
•Latin America, composed of the Company’s operations in Mexico, Central America and South America;
•Europe; and
•Asia.
North America and Latin America meet the criteria for aggregation in accordance with ASC 280, as they are similar in their production and distribution processes and exhibit similar economic characteristics. The aggregated North America and Latin America segments are presented as “Americas Tire Operations” in the segment disclosure.
Both the Europe and Asia segments have been determined to be individually immaterial, as they do not meet the quantitative requirements for segment disclosure under ASC 280. In accordance with ASC 280, information about operating segments that are not reportable shall be combined and disclosed in an all other category separate from other reconciling items. As a result, these two segments have been combined in the segment operating results discussion. The results of the combined Europe and Asia segments are presented as “International Tire Operations” in the segment disclosure.
Americas Tire Operations Segment
The Americas Tire Operations segment manufactures and markets passenger car and light truck tires, primarily for sale in the U.S. replacement market. The segment also has a manufacturing operation in Mexico, Corporacion de Occidente SA de CV (“COOCSA”), which supplies passenger car and light truck tires to the Mexican, North American, Central American and South American markets. On January 24, 2020, the Company acquired the remaining noncontrolling ownership interest in COOCSA, making COOCSA a wholly-owned subsidiary. The segment also markets and distributes racing, TBR and motorcycle tires. The racing and motorcycle tires are manufactured by the Company’s European segment and by others. TBR tires are sourced from China-based Qingdao Ge Rui Da Rubber Co., Ltd. ("GRT"), a majority-owned joint venture manufacturing facility, and ACTR Company Limited ("ACTR"), a 35 percent owned joint venture in Vietnam, and through off-take agreements with Prinx Chengshan (Shandong) Tire Company Ltd. ("PCT") and Sailun Vietnam. 
Major distribution channels and customers include independent tire dealers, wholesale distributors, regional and national retail tire chains, large retail chains that sell tires as well as other automotive products, mass merchandisers and digital channels. The 
-4-


segment does not currently sell its products directly to end users, except through three Company-owned retail stores. The segment sells a limited number of tires to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). 
The segment operates in a highly competitive industry, which includes Bridgestone Corporation, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Groupe Michelin and other domestic and international companies. These competitors are substantially larger than the Company and serve OEMs as well as the replacement tire market. The segment also faces competition from low-cost producers in Asia, Mexico, South America and Central Europe. Some of those producers are foreign affiliates of the segment’s competitors in North America. The segment had a market share in 2020 of approximately 10 percent of all passenger car and light truck replacement tire sales in the U.S. The segment also participates in the U.S. TBR tire market. A portion of the products manufactured by the segment are exported throughout the world.
Success in competing for the sale of replacement tires is dependent upon many factors, the most important of which are price, quality, performance, brand, line coverage, availability through appropriate distribution channels and relationships with dealers and retailers. Other factors include warranty, credit terms and other value-added programs. The segment has built close working relationships through the years with independent dealers. It believes those relationships have enabled it to obtain a competitive advantage in that channel of the market. As a steadily increasing percentage of replacement tires are sold by large regional and national tire retailers, as well as mass merchandisers, the segment has increased focus on its penetration of those distribution channels, while maintaining its traditionally strong network of independent dealers. The segment is also active in various other sales channels, including digital channels and others.
The segment’s replacement tire business has a broad customer base that includes purchasers of proprietary brand tires that are marketed and distributed by the Company and private label tires which are manufactured by the Company but marketed and distributed by the Company’s customers.
International Tire Operations Segment
The International Tire Operations segment is the combination of the Europe and Asia operating segments. The European operations include manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and the Republic of Serbia (“Serbia”). The U.K. entity primarily manufactures and markets motorcycle and racing tires and tire retread material for domestic and global markets. The Serbian entity manufactures passenger car and light truck tires primarily for the European markets and for export to the North American segment. The Asian operations are located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Vietnam. Cooper Kunshan Tire, in the PRC, manufactures passenger car and light truck tires both for the Chinese domestic market and for export to markets outside of the PRC. GRT, a joint venture manufacturing facility located in the PRC, and ACTR, a joint venture manufacturing facility located in Vietnam, serve as global sources of TBR tire production for the Company. The segment also procured certain TBR tires under off-take agreements with PCT and Sailun Vietnam. The segment sells a majority of its tires in the replacement market, with a portion also sold to OEMs. 
On January 17, 2019, Cooper Tire & Rubber Company Europe Ltd. (“Cooper Tire Europe”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, committed to a plan to cease substantially all passenger car and light truck tire production ("light vehicle tire production") at its Melksham, U.K. facility. The phasing out of light vehicle tire production was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2019. Approximately 300 roles were eliminated at the site. Cooper Tire Europe now obtains light vehicle tires to meet customer needs from other production sites within the Company’s global production network. Approximately 400 roles remain in Melksham to support the functions that continue there, including motorsports and motorcycle tire production, the materials business, Cooper Tire Europe headquarters, sales and marketing, and the Europe Technical Center.
As in the Americas Tire Operations segment, the International Tire Operations segment operates in a highly competitive industry, which includes Bridgestone Corporation, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Groupe Michelin and other domestic and international companies. These competitors are substantially larger than the Company and serve OEMs as well as the replacement tire market. The segment also faces competition from low-cost producers.
Strategy
The Company continues to execute towards strategic imperatives, namely building a sustainable cost competitive position, driving top-line profitable growth and building organizational capabilities and enablers to support strategic goals. The Company’s current strategic initiatives include increasing the Company’s retail presence by making Cooper products available at a greater number of retail points, in order to better align the availability of the Company's products with where consumers shop for tires. This effort includes not only entering into relationships with new retailers, but expanding and continuing to grow with existing customers. The Company is continuously finding ways to provide consumers with improved access to the Company’s brands and products, and cultivating increased demand for the Company's products. 
The Company is also evaluating and upgrading its global manufacturing footprint to align its technology, capabilities and production capacity in the right locations, to ensure a competitive cost structure and to best meet customer needs. On January 24,

2020, the Company acquired the remaining noncontrolling ownership interest in COOCSA, making COOCSA a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Americas Segment and allowing the Company to better leverage the low-cost facility. In addition, on April 5, 2019, Cooper Vietnam and Sailun Vietnam established a joint venture in Vietnam, ACTR, which began commercially producing TBR tires in 2020.
Improvement of the Company's product mix also continues to be a strategic imperative. 2020 reflected improved mix as a result of the continued transition to larger rim diameter tires. Additionally, the Company has expanded its TBR tire lineup with six new products in 2020.
Raw Materials
The Company’s principal raw materials include natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, chemicals and steel reinforcement components. The Company acquires its raw materials from various sources around the world to assure continuing supplies for its manufacturing operations and to mitigate the risk of potential supply disruptions.
During 2020, the Company experienced decreases in the costs of certain of its principal raw materials in comparison to 2019. The pricing volatility of natural rubber and certain other raw materials contributes to the difficulty in accurately predicting and managing these costs.
The Company has a purchasing office in Singapore to acquire natural rubber directly from producers in Southeast Asia. This purchasing operation enables the Company to work directly with producers to continually improve consistency and quality, while reducing the costs of materials, transportation and transactions.
The Company’s contractual relationships with its raw material suppliers are generally based on long-term agreements or purchase order arrangements. For natural rubber, natural gas and certain principal materials, procurement is managed through a combination of buying forward production requirements and utilizing the spot market. For other principal materials, procurement arrangements include supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing based on commodity indices, multi-year agreements or spot purchases. These arrangements only cover quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands.
Research, Development and Product Improvement
The Company directs its research activities toward product development, performance and operating efficiency. The Company conducts extensive testing of current tire lines, as well as new concepts in tire design, construction and materials. During 2020, almost 86 million miles of tests were performed on indoor test wheels and in monitored road tests. The Company has a tire and vehicle test track in Texas that assists with the Company’s testing activities. Uniformity equipment is used to physically monitor manufactured tires for high standards of ride quality. The Company continues to design and develop specialized equipment to fit the precise needs of its manufacturing and quality control requirements. 
Patents, Intellectual Property and Trademarks
The Company owns or has licenses to use patents and intellectual property covering various aspects in the design and manufacture of its products and processes and equipment for the manufacture of its products. While the Company believes these assets as a group are of material importance, it does not consider any one asset or group of these assets to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect its business.
The Company owns and uses tradenames and trademarks worldwide. While the Company believes such tradenames and trademarks as a group are of material importance, the trademarks the Company considers most significant to its business are those using the words "Cooper," "Mastercraft," "Roadmaster," "Starfire," “Avon" and "Mickey Thompson.” The Company believes all of these significant trademarks are valid and will have unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used. 
Seasonal Trends
Customers generally place orders on a month-to-month basis and the company adjusts production and inventory to meet those orders, which results in varying backlogs of orders at different times of the year. Tire sales are subject to a seasonal demand pattern. This usually results in the sales volumes being strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weaker in the first and second quarters. There is year-round demand for the Company's products, however, light vehicle replacement tire sales are generally strongest during the third and fourth quarters of the year. Winter tires are sold principally during the months of May through November.

Environmental Matters
The Company recognizes the importance of compliance in environmental matters and has programs in place to comply with local, state, federal and foreign requirements and regulations. The Company has an organizational structure which allows it to supervise environmental activities, planning and programs to ensure compliance and improve environmental performance. The Company also participates in activities concerning general industry environmental matters, and the Company is committed to achieving a baseline of key environmental sustainability metrics and targets. A number of the Company’s operations are certified to the ISO 14001 standard and the Company has been recognized with several awards for efforts to improve energy efficiency. 
The Company’s manufacturing facilities, like those of the industry generally, are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. In general, the Company has not experienced difficulty in complying with these requirements and believes they have not had a material adverse effect on its financial condition or the results of its operations. The Company expects additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed in the future. The Company’s 2020 expense and capital expenditures for environmental matters at its facilities were not material, nor is it expected that expenditures in 2021 for such matters will be material.
Governmental Regulations
The Company is subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where it conducts business. Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of employees, as well as financial resources. During 2020, aside from the Company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, compliance with the regulations applicable to the Company did not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Additional information about the impact of government regulations on the Company’s business is included in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” 
Global Social Impact
The Company is committed to environmental responsibility and the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community, as well as the long-term, sustainable health and growth of the Company. The Company believes that work-related illnesses, injuries, security and environmental incidents are preventable. It is the Company’s vision to have all employees and contractors working safely and in an environmentally responsible manner at all times. The Company's organizational structure allows it to supervise and audit, using a combination of internal and external resources, environmental activities, planning and programs to ensure compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety ("EHS") requirements and Company standards. Additionally, the Company has implemented a global EHS management system to predictably and sustainably manage EHS and to hold management accountable for non-compliance. The Company also participates in activities concerning general industry environmental matters, including being a founding member of the Tire Industry Project and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber.
