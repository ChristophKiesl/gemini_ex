Item 1. Business
General
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 2, 2016 under the name “Glolex Inc.” Our business was originally to provide a web based, round-the-clock, online legal consulting advice service.
 
As of June 25, 2019, Maksim Charniak, our sole executive officer and director, sold all of his shares of common stock of the Company to Amer Samad, resulting in a change of control of the Company. As part of that transaction, Mr. Charniak resigned from all of his officer and director positions, and Mr. Samad was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company, and was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company. Mr. Samad also purchased 14,744,687 shares (as adjusted to reflect the Company’s March 5, 2020 1:12.6374 forward stock split) of the Company’s common stock in a series of private transactions, resulting in Mr. Samad owning 52,671,888 shares (as adjusted to reflect the Company’s March 5, 2020 1:12.6374 forward stock split), or approximately 95.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.
 
We have not commenced material operations to date. As a result of the change of control transaction referred to above, we have suspended operations and are not currently commercializing our business plan, although we may recommence such operations in the future. At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees. As a result, we can be considered a shell company.
 
In addition, the Company has generated no revenue for the year ended March 31, 2020.
 
Our principal office is located at 1306 Hertel Avenue, Suite 3, Buffalo, NY 14216, and our telephone number is 718-902-7450.

On April 20, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), dated as of April 17, 2020, with Bed Therapies Inc., a Texas corporation (“BTI”), and the beneficial stockholders of BTI, to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of BTI. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, among other things, all outstanding shares of common stock of BTI, no par value, will be exchanged for shares of the Company’s common stock, based on an exchange ratio of one share of the Company’s common stock for every one share of BTI common stock (the “Acquisition”). Upon the closing of the Acquisition, BTI will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The completion of the Acquisition is subject to various customary conditions, including, among other things, the preparation of audited financial statements of the Company and BTI under applicable law. However, we can give no assurance that the Acquisition will be consummated at all.
