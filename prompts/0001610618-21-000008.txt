Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of long-acting therapeutics designed to transform the standard of care for patients facing serious fungal or viral infections. Our lead product candidate is rezafungin acetate, an intravenous formulation of a novel echinocandin. Rezafungin is being developed as a once-weekly, high-exposure therapy for the first-line treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. In addition, we are using our Cloudbreak® antiviral platform to develop Antiviral Conjugates, or AVCs, for the prevention and treatment of influenza and other viral infections, including RSV, HIV and the SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19.
We are focused on the anti-infectives market, which we believe has the following advantages for the development of innovative products:
•a high correlation between efficacy in preclinical animal models and outcomes of clinical trials for systemic disease,
•a regulatory environment that provides developers of anti-infectives opportunities to reduce development costs and time to market,
•an ability to commercialize anti-infective products with a focused sales and marketing organization for inpatient and outpatient settings, and
•an opportunity to commercialize products for indications in both treatment and prevention of infectious disease.
While the advantages above apply to many product candidates in the anti-infectives market, we are focused on the antifungal and antiviral segments. We believe these are commercially more attractive segments of the market, particularly when compared to the antibacterial segment. For example, rezafungin will be positioned in the estimated $4.2 billion global systemic antifungal market in which there is high unmet need, high mortality rate and few new agents in development.
Rezafungin
Rezafungin is a novel molecule in the echinocandin class of antifungals. We are developing rezafungin for the first-line treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections which are associated with high mortality rates.
STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial
In March 2018 and July 2019, we reported positive topline results from Parts A and B, respectively, of our global, randomized Phase 2 STRIVE clinical trial of rezafungin. STRIVE was an international, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of once-weekly dosing of rezafungin compared to once-daily dosing of caspofungin in patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. In the STRIVE clinical trial, rezafungin met all of its objectives for efficacy, safety and tolerability in the treatment of patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis.
Phase 3 clinical trials
Our Phase 3 clinical development plans for rezafungin are as follows:
•Phase 3 ReSTORE Treatment Trial: A single, global, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. The ReSTORE clinical trial protocol is modeled after our Phase 2 STRIVE clinical trial. Rezafungin, dosed at 400 mg for the first week followed by 200 mg once weekly for up to four weeks in total, is being compared to caspofungin, dosed daily, with an optional step down to oral fluconazole, in a 1:1 randomization regime. The primary efficacy outcome for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is all-cause mortality at day 30, and the primary efficacy outcome for the European Medical Agency, or EMA, is global response (clinical, radiological, and mycological response) at day 14. We expect this trial to enroll approximately 184 evaluable patients. Enrollment in the ReSTORE clinical trial remains impacted by the global pandemic to varying degrees by region. Based on recent enrollment trends, we expect the availability of top-line data by the end of 2021; however, the global effect of COVID-19 on enrollment is unpredictable and may change this timing. We expect that the results of the ReSTORE clinical trial, along with the results from the STRIVE clinical trial, will be sufficient to support the submission of marketing approval applications for rezafungin in this indication.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•Phase 3 ReSPECT Prophylaxis (Prevention) Trial: A single, global, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant to assess rezafungin in a 90-day prophylaxis regimen to prevent infections due to Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis. Rezafungin, dosed at 400 mg for the first week followed by 200 mg once weekly doses out to 90 days, is being compared to a regimen containing two drugs (an azole and Bactrim) dosed once daily for 90 days. The primary efficacy outcome for the FDA and EMA is fungal-free survival at day 90. We expect this trial to enroll approximately 462 patients. While the ReSPECT trial has been impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, enrollment continues and we are progressing with regulatory and clinical activities so that we may continue activating trial sites. Additionally, commencement of the ReSPECT clinical trial in the United States also remains contingent upon obtaining agreement with the FDA.
Mundipharma Collaboration
On September 3, 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Mundipharma Medical Company, or Mundipharma, to develop and commercialize rezafungin in an intravenous formulation for the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we granted Mundipharma an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, register and commercialize rezafungin outside the United States and Japan. The total potential transaction value is $568 million, including an equity investment, an up-front payment, global development funding, and certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. To date, we have received $9.0 million from the sale of our equity to Mundipharma, $30.0 million in up-front payments and $27.9 million in global development funding, which includes an $11.1 million milestone payment we received in January 2021. We expect to receive an additional $14.4 million in global development funding as we continue to conduct our rezafungin Phase 3 clinical development program.
Cloudbreak® Antiviral Platform
We believe our Cloudbreak antiviral platform is a fundamentally new approach to prevent and treat life-threatening infectious disease that provides potent antimicrobial activity and immune system engagement in a single long-acting molecule. The Cloudbreak antiviral platform recognizes that infectious disease often results when a microbial pathogen is able to evade or overcome the host immune system. Our Cloudbreak candidates are designed to counter infection in two ways, by inhibiting pathogen proliferation through direct targeting and by focusing the immune system at the site of infection. We believe this is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current therapies, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Our lead Cloudbreak candidates are AVCs for the prevention and treatment of influenza. 
In July 2019, we nominated our initial development candidate, CD377 for influenza prevention and pandemic preparedness. In September 2020, we nominated a second development candidate, CD388, which is similar to CD377 but provides the potential for longer-lasting protection from influenza. We expect to file an investigational new drug application for CD388 by the end of 2021. The Cloudbreak antiviral platform has also enabled us to expand the development of AVCs to target other life-threatening viruses, including the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and the SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to become the leading biotechnology company in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel, best-in-class long-acting anti-infectives for treatment and prevention, targeting the antifungal and antiviral segments. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advance rezafungin to commercialization. We are developing rezafungin, a once-weekly echinocandin antifungal, to address serious fungal infections, including, but not limited to those considered urgent and serious threats by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. We are conducting two clinical trials that, if successful, would allow us to target two distinct and commercially-attractive market segments with significant unmet needs from the current standard of care: the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, and the prevention of invasive fungal infections in a highly vulnerable population, adults undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation. 
•Develop product candidates from our Cloudbreak antiviral platform. We are progressing towards an investigational new drug application for CD388 for seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention and treatment, and are developing new antiviral conjugates targeting the prevention and treatment of other viral pathogens such as RSV, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2. We may fund these programs alone, with grant or government contract funding or through new partnerships we may consider. We will also continue to establish intellectual property related to the Cloudbreak antiviral platform, its applications and development candidates.
•Commercialize products in the United States with a targeted sales force. The anti-infectives market benefits from an ability to address large sales opportunities with a relatively small, specialized commercial organization. We currently intend to build and manage a targeted sales and marketing organization to commercialize 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

rezafungin in the United States, addressing the relatively small base of well-defined infectious disease and hematology customers who manage invasive fungal infections in both the hospital and outpatient settings. In geographies outside the United States and Japan, our strategic partner Mundipharma has the right to commercialize rezafungin.
Rezafungin
We acquired rezafungin, a novel echinocandin antifungal agent, in 2014. We believe rezafungin has the potential to be differentiated from other echinocandins and other classes of antifungal agents based on its once-weekly dosing, high front -loaded exposure, high tissue penetration, safety and tolerability profile, lack of drug-drug interactions and broad spectrum.
Rezafungin is being developed for both the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. 
Overview of Systemic Fungal Infections and the Antifungal Market
Fungal infections pose significant medical challenges in both the hospital and outpatient settings. While fungi are ubiquitous in our environment, they are usually harmless for people with a normal immune system. If fungi access and proliferate in the bloodstream, these infections become systemic and potentially life-threatening. Risk factors for systemic fungal infections include recent gastrointestinal surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, central vascular catheter placement, use of total parenteral nutrition, renal failure, solid organ transplantation, blood and marrow transplantation or BMT, chemotherapy and other forms of immune suppression.
We estimate that the annual worldwide sales of prescription systemic antifungals in 2017 were approximately $4.2 billion. This includes therapies used as prophylaxis (preventive) in the inpatient and outpatient setting, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, or those undergoing BMT, therapies used for the treatment of hospitalized patients, and therapies used for the treatment of patients who are being discharged from the hospital. 
The majority of invasive fungal infections are caused by two fungi, Candida and Aspergillus. We estimate that approximately 97,000 Americans may die from invasive fungal infections each year. Approximately 90 percent of all reported fungal related deaths result from a few common fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis. Systemic Candida infections include candidemia and invasive candidiasis. In a 2014 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, candidemia was shown to be the most common cause of healthcare-acquired bloodstream infections in the United States.
Despite advances achieved in the diagnosis and treatment of candidemia, these infections continue to cause high mortality rates. According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Disease (2009), candidemia has a crude mortality rate of 35% within 12 weeks of diagnosis. By contrast, the CDC reports that the mortality rate due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections is 13%. Further, it is estimated that each case of candidemia results in an additional 23 days of hospitalization and over $68,000 in additional treatment costs.
Physicians’ options for the treatment of systemic fungal infections are limited by a lack of innovative therapies. Several factors have contributed to the low rate of antifungal drug development, including a limited number of fungal-specific drug targets for research and a previously challenging regulatory environment that necessitated large and costly clinical trials. As a result, the number of antifungals has decreased to only one new approval since 2006, while anti-microbial resistance has increased.
The current treatment alternatives for systemic fungal infections, including polyenes, azoles and currently-approved echinocandins, have limitations that we believe may be addressed by novel antifungals. While these drugs have proven to be efficacious in many patients, mortality rates remain high, and the polyenes and azoles may cause severe side effects warranting discontinuation and are known to cause significant changes in a drug's effect on the body when taken together with a second drug, or drug-drug interactions, or DDIs. Patients who have received a BMT, cancer chemotherapy or solid organ transplant may receive antifungal prophylaxis to prevent deadly Candida, Aspergillus and/or Pneumocystis infections for several weeks to over a year, depending on the period of immunosuppression or development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Current paradigms for the prevention of invasive fungal disease are complex because they require patient-specific plans and drug cocktails, dictated by the underlying disease and the local epidemiology of fungal infections which may be subject to change even when customized.
In the hematology setting, patients are at increased risk for serious DDIs given many newly approved therapies used to treat blood cancers have contraindications or precautions when taken with azole antifungals, the current standard of care for antifungal prophylaxis. For prevention of PCP, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or TMP/SMX, known as Bactrim, is the agent of choice for first-line prophylaxis. Challenges with TMP/SMX include bone marrow suppression, allergies, and nephrotoxicity.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Current prophylaxis requires multiple drugs for coverage of common pathogens. The complex nature of the immunocompromised patient and the complexity of the current antifungal drugs used today for prophylaxis (azoles and TMP/SMX), create significant opportunity for improvement.
Echinocandins, introduced in 2001, are increasingly recommended for the treatment of fungal infections in the United States. In December 2015, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or the IDSA, released new clinical guidelines that recognize that echinocandins have demonstrated statistical superiority to azoles for the initial treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, and now recommend echinocandins as first-line treatment for this indication.
The currently approved echinocandins include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, and are considered both well tolerated and safe relative to other antifungal drug classes. However, they must be administered daily by intravenous infusion, potentially extending the hospitalization of patients for the duration of therapy and limiting their use mainly to the hospital setting. Despite this limitation, the use of echinocandins in the outpatient setting is growing at approximately ten percent per year, and the total days of therapy for this class are shifting from inpatient to outpatient therapy. This trend is reflective of an increased need for broad spectrum Candida coverage, increasing azole resistance and complications due to the complexity of patients, and a financial incentive to discharge patients earlier to reduce hospital costs.
The CDC reports that certain species of Candida are becoming increasingly resistant to available antifungals, such as azoles and approved echinocandins. Widespread usage of antifungals in the azole class, in particular, has stimulated an increase in resistance. Non-albicans Candida, which have a higher rate of azole resistance, now cause approximately two-thirds of candidemia cases in the United States. In 2019, the CDC issued its Report on Antibiotic Resistant Threats. The list included several fungal pathogens: Candida auris is listed as an ‘Urgent Threat’, Drug-resistant Candida is listed as a “Serious Threat’ and Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus as a ‘Watch List Threat’.
In order to be effective, an echinocandin drug should be present early in therapy at an exposure that is as high as is safely possible. The key pharmacokinetic parameters affecting exposure include the drug’s half-life, Cmax and AUC. The maximum dose that can be used is based on the drug’s overall safety profile. With echinocandin drugs, high drug exposures early in therapy, as measured by Cmax or AUC, maximize the antifungal therapeutic benefit of these drugs. 
When a fungus starts to develop resistance to a drug, the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, rises, which means that a higher drug exposure will be required in order for the drug to have the same efficacy as it has against sensitive strains. Having a C max and an AUC that are far greater than the starting MIC provides the best chance of treating infections caused by strains resistant to other antifungals, including other echinocandins. Additionally, the EU label for caspofungin requires higher doses in obese patients. A recent analysis found that micafungin, the market leader in the United States, achieves 85% - 88% target attainment (against C. glabrata MIC97 of 0.06 mg/L) when given at the higher dosing regimen of 200 mg followed by 150 mg, daily but achieves only 10% - 50% with its approved dose of 100 mg once daily. These factors suggest the pharmacokinetics of the currently approved echinocandins are not optimal.
Despite the widespread continued use of each class of antifungals, we believe that market opportunities exist for novel therapeutics which combine the spectrum and safety of the echinocandins, while improving pharmacokinetic characteristics to enable enhanced efficacy and convenience.
Our Solution—Rezafungin for the Treatment and Prevention of Serious Fungal Infections
Due to its novel chemical structure, rezafungin has a prolonged half-life, a high Cmax and a high AUC. In addition, rezafungin was tested in vitro against 27 echinocandin-non-susceptible Candida isolates and demonstrated equivalent or greater potency against these strains compared to caspofungin, with up to eight-fold greater potency for several isolates. Rezafungin was also tested in vitro against 100 isolates of Candida auris, a highly resistant emerging strain, including eight isolates that were resistant to other echinocandins, and showed equivalent or better potency (up to 64-fold) than the currently available echinocandins against the echinocandin-resistant strains. 
These factors are in contrast to all other echinocandins, and we believe they can allow rezafungin to be developed as a once-weekly intravenous therapy for the treatment and prevention of systemic fungal infections. We are developing rezafungin to overcome the limitations of the echinocandin class and other antifungals by offering the following key benefits.
•Potential to treat resistant pathogens. We believe that rezafungin can be used to treat fungal infections caused by drug-resistant fungi, including those currently resistant to echinocandins, due to its potency against resistant strains and its higher drug exposure early in the course of therapy. We expect that this higher exposure early in the course of disease will improve outcomes in infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens.
•Single-agent treatment. Rather than treating patients with an echinocandin followed by an oral azole solely to enable earlier hospital discharge, rezafungin would enable extended single-agent intravenous echinocandin treatment for the full course of therapy, thereby enabling treatment that is consistent with current guidance in the United States and European Union.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•Shorter and less costly hospital stays, and lower outpatient costs. Physicians with access to a once-weekly intravenous echinocandin can potentially discharge appropriate patients earlier and thereby reduce hospital costs, which we believe may account for over 80% of the overall treatment cost of candidemia. Furthermore, early discharge from the hospital setting may reduce the risk for contracting nosocomial infections. For patients discharged on an intravenous echinocandin, once-weekly rezafungin could eliminate significant outpatient infusion costs for once-daily intravenous echinocandin therapy.
•Improved compliance. A once-weekly treatment of rezafungin could facilitate compliance by eliminating the need for patients to return to a hospital or outpatient center for a daily dose of an intravenous echinocandin, and could eliminate the likelihood of patient non-compliance for those receiving oral step-down therapy with a daily azole.
•Enabling or improving prophylaxis regimens. Some patients cannot receive azole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylactic therapy due to drug interactions or poor tolerability. We expect that once weekly rezafungin therapy could provide for better prophylactic therapy on an inpatient and outpatient basis, particularly for these patients.
We have sought multiple designations from regulators, including the FDA and the EMA, to support the rapid evaluation of rezafungin in the development phase and to enhance the commercial attributes of rezafungin in the commercial phase. 
In the United States, the FDA has granted rezafungin the following designations:
•For the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, rezafungin has designations for Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug. QIDP and Orphan Drug designations together provide a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity in the United States from the time of FDA approval.
•For the prophylactic use in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant, rezafungin has designations for QIDP and Fast Track. The QIDP designation provides a total of five years of marketing exclusivity in the United States from the time of FDA approval.
The FDA’s QIDP and Fast Track designations are designed to provide eligibility for (1) more frequent interactions with the FDA to expedite drug development and review, (2) priority review, which seeks to reduce the time for FDA to take action on a New Drug Application from 10 months to six months, and (3) a five-year extension to any marketing exclusivity period for which the drug qualifies on approval. The FDA’s Orphan Drug designation is designed to provide eligibility for (1) a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval, (2) financial benefits including a waiver from payment of user fees and tax credits for the cost of the clinical research, and (3) an exemption from performing clinical trials in pediatric patients. 
In the EU, the European Commission has granted rezafungin Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The Orphan Drug Designation provides (1) unlimited scientific advice on the trials needed to assess benefit risk, (2) reduced fees, (3) 10 years of market exclusivity protection from similar medicines with similar indications upon approval of the marketing authorization, and (4) two additional years of market exclusivity when the results from pediatric studies compliant with an approved Pediatric Investigational Plan, or PIP, are included in the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC. 
We, together with our partner Mundipharma, plan to seek orphan drug designation for rezafungin for prophylactic use in the United States and Europe. 
Rezafungin Clinical Results
Phase 2: The STRIVE Clinical Trial
In March 2018 and July 2019, we reported positive topline results from Parts A and B, respectively, of our global, randomized Phase 2 STRIVE clinical trial of rezafungin. STRIVE was an international, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of once-weekly dosing of rezafungin compared to once-daily dosing of caspofungin in patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. The STRIVE clinical trial enrolled 183 patients in the microbiological intent-to-treat, or mITT, population. Patients were randomized to receive either 400 mg of rezafungin administered intravenously once weekly for two to four weeks, 400 mg of rezafungin for the first week followed by 200mg of rezafungin once weekly for an additional one to three weeks, or daily caspofungin administered intravenously according to the approved prescribing information, with an optional step down to oral fluconazole. In the STRIVE clinical trial, rezafungin met all of its objectives for efficacy, safety and tolerability in the treatment of patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

The STRIVE Phase 2 results show that patients treated with rezafungin had numerically improved outcomes as compared to caspofungin across all efficacy measures at the 400 mg/200 mg dosing regimen selected for the ReSTORE Phase 3 trial. Data from the clinical trial indicated that a 400mg/200mg dosing regimen of rezafungin had lower All Cause Mortality at Day 30 (4.3%), higher Clinical Response at Day 14 (80.4%), and a higher Overall Success at Day 14 (76.1%) when compared with once daily caspofungin (13.1%, 70.5%, and 67.2%, respectively).
Rezafungin was generally well-tolerated at both dosing regimens. Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, or TEAEs, were observed in most patients, with an incidence of 87.7% in Group 1, 92.5% in Group 2, and 80.9% in Group 3. The rates of serious adverse events were 43.2%, 52.8%, and 42.6%, respectively. There were 11 adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation across all study groups: six in Group 1, one in Group 2 and four in Group 3.
There were four serious adverse events possibly related to study drug: one in Group 1, one in Group 2 and two in Group 3, and both rezafungin patients fully recovered. There were no deaths related to study drug, and there were no concerning trends in system organ class groups or specific adverse events.
In addition, a post-hoc analysis evaluated the STRIVE Phase 2 clinical trial endpoints of Day 30 All-Cause Mortality and Day 14 Clinical Response, which represent the FDA and EMA primary endpoints, respectively, for the ReSTORE Phase 3 clinical trial. For the two cohorts considered, the 400 mg/200 mg rezafungin dosing regimen (Phase 3 ReSTORE clinical trial regimen) and the combined 400 mg/200 mg and 400 mg/400 mg dosing regimens, the results from the post hoc analysis of STRIVE showed that, for both primary endpoints, the limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both cohorts were within the 20% noninferiority margins that will be applied to evaluate the data generated by the ReSTORE clinical trial.
Phase 1: Hepatic Impairment Study
In January 2020, the first subject was enrolled into our Phase 1 Hepatic Impairment study. The study is an open label, single dose study design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of rezafungin in adult subjects with hepatic impairment relative to matched controls.
Phase 1: Subcutaneous Formulation Trial
In December 2019, the National Institutes of Health initiated a Phase 1 trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics for a subcutaneous formulation of rezafungin. The study was paused due to injection site reactions at the site of the subcutaneous administration of rezafungin in a subset of study subjects. The injection site reactions were local and are not observed during IV administration of rezafungin. In April 2020, the decision was made to discontinue further dosing and wind down the study.
Phase 1: AME Study
In May 2019, we completed our Phase 1, single-center, open-label study to evaluate the excretion, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and mass balance following a single intravenous dose of radiolabeled rezafungin in healthy adult male subjects. The primary route of excretion was via the feces. Rezafungin concentrations and radiolabeled rezafungin equivalents were quantifiable at all scheduled postdose collections through Day 60. Rezafungin underwent minimal metabolism in human subjects. A single dose of radiolabeled rezafungin was well tolerated.
Phase 1: DDI Study
In May 2018, we obtained data from our Phase 1 Drug-Drug Interaction study, or DDI study, to evaluate the potential effects of rezafungin on other drugs representing the most common metabolic (CYP enzymes) and transporter pathways. We evaluated the pharmacokinetics, or PK, of several drug combinations with and without rezafungin. The results suggested no clinically significant drug-drug interactions with any of the drugs tested including: tacrolimus, repaglinide, metformin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, caffeine, efavirenz, midazolam and digoxin. Together with in vitro experiments, we do not expect drug-drug interactions for rezafungin via common drug metabolism or transport pathways.
Phase 1: Photosafety Study
In March 2018, we completed our phase 1, multiple-dose, assessor-blinded study to determine the photosensitivity of rezafungin when administered intravenously as multiple doses to healthy adult subjects. The pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of rezafungin was comparable to prior studies of rezafungin. Based on the results of this study, the increased risk for photosensitivity in subjects who are administered rezafungin is mild. Overall, rezafungin was well tolerated by healthy adult subjects.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Phase 1: QT Trial
In March 2018, we announced the results of our definitive Phase 1 QT clinical trial of rezafungin. The QT clinical trial was a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, comparative study of the effect of single-ascending doses of rezafungin, intravenous placebo, and a single oral dose of moxifloxacin (positive control) in healthy adult subjects. The primary objective was to assess the effects of rezafungin on QT interval. Secondary objectives included assessments of other cardiac conduction parameters, including PR intervals, QRS intervals and heart rate. The results of the trial indicated that rezafungin in single intravenous doses up to 1400 mg had no significant effect on QT prolongation or on any of the other cardiac conduction parameters tested.
Phase 1: SAD / MAD Trials
In November 2015, we obtained data from our single ascending dose, or SAD, study of rezafungin. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous doses of rezafungin in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that rezafungin was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after single doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. Rezafungin exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing.
In January 2016, we obtained data from our multiple ascending dose, or MAD, Phase 1 study. This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple intravenous doses of rezafungin in healthy subjects. Results demonstrated that rezafungin was well tolerated in all dose cohorts after multiple doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. Rezafungin exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with preclinical data and supportive of once-weekly dosing.
For both Phase 1 SAD and MAD trials, there were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, severe TEAEs, or relationships for overall TEAEs. The majority of TEAEs were mild, and all TEAEs completely resolved by the end of the study. There were no drug-related TEAEs resulting from clinically significant hematology or clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities at any dose. In addition, there were no safety issues related to electrocardiograms, vital signs, or physical exam findings.
The clinical results of these Phase 1 trials demonstrated that a single dose of rezafungin is sufficient drug exposure for a period of seven days. In contrast, a single dose of anidulafungin provides sufficient drug exposure for only one day. Rezafungin has the potential to be safely developed as a once-weekly intravenous drug for the effective and convenient treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections in the inpatient or outpatient settings.
In addition, rezafungin demonstrated a Cmax and an AUC significantly higher than other approved echinocandins. Based on the higher drug exposure demonstrated by rezafungin early in the course of therapy and high, sustained tissue concentration at the site of infection, we believe that rezafungin can be used to treat some fungal infections caused by less susceptible fungi, including some of those currently resistant to echinocandins. We expect that this higher exposure and enhanced tissue penetration early in the course of disease will improve outcomes in infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens.
Clinical Development Plan
Our Phase 3 clinical development plans for rezafungin are as follows:
•Phase 3 ReSTORE Treatment Trial: A single, global, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis. The ReSTORE clinical trial protocol is modeled after our Phase 2 STRIVE clinical trial. Rezafungin, dosed at 400 mg for the first week followed by 200 mg once weekly for up to four weeks in total, is being compared to caspofungin, dosed daily, with an optional step down to oral fluconazole, in a 1:1 randomization regime. The primary efficacy outcome for the FDA is all-cause mortality at day 30, and the primary efficacy outcome for the EMA is global response (clinical, radiological, and mycological response) at day 14. We expect this trial to enroll approximately 184 evaluable patients. Enrollment in the ReSTORE clinical trial remains impacted by the global pandemic to varying degrees by region. Based on recent enrollment trends, we expect the availability of top-line data by the end of 2021; however, the global effect of COVID-19 on enrollment is unpredictable and may change this timing. We expect that the results of the ReSTORE clinical trial, along with the results from the STRIVE clinical trial, will be sufficient to support the submission of marketing approval applications for rezafungin in this indication.
•Phase 3 ReSPECT Prophylaxis (Prevention) Trial: A single, global, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant to assess rezafungin in a 90-day prophylaxis regimen to prevent infections due to Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis. Rezafungin, dosed at 400 mg for the first week followed by 200 mg once weekly doses out to 90 days, is being compared to a regimen containing two drugs (an azole and Bactrim) dosed once daily for 90 days. The primary efficacy outcome for the FDA and EMA is fungal-free survival at day 90. We expect this trial to enroll approximately 462 patients. While the ReSPECT trial has been impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, enrollment continues and we are progressing with regulatory and clinical activities so that we may continue activating trial

sites. Additionally, commencement of the ReSPECT clinical trial in the United States also remains contingent upon obtaining agreement with the FDA.
Cloudbreak Antiviral Platform
The Cloudbreak antiviral platform is a fundamentally new approach to the fight against life-threatening infectious disease that provides potent antimicrobial activity and immune system engagement in a single molecule. Our lead Cloudbreak candidates are AVCs for the prevention and treatment of influenza. The Cloudbreak antiviral platform has enabled us to expand the development of AVCs to target RSV, HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and other life-threatening viruses.
The Cloudbreak antiviral platform recognizes that most infectious disease results when a microbial pathogen is able to evade or overcome the host immune system. Our Cloudbreak candidates are designed to counter infection in two ways, by inhibiting pathogen proliferation through direct targeting and by focusing the immune system at the site of infection. In this way, Cloudbreak AVC candidates are similar to certain cancer immunotherapies that unlock the potential of the immune system to destroy cancer cells.
Cloudbreak candidates targeting viral infections are called AVCs, single molecules consisting of two distinct moieties with discrete, yet complementary mechanisms of action:
•Targeting Moiety (TM): A highly potent small molecule and/or peptide that binds surface targets on the pathogen or host cell to directly inhibit viral proliferation.
•Effector Moiety (EM): A proprietary composition that contains the fragment crystallizable, or Fc, region of human IgG1 antibodies, which was selected to maximize engagement of the human immune system via Fc-gamma receptors and extend half-life.
AVCs not only mediate pathogen clearance through a multimodal mechanism of action but also have potential for months of activity with a single dose.
Cloudbreak AVC (Antiviral Conjugate) Program Overview
Cidara is leveraging the Cloudbreak antiviral platform to develop multiple AVCs. Each AVC targets a life-threatening virus. Our AVC research and development programs include:
•Influenza;
•RSV;
•HIV; 
•SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19; and
•Other viruses.
AVCs provide direct, sustained antiviral activity as well as immune system engagement, for effective prevention and treatment of disease. This is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current approaches. AVCs are not vaccines, small-molecule drugs, or monoclonal antibodies. AVCs are novel, Fc-conjugates designed for the following features:
•Multimodal mechanism of action: Potent, direct antiviral activity and immune system engagement
•Strong target binding: High affinity to essential, conserved targets on the virus surface and/or surface of infected cells
•Long duration of action: Months of protection from disease with a single dose
•Rapid onset: Rapid distribution to site of infection for treatment of disease

Cloudbreak Influenza Program and Our AVC Development Candidates CD377 and CD388
Influenza, or flu, is a respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. The influenza virus can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Young children, adults older than 65 years, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients are more prone to infection, but even healthy people are at risk of infection with seasonal flu. The primary preventive measure to protect against influenza is the seasonal vaccine, which remains the best mode to prevent influenza related illness, despite its limitations. However, the efficacy of the vaccine varies, with recent studies estimating that the influenza vaccine reduces the risk of influenza illness by between 38% and 62%, depending on the virus strain and age and health of the recipient, among other factors. While today’s flu vaccines are credited with significant public health benefits and offer our current best defense, only 52% of Americans get an annual flu vaccine. As a result, a large proportion of Americans are still at risk of getting the flu yearly. For example, during the 2018-19 flu season, 71% did not respond to vaccination and 34,200 people died of flu-related illness in the US. The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the United States healthcare system and society is more than $11.2 billion. In years when the seasonal vaccine results in sub-optimal protection such as the 2018-2019 influenza season when the CDC estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 29% in the United States, more patients are at higher risk for serious complications resulting from the flu. Vulnerable patient populations must then rely upon therapeutic options.
Older antiviral medications, such as amantadine and rimantadine, are no longer recommended for use because of high levels of resistance. Currently, four antiviral drugs are recommended by the CDC for treating the flu:
•oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®);
•zanamivir (Relenza®);
•peramivir (Rapivab®); and
•baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza™).
The above list includes neuraminidase inhibitors and the recently approved cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir. These molecules have one or more of the following limitations: short half-life; high susceptibility to resistance; multi-dose regimens; and dosing route limitations. The current therapies should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective.
Potential Advantages of Cloudbreak AVCs for Influenza
•Broad-Spectrum, Universal Coverage: Cloudbreak AVCs have demonstrated activity against pandemic and seasonal influenza A and B viruses, including resistant strains (e.g. oseltamivir-resistant H1N1) and strains with high pandemic potential (e.g. H5N1, H7N9)
•Superior Resistance Profile: AVCs may be less prone to viral resistance, by virtue of the AVC multimodal mechanism of action
•Protection for High-Risk Populations: Unlike vaccines, the potent intrinsic activity of the AVCs should provide antiviral protection independent of immune system status. Even in immune-compromised patients, AVCs can focus the existing immune system at the site of infection
•Seasonal and Pandemic Readiness: AVCs are well-suited for immediate and robust response to influenza challenges by providing rapid onset of protection and coverage of strains that may have been missed by the seasonal vaccine. Moreover, AVCs are not subject to the lengthy and unpredictable process of vaccine manufacturing
•Long Duration of Action: A single AVC dose may protect from influenza for an entire flu season
AVC Development Candidates for Influenza: CD377 and CD388
Pre-Clinical Studies of CD377 for Influenza
We plan to develop novel AVCs that provide a direct and sustained antiviral effect and engage the immune system for additional potency. The results of multiple preclinical studies with CD377 and CD388 indicate that they are effective in both the treatment and prevention of influenza infections. CD388 has been engineered to extend half-life and has the potential to extend the duration of protection versus CD377 in prophylactic applications with similar doses.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

In Vitro Studies Measuring CD377 Potency Against Multiple Influenza Strains
We evaluated CD377 in vitro for its ability to inhibit viral replication in a human epithelial cell line versus a range of seasonal and pandemic Influenza A strains, including 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain, H3N2 and H5N1, H1N1 oseltamivir (Tamiflu)-resistant strain, as well as Influenza B. CD377 showed potent activity against all of the strains tested, including influenza B, which is less sensitive to oseltamivir phosphate.
In Vivo Studies Measuring CD377 Potency Against Multiple Influenza Strains in Lethal Infection Models
We evaluated CD377 in vivo in lethal mouse models of H1N1 and H3N2 compared to oseltamivir phosphate. CD377 provided 100% protection against both H1N1 and H3N2 using single, low doses, while oseltamivir phosphate required twice daily dosing for 5 days to protect 100% and 80% of mice from death in the H1N1 and H3N2 models, respectively. CD377 was able to provide the same protection as oseltamivir phosphate in these models at approximately 1/500th to 1/1000th the cumulative dose.
In both studies, we also measured the average body weights of the mice over time to support the survival data with CD377. The CD377 dosed mice maintained stable body weights over the 14-day course of the experiment demonstrating the potency of CD377 at low doses and the potency and tolerability of CD377 at high doses. The mice dosed with oseltamivir phosphate showed approximately 10% loss of body weight upon discontinuation of treatment after the five-day treatment cycle, suggesting that the influenza virus was not eradicated upon cessation of treatment. Body weights for the mice dosed with oseltamivir phosphate recovered as their immune system overcame the disease.
Additional pre-clinical toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys indicate the potential for a broad safety margin for CD377. No signs of acute or chronic toxicity were observed at the top doses tested in rat and monkey. Based on prophylactic efficacy models in mouse and multi-species pharmacokinetics, the therapeutic margins at the top doses tested in rat and monkey were greater than 35-fold and 95-fold, respectively.
In Vivo Study Evaluating CD377 as a Long-Acting Prophylactic Agent Against Influenza
We tested mean plasma concentrations of CD377 in mice and based on the long half-life we observed, we evaluated CD377 in vivo in a lethal mouse model of H1N1 by administering CD377 to the mice 28 days before we administered the lethal influenza challenge. CD377 provided 100% protection from mortality across a broad range of dose levels, demonstrating its potential suitability as a long-acting prophylactic agent for seasonal prevention.
In Vivo Study Measuring CD377 Treatment Window Against Influenza
We evaluated CD377 and oseltamivir phosphate in vivo in a lethal mouse model of H1N1 by challenging the mice with the influenza virus and then administering antiviral treatment at different time periods after challenge. CD377 and oseltamivir phosphate both provided 100% protection against influenza when dosed up to 24 hours post-infection. However, when anti-viral treatment was administered at 48- and 72-hours post-infection, a single dose of CD377 was more effective at reducing mortality than multiple doses of oseltamivir phosphate.
In Vivo Studies Evaluating CD377 and CD388 PK and Potency in Lethal Influenza Infection Models 
We evaluated CD377 and CD388 PK and efficacy in lethal humanized mouse models of H1N1 where both molecules were administered 7 days prior to infection. CD388 demonstrated higher plasma levels and protected mice from mortality at lower doses than CD377. Additionally, the PK profiles of CD377 and CD388 were compared in primates, where CD388 demonstrated higher plasma levels and a longer half-life. These results collectively demonstrate that CD388 could significantly extend the duration of protection versus CD377 at similar doses.
License and Collaboration Agreements
Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement
In September 2019, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement with Mundipharma for a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize rezafungin in an intravenous formulation, or the Licensed Product, for the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections.
Collaboration. Under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, we will be responsible for leading the conduct of an agreed global development plan, or the Global Development Plan, that includes our ongoing Phase 3 ReSTORE Treatment Trial of the Licensed Product for the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis our planned Phase 3 ReSPECT Prophylaxis (Prevention) Trial of the Licensed Product, as well as specified GLP-compliant non‑clinical studies and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, development activities for the Licensed Product. Mundipharma will be 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

responsible for performing all development activities, other than Global Development Plan activities, that may be necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the Licensed Product outside of the United States and Japan, or the Munipharma Territory, at Mundipharma’s sole cost.
Licenses. Pursuant to the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, we granted Mundipharma an exclusive, royalty‑bearing license to develop, register and commercialize the Licensed Product in the Munipharma Territory, subject to our retained right to lead a global development program for the Licensed Product in both the Mundipharma Territory and in the United States and Japan, or the Company Territory, as described below.
The Company also granted Mundipharma an option to obtain exclusive licenses to develop, register and commercialize rezafungin in a formulation for subcutaneous administration, or Subcutaneous Product, and in formulations for other modes of administration, or Other Products, in the Mundipharma Territory, subject to similar rights retained by us to conduct mutually agreed global development activities for such products. In addition, we granted Mundipharma a co‑exclusive, worldwide license to manufacture the Licensed Product and rezafungin.
Until the seventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of the Licensed Product in the Mundipharma Territory, each party has granted the other party an exclusive, time-limited right of first negotiation to obtain a license to any anti-fungal product (other than Licensed Product, Subcutaneous Product and Other Products) that such party proposes to out-license in the other party’s territory. However, in the event of the acquisition of a party by a third party, this right of first negotiation will not apply to any such anti‑fungal product of the acquiring third party prior to consummation of the acquisition of such party, acquired by such acquiring third party from another third party after consummation of the acquisition of such party, or developed internally by the acquiring third party, either before or after consummation of the acquisition of such party, without the use of, reliance upon or reference to any technology of the acquired party that is licensed to the other party under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, any technology of the other party that is licensed to the acquired party under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, or any technology jointly developed by the parties pursuant to the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement.
Our Retained Rights. We retain the exclusive right to develop, register and commercialize the Licensed Product, Subcutaneous Product and Other Products in the Company Territory, and Mundipharma has granted us certain licenses under Mundipharma-controlled technology and jointly-developed technology to develop, register and commercialize Licensed Product, Subcutaneous Product and Other Products in the Company Territory and to manufacture such products and rezafungin worldwide.
Financial Terms. We and Mundipharma agreed to share equally (50/50) the costs of Global Development Plan activities, or Global Development Costs, subject to a cap on Mundipharma’s Global Development Cost share of $31.207 million. In January 2021, we received additional financial support for Global Development Plan activities through a near-term milestone payment by Mundipharma of $11.145 million. Mundipharma is entitled to credit the full amount of this milestone payment toward future royalties payable to us, subject to a limit on the amount by which royalty payments to us may be reduced in any quarter. If Mundipharma has not fully credited the amount of such milestone payment toward royalties payable to us before the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024 and (ii) termination of the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement by Mundipharma, we will be obligated to refund the uncredited portion of such milestone payment to Mundipharma on the earlier of such dates.
In addition to the cost-sharing and the $11.145 million milestone payment described above, we received under the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement a $30 million upfront payment, and may receive up to $523.267 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments (which includes milestone payments on the Licensed Product and up to $25.076 million in regulatory milestone payments related to Subcutaneous Product that we will become eligible for should Mundipharma exercise its option with respect to Subcutaneous Product), as well as double-digit royalties on tiers of annual net sales of the Licensed Product in the Mundipharma Territory in the teens.
Termination. Either party may terminate the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement for uncured material breach by the other party. Mundipharma may terminate the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement at will, provided that if Mundipharma terminates the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement in its entirety prior to the last visit of the last patient in both the ReSPECT Trial and the ReSTORE Trial, Mundipharma will continue to be liable for its share of Global Development Costs as described above. We may terminate the Agreement if Mundipharma or any of its affiliates or sublicensees, directly or indirectly through any Third Party, commences any interference or opposition proceeding with respect to, challenges the validity or enforceability of, or opposes any extension of or the grant of a supplementary protection certificate with respect to, any of our patent rights licensed to Mundipharma, or upon an insolvency event of Mundipharma.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture supplies of rezafungin, any Cloudbreak development candidates, and any future product candidates.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce in the future, our product and development candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials utilizing reliable and reproducible processes and common manufacturing techniques. We obtain our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term arrangements, although we may consider entering into long-term supply arrangements to support the commercialization of rezafungin. In addition, we do not currently have any long-term arrangements in place for bulk drug substance or drug product services. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide bulk drug substance and drug product services prior to submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA as necessary to provide sufficient commercial quantities of each product.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, rezafungin, our AVCs, our Cloudbreak antiviral platform, our processes and our know-how are important to our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position through patent protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, obtain, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and/or potentially licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our inventions, improvements and technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
•obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
•defend and enforce our current and potential future patents;
•preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
•operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We have established, and will continue to build, proprietary positions for rezafungin, any other product candidates and technology in the United States and abroad. As of February 25, 2021, our patent portfolio included 11 families of patents and patent applications related to various aspects of rezafungin, and 19 families of patent applications related to our Cloudbreak antiviral platform.
For our issued patents related to rezafungin, we expect the last to expire in 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
With respect to our flu AVCs, the latest of any patents that result from our currently pending applications would be expected to expire in 2040, should they be issued, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
Market exclusivity is the exclusive marketing right granted by the FDA and certain foreign equivalents upon the approval of a drug if certain statutory requirements are met. When granted, the applicable regulatory authority will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication during the period of market exclusivity. The length of market exclusivity depends on the type of exclusivity granted. We intend to seek market exclusivity on our product candidates where appropriate.
The FDA has granted rezafungin designations as an Orphan Drug, QIDP and Fast Track for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis which together provide 12 years of marketing exclusivity in the United States to be granted at the time of FDA approval. The FDA has also granted rezafungin designations for QIDP and Fast Track for prophylactic use in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant which provides a five-year extension to any marketing exclusivity period for which the drug qualifies on approval.
The European Commission has granted rezafungin Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of invasive candidiasis which provides 10 years of market exclusivity protection from similar medicines with similar indications upon approval of the marketing authorization, and the potential for two additional years of market exclusivity when the results from pediatric studies compliant with an approved PIP are included in the SmPC.
Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection in several countries for the Cidara trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our pharmaceutical compounds. We currently have registered trademarks for the Cidara mark in the United States, the European Union, Australia and Canada, and we have a registered trademark for the Cloudbreak mark in the United States for our pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that rezafungin and any Cloudbreak development candidates we pursue in the future, paralleled with our scientific and development expertise in the field of anti-infectives, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
Rezafungin will primarily compete with antifungal classes for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. The approved branded therapies for this indication include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck & Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.) and Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.). There are generic versions of one or more of the current echinocandins available now, which will create added competition at the time of rezafungin regulatory approval. In addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Mylan Inc. and Glenmark Generics Inc., among others. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that rezafungin will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, such as SCY-078, which is being developed by Scynexis, Inc.
We expect that any antiviral drug candidates developed through our Cloudbreak antiviral platform for influenza will compete against approved vaccines for influenza and approved agents for the treatment of viral influenza infections, including neuraminidase inhibitors such as Tamiflu, Relenza, and Peramivir, and endonuclease inhibitors such as Xofluza. We intend to develop other product candidates through our Cloudbreak antiviral platform for the prevention and treatment of other viral infections. We are aware of a number of approved and investigational vaccines and/or therapies in these areas.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our Cloudbreak antiviral platform.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States Drug Approval Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•manufacturing of clinical supplies;
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises safety concerns or questions related to safety to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and/or the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months from filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Fast Track Designation
The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to use surrogate endpoints in the evaluation of the pivotal clinical trials and have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is received. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA’s criteria for priority review.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product and for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Qualified Infectious Disease Product Designation
In response to the growing unmet medical need in the area of serious bacterial and fungal infections, the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, is intended to provide incentives, including, for example, access to expedited FDA review for approval and five years of potential market exclusivity extension, for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products, or QIDP, including antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to treatment, or that treat qualifying resistant pathogens identified by the FDA. A sponsor must request QIDP designation for a new drug before an NDA is submitted. If designated as a QIDP and approved, the drug is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have otherwise been entitled. In addition, a QIDP receives NDA priority review and Fast Track designation.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications, but it may not issue a Written Request where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which an orphan drug designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMS, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product's FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Additional Health Care Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes certain requirements on covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of therapies in which our products are used. 
There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. 
Outside the United States, the commercialization of therapeutics is generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has, and will continue to, put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product candidates.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Healthcare Reform
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. There have been executive judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been enacted. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Additionally, in January 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. At the federal level there have been several presidential executive orders and U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the FDA released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID1-19 pandemic.

Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Employees
As of January 31, 2020, we had 79 total employees and 1 part-time employee, 20 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 59 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 21 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support.
