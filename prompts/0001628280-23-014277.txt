Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a technology-driven, leading provider of communications infrastructure services, power grid modernization, and renewables solutions to the telecommunications and utilities industries across the United States. We provide a variety of mission-critical services across the telecom and renewable energy value chain, including wireline and fiber optic terminations, wireless, fiber-to-the-home, or FTTH, and customer fulfillment activities. Our experienced management team has leveraged our technical expertise, rigorous quality and safety standards, and execution track record to establish and maintain long-standing relationships with blue-chip customers.
We operate two business segments: (i) Telecommunications ("Telecom") and (ii) Renewables & Recovery Logistics. Our Telecom segment provides engineering, construction, installation, network design, project management, site acquisition and maintenance service to major telecommunication, utility and cable carriers in various locations in the United States. Our Renewables & Recovery Logistics segment provides power utility, telecom and other businesses with continuity and disaster recovery operations, and provides new fiber optic construction services to renewable energy, commercial and utilities customers across the United States.
Telecommunications
We provide a full suite of services to the telecom sector across both wireless and wireline markets, from site acquisition and permitting to initial engineering and design to installation, maintenance, program management and fulfillment. Our core offerings consist of:
•Engineering and construction services including the design and construction of aerial and underground fiber optic and coaxial systems for homes, businesses, cell towers, and small cells.
•Installation services including the placement and splicing of fiber and coaxial cable, in addition to upgrades and new site builds for cellular towers.
•Site acquisition services to determine the location for new sites prior to new site builds.
•We also provide cable and satellite fulfillment services for residential and commercial customers. These services are provided for telecom companies in connection with the maintenance or expansion of new and existing networks.
While the telecommunications industry is naturally concentrated, we maintain customer diversification across our business segments. We have numerous long-established relationships with telephone companies, wireless carriers, multiple cable system operators and electric utilities companies, which have been built upon and cultivated through numerous Master Service Agreements ("MSA") that extend for periods of one or more years (majority are for three or more years, some of which have auto-renewal provisions). Blue-chip, investment grade customers including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Comcast comprise a substantial portion of our revenue.
Within our Telecom segment we also provide electrical contracting, and utility construction and maintenance services. We construct and maintain overhead and underground distribution systems for municipalities, electric membership cooperatives, and electric-utility companies.
Renewables and Recovery Logistics
We entered the renewable infrastructure sector with our acquisition of Fiber Network Solutions, LLC ("FNS") in January 2021. FNS is a full-service provider of fiber optic and electrical services, focusing primarily on renewable energy projects. Our capabilities include expertise in wind and solar farm fiber, installation and testing, Optical Ground Wire ("OPGW") and all-dielectric self-supporting ("ADSS") aerial transmission line installation, and large-scale data communication solutions and installation.

We also provide fiber optic terminations, Optical Time Domain Reflectometer ("OTDR") and power meter testing, fusion splicing, fiber placement, extensive fiber optic and copper infrastructure installation, cable jetting, boring and trenching, industry specific maintenance and material procurement.
Recovery Logistics ("RLI") has been providing basecamp, catering, fueling, transport logistics, power restoration, and generator maintenance services since 1999. Our basecamps house, feed and support thousands of linemen, first responders, and others when hurricanes and other catastrophic events hit in the United States.
Industry Overview
Telecommunications
Significant advances in technology and rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers have substantially increased demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. 
With the proliferation of mobile devices, advancements in the “internet of things,” or IoT, and segments of the workforce shifting to remote work as a result of COVID-19, network traffic is growing and is expected to continue to grow, generating demand for both wired and wireless connectivity. Increased data usage is driven by two key dynamics: (i) an increase in the number of internet-enabled devices per capita and (ii) an increase in connection speed.
COVID-19 has further catalyzed network traffic growth by creating permanent shifts away from the office and into the home. 
Low levels of fiber penetration and the continuing growth of North American 5G deployment currently present significant opportunities for sustained growth for businesses such as QualTek:
•Wireless: Major carriers have continued to expand wireless network capacity and density with accelerated development and planned implementation of 5G wireless technologies. The increased speed and capacity that will result from deployment of 5G technology will require additional and improved tower capacity with higher data frequencies, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small cells to “densify” network performance. Wireless technology will need to be supported by fiber backbone and as a result, many carriers have committed to investing in the fiber infrastructure buildout.
•Wired: Telecommunication companies have also deployed capital and initiatives to improve fiber connectivity. Importantly, with only about 60 million U.S. homes (about 43% as per the Fiber Broadband Association) passed with fiber in 2022, over 100 million U.S. homes represent opportunities for fiber passing over the next several years, indicating a massive investment cycle that is still in early stages.
Renewable and Recovery Logistics
In 2017 and 2018, solar photovoltaic and onshore wind cemented their dominance in the renewable energy market, representing on average a consolidated 77% of total finance commitments in renewable energy. The highly modular nature of these technologies, their short project development lead times, increasing competitiveness driven by technology and manufacturing improvements, and government regulations play an important role in explaining these technologies’ large share of global renewable energy investment.
The Biden administration is expected to amplify this increase in spending for renewable power projects. For example, since his first day in office, President Biden has rejoined the 2015 Paris Agreement, and set a goal to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. In addition, the August 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) contains provisions that are designed to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, reduce carbon emissions, lower energy prices and support the development of a reliable and affordable energy sector. The IRA provides almost $370 billion in clean energy funding to facilitate the clean energy transition, primarily in the form of tax incentives, grants and loan guarantees. Among the clean energy and climate provisions is approximately $70 billion of incentives over the next decade, including extensions of the renewable energy production tax credit and the investment tax credit for solar and other energy technologies, as well as production tax credits and investment tax credits for the qualified production of clean hydrogen and other clean fuels. As a result of the trends and factors discussed above, we expect a continuing increase in demand for construction of renewable and other clean energy infrastructure in the coming years.

Power utility companies, telecom carriers, and other entities rely on Recovery Logistics when disasters such as hurricanes hit the United States Catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable, and may increase in frequency and severity. Power utilities have mutual assistance agreements with each other that result in thousands of linemen mobilizing to impacted areas when power is out. Very few companies can provide the basecamps needed to accommodate the tens of thousands of linemen that must be housed, fed, and supported as they restore power. In addition, the expertise developed by Recovery Logistics to provide these basecamps translates well to other emergency response markets. There are many opportunities to expand this business going forward.
Competitive Strengths
Culture of Operational Excellence that Resonates with Established Blue-Chip Customer Base
QualTek analyzes and evaluates key performance metrics, such as customer satisfaction, technical issues in the field, hiring processes and working capital management. We have fostered a culture of continuous improvement and our operational excellence. Our decentralized operations create multiple points of contact with our customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Comcast thereby generating numerous individual relationships and contract opportunities per customer.
Highly Scalable Shared Services Platform Driven by Technology-Enabled Capabilities
QualTek provides full turnkey services to its customers. Our significant investment over the years to optimize our platform and technology has created a highly scalable business ready to support continued growth. For example, a centralized shared services system provides us with a competitive advantage for operational execution of customer services, process consistency and cross division sharing of “best practices,” resulting in enhanced efficiency and scalability. To maintain this operational excellence, we conduct disciplined measuring of KPIs with quality control for every division to ensure industry-leading execution capabilities.
Significant Revenue and Backlog
Our backlog consists of the estimated amount of revenue we expect to realize from future work on uncompleted contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. A significant portion of our 24-month backlog is attributable to MSAs and other service agreements, none of which require our customers to purchase minimum amounts of goods or services and can be terminated at will or on short notice. Backlog amounts are determined based on estimates that incorporate historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects, and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers.
QualTek maintains strong potential revenue visibility through its two-year estimated backlog. Consistent with standard practice across the industry, QualTek calculates its estimated backlog for work under MSAs and other service agreements (including issued purchase orders) based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects, and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. Our long-standing relationships with blue-chip, investment grade customers enable us to understand our customers’ needs and expand our backlog. Our backlog provides long-term visibility into a recurring revenue base. QualTek has an estimated $1.6 billion two-year backlog of which $1.5 billion relates to our Telecom segment and $0.1 billion relates to our Renewables & Recovery Logistics segment.
Backlog is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, GAAP results. Participants in our industry often disclose a calculation of their backlog; however, our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or if actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. Furthermore, our ability to execute projects within our backlog may be adversely impacted by factors such as our liquidity and workforce, including subcontractors. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.
Management Team
QualTek is led by a highly experienced management team that is positioned to capitalize on sector momentum. Our senior management team has an average of 21 years of individual industry experience. Our team is well suited to establish 

and maintain long-standing relationships with blue-chip customers as a result of our technical expertise, rigorous quality and safety standards, and execution track record.
Strategic Regional Presence across the U.S.
QualTek has a national footprint with approximately 65 strategically located service locations across the United States in close proximity to our major customers, allowing us to respond to customer demand swiftly and efficiently. Our presence in multiple regions gives us valuable insight into local market drivers and customer demand, thereby enabling us to provide bespoke services in each market. Due to this presence, QualTek has also built deep relationships with local customers that help drive business development, project execution, and cross-sell opportunities.
Growth Strategy
Expand Service Offerings & Solutions while Leveraging Established Customer Relationships
QualTek’s complementary service offering creates an opportunity for us to grow our business with customers in two fundamental ways: by winning more contracts and cross-selling services. We anticipate growth in our Telecom business as spectrum continues to become available. Additionally, we plan to cross-sell our full-suite of wireless services to our existing customer base.
In our Renewables & Recovery Logistics segment, we see significant opportunity to leverage existing customers and footprint for incremental projects. We also expect the Biden administration to promote more spending in renewables through government contracts and also in other sectors and businesses that will in turn reinvest in renewable energy solutions.
Expansion of our Recovery Logistics Business with Additional Deployments
We believe that our Recovery Logistics business is currently underutilized and is poised to provide assistance to the telecom industry and other industries for deployments beyond natural disasters such as hurricanes and winter storms. We intend to seek additional opportunities for the business to deploy its assets in new opportunities.
Our Services and Solutions
We are a reputable, one-stop infrastructure solutions provider at the epicenter of the 5G and renewables buildout. To serve our customers, we operate two distinct segments: Telecom, which includes our wireless and wireline engineering and construction services along with our electrical construction and maintenance services, and Renewables & Recovery Logistics.
Telecommunications
Our Telecom segment helps our clients build and maintain better, more reliable networks across the United States. We are able to provide technology-driven, field-based critical services across every stage of the network life-cycle for the telecommunications industry and power utility industry. This segment is composed of three sub-segments of services: wireless, wireline and power.

Our wind business comprises a majority of the revenue for our Renewables sub-segment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Advanced wind turbines include a large number of sensors whose signals are prone to contamination from electrical interference from lightning strikes. It is increasingly common to use fiber optics to galvanically isolate such interfaces, which is more difficult and costly with copper wires. This not only limits the damage of any lightning strikes but also can help reduce the effects of power line noise on sensitive sensor readings. Fiber optics are used for both galvanic isolation purposes and data communications. In addition, offshore turbines are often situated five plus miles from the control center on land, making routine maintenance difficult and costly. As a result, wind turbine operators increasingly rely on complex sensors to efficiently monitor and schedule routine maintenance. Fiber optic cables are the preferred choice from a reliability and ease of maintenance perspective, especially at scale.
Our solar business services help support solar power generation by ensuring that our clients’ farms are running safely and efficiently. In a solar farm power generation system, large amounts of currents are generated from the heat of the sun. In order to protect the equipment from current leakage, galvanic insulation becomes important to ensure the power system’s quality and reliability. Fiber optics offer insulation protection from high-voltage/current glitches and unwanted signals into power equipment controls and communication. In addition, fiber optic communication can cover longer link distance connections compared to copper wire. As the solar farms grow in size, monitoring and controlling all the solar panels requires long link distance connections, which is only possible with fiber optic cable.
Recovery Logistics
This sub-segment operates under the brand QualTek Recovery Logistics and provides business continuity, restoration, and disaster relief services to its clients, including AT&T, Verizon, Duke Energy, Gulf Power, Florida Power and Light, 

and Entergy, among others. QualTek Recovery Logistics has strategically staged basecamp assets in hurricane prone East and Gulf states to enable rapid deployment to any of these areas. Some other services offered include:
•Recovery Management
•Transport Logistics
•Temporary Shelter
•Network Recovery
•Fleet Services
•Energy Resources
•Catering
•Sanitation
Through our 2018 acquisition of Recovery Logistics, LLC (“RLI”), we transformed our recovery logistics sub-segment from a regional player with concentration in the Southeast to a fully national presence with a diversified customer base which can be served out of approximately 65 locations. RLI is a leading provider of business continuity and disaster recovery operations for the telecommunications and power utility sectors. RLI helps businesses recover from unplanned events, including hurricanes, winter storms and floods.
QualTek’s recent entry into the renewable energy space positions it to capitalize on sector tailwinds. Within Renewables, there is also significant opportunity for the Company to leverage its existing customer relationships, as well as its footprint, to gain traction and win incremental projects. This also applies to QualTek’s Recovery Logistics sub-segment, as the Company may be able to cross-sell recurring maintenance and recovery services to capture incremental revenue and deepen penetration with existing customer relationships. Providing recovery logistics capabilities offers another touchpoint for the Company to deliver high value-added services, underlining QualTek’s extensive repertoire of end-to-end services.
We believe that revenue will be propelled by the government’s focus and spending in the Renewables space, as well as QualTek’s commitment to expanding its service offerings and customer base, specifically in its Recovery Logistics sub-segment.
Contract Overview
QualTek has numerous MSAs with blue-chip customers that extend for periods of one or more years, with a majority for three or more years, some of which have automatic renewals, providing meaningful revenue visibility. Generally, the Company maintains multiple agreements with each customer as different geographies and scopes of work are individually priced. Pricing is generally based on a fixed price per unit basis with up to hundreds of units priced in a single contract. Many contracts specify discrete billing milestones for each job to be performed. As an agreed-upon milestone is achieved, QualTek may bill for the work performed. Purchase orders for discrete projects are generally issued under an MSA. This allows for quantity adjustments for the number of tasks/units that are performed with respect to a project. There are also other adjustments such as “rock adders” that accommodate changes in scope versus original engineering plans. MSAs have historically experienced high renewal rates.
QualTek utilizes a disciplined approach when bidding on new contracts and will decline to bid if management believes QualTek cannot deliver the quality that meets Company standards while achieving return targets. The Company’s approach in submitting a bid that meets target returns is based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to its:
•Experience in accurately understanding the scope of the work and associated margin
•Knowledge of local factors (i.e., resources, regional dynamics, work conditions, etc.) that will impact work to be performed

•Ability to simultaneously “lock-in” labor rates with contracts for the work to be performed on fixed price per unit basis (“back-to-back” agreements with contractors)
•Pass-through nature of material purchases
Due to the Company’s turnkey capabilities and high standard for quality control, QualTek often receives requests from customers to bid on new contract opportunities.
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are critical to our success. In order to best service our customers, QualTek utilizes a hybrid in-house & contracted labor model to flex our workforce. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a combined workforce of approximately 803 in the Midwest, 1,159 in the West, 635 in the Southwest, 908 in the Southeast, and 1,770 in the Northeast. The Northeast workforce includes approximately 100 corporate employees that support all regions. Our combined workforce of approximately 5,275 includes 1,947 employees and 3,328 contracted workers. Additionally, approximately 15% of our workforce is comprised of Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. Our executive leadership team averages over 21 years of industry or functional experience.

Government Regulations
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated 

industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight.
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, as a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including:
•regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state equivalents;
•regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation;
•contractor licensing requirements;
•permitting and inspection requirements; and
•building and electrical codes.
We are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species and critical habitats.
We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business.
In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur unanticipated and substantial costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters.
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory and environmental requirements. We could, however, incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such requirements.
The potential effects of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, major changes in weather patterns could have a significant effect on our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability. Climate change could also affect our customers and the projects that they award. Demand for power projects or other projects could be negatively affected by significant changes in weather or from legislation or regulations governing climate change. Conversely, increased catastrophic weather events could favorably impact the revenue and profitability of our Recovery Logistics business.
