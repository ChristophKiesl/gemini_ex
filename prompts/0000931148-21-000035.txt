Item 1.Business
Our company
GrafTech International Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of high-quality graphite electrode products essential to the production of electric arc furnace ("EAF") steel and other ferrous and non-ferrous metals. We believe that we have the most competitive portfolio of low-cost ultra-high power (“UHP”) graphite electrode manufacturing facilities in the industry, including three of the highest capacity facilities in the world. We are the only large scale graphite electrode producer that is substantially vertically integrated into petroleum needle coke, a key raw material for graphite electrode manufacturing. This unique position provides us with competitive advantages in product quality and cost. Founded in 1886, we have 135 years of experience in the research and development (“R&D”) of graphite- and carbon-based solutions, and our intellectual property portfolio is extensive. We currently have graphite electrode manufacturing facilities in Calais, France, Pamplona, Spain, Monterrey, Mexico and St. Marys, Pennsylvania. Our customers include major steel producers and other ferrous and non-ferrous metal producers in Europe, Russia and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries, the Middle East and Africa (collectively, “EMEA”), the Americas and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”), which sell their products into the automotive, construction, appliance, machinery, equipment and transportation industries. Our vision is to provide highly engineered graphite electrode services, solutions and products to EAF operators. Based on the high-quality of our graphite electrodes, reliability of our petroleum needle coke supply and our excellent customer service, we believe that we are viewed as a preferred supplier to the global EAF steel producer market.
Graphite electrodes are an industrial consumable product used primarily in EAF steel production, one of the two primary methods of steel production and the steelmaking technology used by all “mini‑mills.” Electrodes act as conductors of electricity in the furnace, generating sufficient heat to melt scrap metal, iron ore or other raw materials used to produce steel or other metals. We estimate that, on average, the cost of graphite electrodes represents only approximately 1% to 5% of the total production cost of steel in a typical EAF, but they are essential to EAF steel production. Graphite electrodes are currently the only known commercially available products that have the high levels of electrical conductivity and the capability to sustain the high levels of heat generated in EAF steel production. As a result, EAF steel manufacturers require a reliable supply of high-quality graphite electrodes. Graphite electrodes are also used in steel refining in ladle furnaces and in other processes, such as the production of titanium dioxide, stainless steel, aluminum, silicon metals and other ferrous and non‑ferrous metals.
With the growth of EAF production, electrode production has become focused on the manufacture of UHP electrodes. The production of UHP electrodes requires an extensive proprietary manufacturing process and material science knowledge, including the use of higher quality needle coke blends. We primarily compete in the UHP graphite electrode market.
Petroleum needle coke, a crystalline form of carbon derived from decant oil, is the key raw material we use in the production of graphite electrodes. We achieved substantial vertical integration with this critical raw material source through our acquisition of Seadrift Coke L.P. (“Seadrift”) in November 2010, significantly reducing our reliance on other suppliers. The petroleum needle coke industry is highly concentrated. We believe Seadrift is one of the largest petroleum needle coke producers in the world. We also believe that the quality of Seadrift’s petroleum needle coke is superior for graphite electrode production compared to most of the petroleum needle coke available to our peers on the open market, allowing us to produce high-quality electrodes in a cost‑efficient manner. Additionally, we believe that this vertical integration provides a significant cost advantage relative to our competitors. 
As a leading producer of graphite electrodes, we believe we are well-positioned to be a key provider to the EAF steel making industry. In 2018, we completed an operational improvement and debottlenecking initiative to increase production capacity at our three primary operating facilities in Calais, France, Pamplona, Spain, and Monterrey, Mexico, by approximately 

20% to a total of 202,000 metric tons (“MT”). We have begun a series of projects at our Monterrey and St. Marys facilities that will shift graphitization and machining of additional volume of semi-finished product from Monterrey to St. Marys. We expect 
these projects will further optimize our manufacturing footprint by improving environmental performance and production flexibility at both facilities and also leverage cost efficiencies at our St. Marys facility.
Graphite electrodes are an essential consumable in the EAF steel production process and require a long lead time to manufacture, and our strategic customers are highly focused on securing certainty of supply of reliable, high-quality graphite electrodes. We believe we are uniquely capable among graphite electrode producers to pursue our long-term take‑or‑pay contracting strategy due to our substantial vertical integration into petroleum needle coke production.
On August 15, 2015, we became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (together with its affiliates, "Brookfield"). In April 2018, we completed our initial public offering ("IPO"). Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “EAF.” Brookfield owned approximately 55.3% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020 and 47.8% as of February 16, 2021.
Our executive offices are located at 982 Keynote Circle, Brooklyn Heights, Ohio 44131 and our telephone number is (216) 676‑2000. Our website address is www.graftech.com. Information on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this Annual Report. We have included our website address only as an inactive textual reference and do not intend it to be an active link to our website.
Competitive strengths
We are one of the largest producers of graphite electrodes in the world, accounting for approximately a quarter of global production capacity (excluding China), and we believe our strategically positioned global footprint provides us with competitive advantages.
We believe our facilities are among the most strategically located and lowest cost, large‑scale graphite electrode manufacturing plants in the world. Of the graphite electrode manufacturing facilities currently operating, we estimate that our three primary operating manufacturing facilities represent approximately a quarter of estimated production capacity for graphite electrodes outside of China, making us a critical supplier to global EAF steel manufacturers. Our manufacturing facilities are located in the Americas and EMEA, providing us with access to low‑cost and reliable energy sources, logistical and freight advantages in sourcing raw materials and shipping our graphite electrodes to our customers compared to our competitors, and excellent visibility into the large North American and European EAF steelmaking markets. Our experience in producing graphite electrodes for a varied global customer base positions us to meet customer requirements across a range of product types and quality levels, including support and technical services, further distinguishing us from our competitors.
We are a pure‑play provider of an essential consumable for EAF steel producers, the fastest‑growing sector of the steel industry.
According to the World Steel Association (“WSA”), since 2000, EAF steelmaking grew at an annual pace of approximately 3%, compared with 1% for steelmaking overall, excluding China. As a result of the increasing global availability of steel scrap and the more resilient, high‑variable cost and environmentally friendly EAF model, we expect EAF steel producers to continue to grow at a faster rate than blast oxygen furnace ("BOF") producers globally. Additionally, EAF steel producers are increasingly able to utilize higher quality scrap and iron units, their two primary raw materials, to produce higher quality steel grades and capture market share from BOF producers, while maintaining a favorable cost structure. The EAF method produces approximately 25% of the carbon dioxide (“CO”) emissions of a BOF facility and does not require the smelting of virgin iron ore or the burning of coal. Additionally, as a result of significantly increased steel production in China since 2000, the supply of Chinese scrap is expected to increase substantially, which may result in lower scrap prices and provide the Chinese steel manufacturing industry with local scrap feedstock that was not historically available. We believe these trends will allow EAF steel producers to increase their market share and grow at a faster rate than BOF steel producers resulting in increasing demand for graphite electrodes.
We believe we have the industry’s most efficient production platform of high production capacity assets with substantial vertical integration.
Over the past decade, we have rationalized inefficient plants during the downturn and more recently completed a manufacturing footprint optimization program. We believe that the optimization of our graphite electrode plant network will continue to drive improved fixed cost absorption. Moreover, our Calais, Pamplona, Monterrey and St. Marys facilities each provides unique cost advantages given its scale and access to low cost, reliable energy sources.
Seadrift provides a substantial portion of our petroleum needle coke supply needs internally at a competitive cost and allows us to maximize capacity utilization more efficiently than competitors, who may be more constrained by a limited or

costly petroleum needle coke supply. Seadrift is one of only five petroleum needle coke facilities in the world outside of China, and we believe it is one of the largest petroleum needle coke producers in the world.
We are the only petroleum needle coke producer in the world specifically focused on the production of graphite electrodes.
Our production of petroleum needle coke specifically for graphite electrodes provides us the opportunity to produce super premium petroleum needle coke of the highest quality and allows us to tailor graphite electrodes for customer requirements. Seadrift has approximately 140,000 MT of petroleum needle coke production capacity, which we believe makes it one of the largest petroleum needle coke producers in the world. Sourcing the majority of our petroleum needle coke internally allows us to offer our customers certainty of supply, further enhancing our competitive position and supporting our long-term take‑or‑pay contracts strategy. To align with our long-term contract profile, we have hedged the decant oil required to produce substantially all of the graphite electrodes sold under these contracts, providing us with substantial visibility into our future raw material costs. We believe our use of petroleum needle coke is a further competitive advantage, as the use of pitch needle coke, an alternative raw material, results in longer bake times during graphite electrode production.
We provide highly engineered graphite electrode products and are competitively positioned to provide services and solutions to EAF operators.
We utilize our own R&D facility as well as process engineers located at plant sites to constantly work at process and product improvements. This work has yielded the development of new products over the last 18 months, which have improved our competitive position. In addition, we believe that our ArchiTech Furnace Productivity System (“ArchiTech”) continues to provide a competitive advantage. ArchiTech, which has been installed at customer furnaces around the world, enables our engineers to work with our customers seamlessly to maximize the performance of their furnaces and provide real‑time diagnostics and troubleshooting. This remote functionality has been particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our customers value our high-quality products and customer service, which subsequently improves our commercial opportunities.
Our experienced executive leadership and general managers and flexible workforce have positioned us for future earnings growth.
Our seasoned leadership is committed to earnings growth. Our executive and manufacturing leadership have led manufacturing companies through many cycles and are focused on positioning us for profitable growth in any environment. We have undertaken strategic investments to increase our production capacity in a capital‑efficient manner while reducing our cost position. 
Graphite electrode industry
EAF steel producers are the primary consumers of graphite electrodes. The size of the electrodes varies depending on the size of the furnace, the size of the furnace’s electric transformer and the planned productivity of the furnace. In a typical furnace using alternating electric current and operating at a typical number of production cycles per day, three electrodes are fully consumed (requiring the addition of new electrodes), on average, every 8 to 10 operating hours. UHP graphite electrodes are consumed at a rate of approximately 1.7 kilograms per MT of steel production in EAF facilities.
The actual rate of consumption and addition of electrodes for a particular furnace depends primarily on the efficiency and productivity of the furnace. Therefore, demand for graphite electrodes is directly related to the amount and efficiency of EAF steel production. EAF steel production requires significant heat (as high as 5,000° F) to melt the raw materials, primarily scrap metal, in the furnace. Heat is generated as electricity (as much as 150,000 amps) passes through the electrodes and creates an electric arc between the electrodes and the raw materials.
The industry is fairly consolidated, particularly outside of China. The five largest global producers in the industry are Showa Denko K.K., GrafTech, Fangda Carbon New Material Technology Co. LTD, Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd. and Graphite India Limited. 
Supply trends
We estimate that from 2014 to 2016, the industry closed or repurposed approximately 20% of global production capacity outside of China, consisting of smaller, higher cost facilities. Based on our experience, high capacity manufacturing facilities can have a significant operating cost advantage as compared to low capacity manufacturing facilities, encouraging producers to consolidate facilities in order to reduce costs. We believe the majority of the production capacity reduction was permanent due to the demolition, long-term environmental remediation and repurposing of most of these lower capacity facilities. Notwithstanding the current market challenges, the consolidation and production capacity reductions in the graphite electrode industry, along with the EAF steel industry’s recovery since 2016, lead us to believe that the graphite electrode industry will resume its long-term growth trajectory as the global steel industry recovers from the pandemic.

Demand trends
Our graphite electrodes are primarily used in the EAF steelmaking process, and long-term global growth in that market has driven increased demand for graphite electrodes. EAF steelmaking has historically been the fastest-growing segment of the global steel market. According to the WSA, global EAF steel production grew at a 3.1% compound annual growth rate from 1984 to 2019, while taking market share from other methods of steelmaking in most regions of the world, outside of China. EAF steel producers benefit from their flexibility in sourcing iron units, being able to make steel from either scrap or alternative sources of iron like direct reduced iron and hot briquetted iron, both made directly from iron ore. Most of the growth in EAF steelmaking has taken place in Western Europe and North America, two regions with substantial amounts of scrap available for use in EAFs.

EAF Steel Production's Outlook
Since 2015, the EAF steel industry has grown at a 6.4% compound annual rate according to the WSA. This recovery has taken place since China began to restructure its steel industry, encouraging consolidation and shutting down excess capacity. China has also begun to implement environmental regulations to improve air quality impacted by CO2 emissions associated with the burning of coal in BOF steelmaking. Additionally, trade remedies in developed economies such as North America and Western Europe are protecting their domestic steel industries against imports from BOF-steel producing countries, which has resulted in a significant decrease in Chinese steel exports. According to China Customs and Baiinfo, Chinese steel exports declined from 112 million MT in 2015 to 54 million MT in 2020. This resulted in increased steel production outside of China, benefiting EAF steel production. 
We believe there is a particular opportunity for EAF steelmaking to take further market share in China as well. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's current draft guidelines call for EAF steelmaking to constitute 20% of overall steel production by 2025, doubling its current share of output. If Chinese EAF steelmaking production capacity were to reach 20%, based on 2019 production levels, that would add 96 million MT of additional EAF steel production for a total of 199 million MT, compared to 2019 EAF steel production in the next largest regions of 90 million MT in Europe, 81 million MT in North America and 63 million MT in India, according to WSA.

Pricing trends
Pricing for graphite electrodes is determined through contract negotiations and spot transactions between producers and consumers. Pricing has historically been cyclical, reflecting the demand trends of the global EAF steelmaking industry and supply of graphite electrodes. Moreover, as petroleum needle coke represents a significant percentage of the raw material cost of graphite electrodes, graphite electrodes have typically been priced at a spread to petroleum needle coke. Over the period from 2008 to 2017, the average graphite electrode spread over petroleum needle coke was approximately $3,200 per MT, on an inflation-adjusted basis using constant 2020 dollars. In tight demand markets, this spread has increased, resulting in higher graphite electrode prices. 
There is no widely accepted graphite electrode reference price. Historically, between 2008 and 2017, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes was approximately $4,800 per MT (on an inflation-adjusted basis using constant 

2020 dollars). During the last demand trough in 2016, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes fell to approximately $2,500 per MT in 2016. Following the significant rationalization of graphite electrode production globally, the resumption of growth in EAF steel production, falling scrap prices, reductions in Chinese steel exports, and constrained supply of needle coke, graphite electrode spot prices began to increase in late 2017 and reached record high prices in 2018. These record high spot prices began to retreat in 2019, falling 25% during the year. Prices continued to decline throughout 2020. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, our average price from long-term agreements ("LTAs") was approximately $9,600 per MT and our average price for non-LTA business was approximately $4,900 per MT. 
Market prices for graphite electrodes declined throughout 2020, including through the fourth quarter and into the early part of the first quarter of 2021. There is a lag between the time we negotiate price for non-LTA sales and when our electrodes are delivered and recognized in revenue. We estimate that our non-LTA price for electrodes delivered and recognized in revenue for the first six weeks of 2021 averaged approximately $4,200 per MT. Given this impact, for the first half of 2021 we anticipate earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA will decline by high single digits, on a percentage basis, compared to the first half of 2020. We believe market prices for graphite electrodes are now improving and expect this to positively impact our financial results beginning in the second half of 2021.
Needle coke industry
Introduction
Needle coke is the primary raw material for the production of graphite electrodes used by EAF steelmakers and producers of aluminum, stainless steel, silicon metals and other ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and is also a primary raw material in the production of lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles. Needle coke is derived from two carbon sources. Petroleum needle coke is produced through a manufacturing process very similar to a refinery. The production process converts decant oil, a byproduct of the gasoline refining process, into petroleum needle coke and generally takes two to three months to produce. Pitch needle coke, used principally by Asian graphite electrode manufacturers, is made from coal tar pitch, a byproduct of coking metallurgical coal used in BOF steelmaking.
Graphite electrode producers combine petroleum needle coke and pitch needle coke with binders and other ingredients to form graphite electrodes. Petroleum needle coke and pitch needle coke, relative to other varieties of coke, are distinguished by their needle-like structure and their quality, which is measured by the presence of impurities, principally sulfur, nitrogen and ash. Petroleum needle coke and pitch needle coke are typically low in these impurities. Additionally, the needle-like structure of petroleum and pitch needle coke creates expansion along the length of the electrode, rather than the width, which reduces the likelihood of fractures. In order to minimize fractures caused by disproportionate expansion over the width of an electrode, and minimize the effect of impurities, large-diameter graphite electrodes (18 inches to 32 inches) employed in high-intensity EAF applications are comprised almost exclusively of petroleum needle coke and pitch needle coke.
The process map below shows the raw materials required to make graphite electrodes, the various consumers of these raw materials, as well as the consumers of graphite electrodes.
Source: Management estimates
Previously, producers of petroleum needle coke typically agreed to supply petroleum needle coke in twelve-month contracts; however, since 2017, producers of petroleum needle coke have typically used six-month contracts. As a result, our competitors must continually renegotiate supply agreements in response to changing market conditions. We are substantially vertically integrated through our ownership of our Seadrift facility, which provides the majority of our needle coke requirements and insulates us from rapid changes in the needle coke market.
Market size and major producers
The needle coke industry is concentrated. We estimate that Seadrift has approximately one-fifth of the petroleum needle coke production capacity outside China.
Graphite electrode manufacturers prefer petroleum needle coke because of the meaningfully longer bake and graphitizing time required for pitch needle coke. Additionally, the demand for petroleum needle coke in lithium-ion battery manufacturing is growing rapidly. Electric vehicle manufacturers prefer artificial graphite such as petroleum needle coke in lithium-ion batteries because of its greater energy density, providing batteries with longer driving ranges and longevity.

Industry trends
Petroleum needle coke production capacity outside of China has remained unchanged for at least the last ten years due to the capital intensity, technical know-how and long lead times required to build greenfield needle coke production facilities and the stringent regulatory process associated with building new needle coke production capacity. Furthermore, we believe that brownfield expansion opportunities in developed countries are generally not available as petroleum needle coke manufacturing is a continuous process with significant costs associated with shutting down and restarting facilities for maintenance or capital investment. 
While the vast majority of petroleum needle coke is used in the production of graphite electrodes, the use of needle coke in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles is growing with the increased production of these vehicles. According to the International Energy Agency ("IEA"), the global electric car fleet exceeded seven million in 2019, as compared to 17,000 in 2010. The IEA projects that global annual sales of electric cars may range between 13 million and 25 million by 2025. Most electric vehicles rely on lithium-ion batteries as their key performance component. Many manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles use needle coke as a raw material for carbon anodes in their batteries due to advantages in terms of charging rate and capacity. According to IEA, battery pack capacity has been increasing in recent years and is expected to continue. Based on IEA’s estimates for electric vehicle sales and battery pack size, and management estimates for needle coke used in anodes, demand for needle coke from electric vehicles could grow significantly from over 200,000 MT in 2020 to over 700,000 MT in 2025.2
Contracts and Customers
In 2017, we reoriented our commercial strategy around a long-term take-or-pay contract framework and restructured our sales force incentives. As graphite electrodes are an essential consumable in the EAF steel production process and require a long lead time to manufacture, we believe our strategic customers are highly focused on securing certainty of supply of reliable, high-quality graphite electrodes. Prior to our long-term take-or-pay contract initiative, our sales of graphite electrodes were generally negotiated annually through purchase orders on an uncontracted, nonbinding basis. The majority of our customers sought to secure orders for a supply of their anticipated volume requirements each upcoming year. The remaining, small balance of our graphite electrode customers purchased their electrodes as needed throughout the year at industry spot prices.
We believe we are uniquely capable among graphite electrode producers to pursue our long-term take-or-pay contracting strategy due to our substantial vertical integration into petroleum needle coke production. All of our petroleum needle coke production is used internally and is not sold to external customers. Demand for petroleum needle coke increased due to the use of needle coke in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, as well as increased demand for graphite electrodes. Consequently, we expect this limited availability of petroleum needle coke will restrict new graphite electrode production. Seadrift, our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired in 2010, provides the majority of our petroleum needle coke requirements and produces sufficient needle coke to supply substantially all of the graphite electrode production that we have contracted under our long-term take-or-pay contracts. We have also hedged the decant oil required to produce substantially all of the graphite electrodes sold under these contracts, providing us substantial visibility into our future raw material costs.
Because the market price of graphite electrodes may be based, in part, on the current or forecasted costs of key raw materials, periods of raw material price volatility may have an impact on the market price. In particular, as petroleum needle coke represents a significant percentage of the raw material cost of graphite electrodes, the price of graphite electrodes has historically been influenced by the price of petroleum needle coke. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and industry—Pricing for graphite electrodes has historically been cyclical, current prices are receding from recent highs, and the price of graphite electrodes may continue to decline in the future.” The fixed prices under our contracts prevent us from passing along changes related to our costs of raw materials to our customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and industry—We are dependent on the supply of petroleum needle coke. Our results of operations could deteriorate if recent disruptions in the supply of petroleum needle coke continue or worsen for an extended period.” However, as described above, we believe our ability to source all of our petroleum needle coke requirements for these contracts from our Seadrift facility and our hedging of our purchases of decant oil mitigates the impact of periodic shortages and price fluctuations of raw materials. 
All of our long-term take-or-pay contracts have fixed prices. Within this contract framework, our customers agree to purchase a specified volume of product at the price under the contract. Contract customers are unable to renegotiate or adjust the price under the contract. These fixed prices under the contracts also prevent us from passing along any changes related to the costs of raw materials to contract customers. As a result of the long-term take-or-pay obligation of the contracts, the

Anode material is assumed to be approximately 50% synthetic and 50% natural graphite, with a yield of 50%.

customer must purchase the annual contracted volume (or annual volume within the specified range). In the event the customer does not take delivery of the annual volume specified in the contract, our contracts provide for a capacity payment equal to the product of the number of MTs short of the annual volume specified in the contract multiplied by the price under the contract for that contract year. 
In addition to defining annual volumes and prices, these long-term take-or-pay contracts include significant termination payments (typically, 50% to 70% of remaining contracted revenue) and, in certain cases, parent guarantees and collateral arrangements to manage our customer credit risk. In most cases, the customer can only terminate the contract unilaterally: (i) upon certain bankruptcy events; (ii) if we materially breach certain anti-corruption legislation; (iii) if we are affected by a force majeure event that precludes the delivery of the agreed-to graphite electrodes for more than a six-month period; or (iv) if we fail to ship certain minimum levels during a specified period of time. The customer will also be able to temporarily suspend obligations under the contract due to a force majeure event, as will we, with the contract term being extended by a period equal to the duration of such suspension.
Our contracts provide our customers with certain remedies in the event that we are unable to deliver the contracted volumes of graphite electrodes on a quarterly basis. Our substantially vertically integrated Seadrift plant is particularly important to our ability to provide our customers with a reliable supply of graphite electrodes. Therefore, the likelihood that we will fail to deliver the contracted volume is significantly reduced due to our substantial vertical integration. For a discussion of certain risks related to our long-term take-or-pay contracting initiative, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and industry—We may be unable to implement our business strategies, including our initiative to secure and maintain long-term take-or-pay customer contracts, in an effective manner.”

2020 Revenue and production by region and end market
Approximately 94% of our graphite electrodes were purchased by EAF steel producers in 2020. The remaining portion is primarily used in various other ferrous and non-ferrous melting applications, fused materials, chemical processing, and alloy metals. We sell our products in every major geographic region globally. Sales of our products to buyers outside the United States accounted for approximately 79% of net sales in 2020 and 77% of net sales in each of 2018 and 2019. Overall, in 2020, we generated 90% of our net sales from EMEA and the Americas.
We believe our long-term take-or-pay contracting strategy provides us with cash flow visibility and has secured a high-quality customer base. We perform financial and credit reviews of all eligible potential customers prior to entering into these contracts. Less creditworthy customers are required to post a bank guarantee, letter of credit or significant cash prepayment. Sales from our long-term take-or-pay contracts represented 87% and 80% of our net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Sales and customer service
We differentiate and sell the value of our graphite electrodes primarily based on price, product quality and performance, delivery reliability and customer technical service.
We have a large customer technical service organization, with supporting application engineering and scientific groups and more than 30 engineers and specialists around the world serving in this area. We believe that we are one of the industry leaders in providing value added technical services to our customers.

Our direct sales force currently operates from ten sales offices located around the world. We sell our graphite electrodes primarily through our direct sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors, all of whom are trained and experienced with our products.
We have customer technical service personnel based around the world to assist customers to maximize their production and minimize their costs. A portion of our engineers and technicians provide technical service and advice to key steel and other metals customers. These services relate to furnace applications and operation, as well as furnace upgrades to reduce energy consumption, improve raw material costs and increase output.
We believe we have a competitive advantage in offering customers ArchiTech, which we believe is an advanced support and technical service platform in the graphite electrode industry. ArchiTech, which has been installed in customer furnaces worldwide, enables our engineers to work with our customers seamlessly to maximize the performance of their furnaces and provide real-time diagnostics and troubleshooting.
Distribution
We deploy various demand management and inventory management techniques to seek to ensure that we can meet our customers’ delivery requirements while still maximizing the capacity utilization of our production capacity. We can experience significant variation in our customers’ delivery requirements as their specific needs vary and change through the year. We generally seek to maintain appropriate inventory levels, taking into account these factors as well as the significant differences in manufacturing cycle times for graphite electrode products and our customers’ products.
Finished products are usually stored at our manufacturing facilities. Limited quantities of some finished products are also stored at local warehouses around the world to meet customer needs.
Facilities
We currently manufacture our graphite electrodes in three primary manufacturing facilities strategically located in the Americas and EMEA, two of the largest EAF steelmaking markets. Our locations allow us to serve our customers in the Americas and EMEA efficiently. We believe that we have approximately 202,000 MT of graphite electrode production capacity at our operating sites in Calais, France, Pamplona, Spain, and Monterrey, Mexico.3 In addition to these three facilities, we have a fourth graphite electrode manufacturing site in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. We have begun a series of projects at our Monterrey and St. Marys facilities that will shift graphitization and machining of additional volume of semi-finished product from Monterrey to St. Marys. We expect these projects will further optimize our manufacturing footprint by improving environmental performance and production flexibility at both facilities and also leverage cost efficiencies at our St. Marys facility. We believe that our business has the lowest manufacturing cost structure of all of our major competitors, primarily due to the large scale of our manufacturing facilities.
Our manufacturing facilities significantly benefit from their size and scale, work force flexibility, access to attractively-priced sources of power and other key raw materials, and our substantial vertical integration with Seadrift. Our Calais, Pamplona, Monterrey and St Marys facilities have access to low-cost sources of electricity with essential logistical infrastructure in place, which is a significant element of our manufacturing costs. Our Seadrift facility currently produces the majority of our petroleum needle coke requirements for our graphite electrode production, allowing us to source our primary raw material internally and at cost, a significant advantage relative to our peers. Seadrift also produces sufficient needle coke to supply substantially all of the graphite electrode production that we have contracted under our long-term take-or-pay contracts.
Manufacturing
We manufacture graphite electrodes ranging in size up to 30 inches in diameter, over 11 feet in length, and weighing as much as 5,900 pounds (2.6 MT). The manufacturing process includes six main processes: screening of raw materials (needle coke) and blending with coal tar pitch followed by forming, or extrusion, of the electrode, baking the electrode, impregnating the electrode with a special pitch that improves strength, re-baking the electrode, graphitizing the electrode using electric resistance furnaces, and machining. The first baking process converts the pitch into hard coke. During the baking process, the electrode pitch volatiles are removed, leaving porosities inside. To improve graphite electrode quality, the electrode is then impregnated with additional coal tar pitch to fill the porosities and baked a second time. After impregnation and re-baking, the manufacturing process continues with graphitization as the electrodes are heated at 5000° F in a special longitudinal furnace to

convert the carbon into graphite. The graphitization cycle removes additional impurities and improves the electrodes’ key qualities: thermal and electrical conductivity, thermal shock resistance performance, lubricity, and abrasion resistance. 
High-quality graphite electrodes have low electrical resistivity and strong durability. Resistivity is enhanced by removing impurities during the production process, while durability is determined by the coefficient of thermal expansion (“CTE”) of the raw material used to produce the graphite electrode. Lower CTE needle coke produces higher quality electrodes. UHP electrodes used in harsh EAF melter applications have low resistivity and low CTE to maximize efficient use of electricity in the EAF and minimize electrode consumption. The total manufacturing time of a graphite electrode and its associated connecting pin is on average approximately six months from needle coke production to customer delivery. We believe that the period of time required to produce a graphite electrode meaningfully constrains the ability of graphite electrode producers to react to real-time changes in steel market environments and acts as a barrier to entry.
Production of a graphite electrode begins with the production of either petroleum needle coke, our primary raw material, or pitch needle coke. Petroleum needle coke is produced through a manufacturing process very similar to a refinery. The production process converts decant oil, a byproduct of the gasoline refining process, into petroleum needle coke and generally takes two to three months to produce. Needle coke takes its name from the needle-like shape of the coke particles. We produce calcined petroleum needle coke at Seadrift. Seadrift is not dependent on any single refinery for decant oil. While Seadrift has purchased a substantial majority of its raw material inventory from a limited number of suppliers in recent years, we believe that there is a large supply of suitable decant oil in the United States available from a variety of sources. In addition, we use derivatives to hedge the decant oil required to produce substantially all of the graphite electrodes sold under our long-term take-or-pay contracts, providing us with substantial visibility into our future raw material costs.
We purchase the electric power used in our manufacturing processes from local suppliers under contracts with pricing based on rate schedules or price indices. Our electricity costs can vary significantly depending on these rates and usage. Natural gas used in the baking and re-baking processes is purchased from local suppliers primarily under annual volume contracts with pricing based on various natural gas price indices.
Research and development
We have 135 years of experience in the R&D of graphite- and carbon-based solutions. By focusing our management’s attention and R&D spending exclusively on the graphite electrode business, we have been able to improve the quality of our graphite electrodes, repositioning ourselves as an industry leader and improving our relationships with strategic customers. Our focus on improving the quality of petroleum needle coke through R&D has led to our petroleum needle coke production at Seadrift being best-in-class for use in the manufacturing of highly durable UHP electrodes. We believe that the above strengths and capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage.
Intellectual property
We believe that our intellectual property, consisting primarily of patents and proprietary know-how, provides us with competitive advantages and is important to our growth opportunities. Our intellectual property portfolio is extensive, with over 150 carbon and graphite U.S. and foreign patents and published patent applications, which we believe is more than any of our major competitors in the businesses in which we operate.
We own, have the right to use or have obtained licenses for various trade names and trademarks used in our businesses. For example, the trade name and trademark UCAR are owned by Union Carbide Corporation (which was acquired by Dow Chemical Company) and are licensed to us on a worldwide, exclusive and royalty-free basis until 2025. This particular license automatically renews for successive ten-year periods. It permits non-renewal by Union Carbide at the end of any renewal period upon five years’ notice of non-renewal.
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as appropriate agreements to protect our intellectual property. Among other things, we seek to protect our proprietary know-how and information, by requiring employees, consultants, strategic partners and others who have access to such proprietary information and know-how to enter into confidentiality or restricted use agreements.
Insurance
We maintain insurance against civil liabilities relating to personal injuries to third parties, for loss of or damage to property, for business interruptions and for certain environmental matters, that provides coverage, subject to the applicable coverage limits, deductibles and retentions, and exclusions, that we believe are appropriate upon terms and conditions and for premiums that we consider fair and reasonable in the circumstances. There can be no assurance that we will not incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of our insurance.
Regulatory Matters
Environmental
Our facilities and operations are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to air emissions, water discharges and solid and hazardous waste generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal; the presence of wastes and other substances; the reporting of, responses to and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment; and the import, production, packaging, labeling and transportation of products that are defined as hazardous or toxic or otherwise believed to have potential to harm the environment or human health. These laws and regulations (and the enforcement thereof) are periodically updated and are becoming increasingly stringent. We have incurred substantial costs in the past, and will continue to incur additional costs in the future, to comply with these legal requirements.
We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny at most of our current and former facilities and, in some cases, have been required to take or are continuing to take corrective or remedial actions and incur related costs, and may experience further regulatory scrutiny, and may be required to take further corrective or remedial actions and incur additional costs, in the future. Although it has not been the case in the past, these costs could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.
Further, laws and regulations in various jurisdictions impose or may impose, as the case may be, environmental monitoring, reporting and/or remediation requirements if operations cease or property is transferred or sold. We have sold or closed a number of facilities that had operated solid waste management units (landfills) on-site. In most cases where we divested the properties, we have retained ownership of on-site landfills. When our landfills were or are to be sold, we negotiate for contractual provisions providing for financial assurance to be maintained, which we believe will be adequate to protect us from any potential future liability associated with these landfills. When we have closed landfills, we believe that we have done so in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We continue to monitor these landfills and observe any reporting obligations we may have with respect to them pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. To date, the costs associated with the retained landfills have not had, and we do not anticipate that future costs will have, a material adverse effect on us.
We have received and may in the future receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state environmental protection agencies, as well as claims from other parties, alleging that we are a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund Act”) and similar state laws for past and future remediation costs at waste disposal sites and other contaminated properties. Although Superfund Act liability is joint and several, in general, final allocation of responsibility at sites where there are multiple PRPs is made based on each PRP’s relative contribution of hazardous substances to the site. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that any potential liability we may have as a PRP will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Certain of our U.S. facilities have been or will be required to comply with reporting requirements under the Federal Clean Air Act and standards for air emissions that have been or may be adopted by the EPA and state environmental protection agencies pursuant to new and revised regulations, including the possible promulgation of future maximum achievable control technology standards that apply specifically to our manufacturing sector(s), or more generally to our operation(s) or equipment. Achieving compliance with the regulations that have been promulgated to date has resulted in the need for additional administrative and engineered controls, changes to certain manufacturing processes, and increased monitoring and reporting obligations. Similar foreign laws and regulations have been or may also be adopted to establish new standards for air emissions, which may also require best available control technology on our manufacturing operations outside the United States. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
International accords, foreign laws and regulations, and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations have been enacted to address concerns about the effects that CO2 emissions and other identified Green House Gases ("GHGs") may have on the environment and climate worldwide. These effects are widely referred to as climate change. The international community has taken actions to address climate change issues on a global basis. In particular, in December 2015, the 21st Conference of Parties for the UNFCC concluded with more than 190 countries adopting the Paris Agreement, which then came into force and was legally binding on the parties in November 2016. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature and consists of two elements: a legally binding commitment by each participating country to set an emissions reduction target, referred to as “nationally determined contributions” (“NDCs”), with a review of the NDCs that could lead to updates and enhancements every five years beginning in 2023, and a transparency commitment requiring participating countries to disclose in full their progress. Our activities in the European Union ("EU") are subject to the EU 

Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”), and it is likely that requirements relating to GHG emissions will become more stringent and will continue to expand to other jurisdictions in the future as NDCs under the Paris Agreement are implemented. After withdrawing from the Paris Agreement in 2019, the United States is now rejoining this global initiative. The EPA currently requires reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources and, in the future, the EPA or states may impose permitting obligations on new sources or existing sources that seek to modify their operations that would otherwise result in an increase in certain GHG emissions.
In the EU, the ETS, which was initially enacted under the provisions of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, requires certain listed energy-intensive industries to participate in an international “cap and trade” system of GHG emission allowances. A third phase of the EU ETS under Directive 2009/29/EC, covers the period 2013 to 2020 and instituted a number of program changes. EU Member States brought into force the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions to comply with this EU Directive. Carbon and graphite manufacturing is still not a covered industry sector in the revised Annex 1 of directive 2009/29/EC. However, one of our European manufacturing operations was required to comply with these provisions under a more general fuel combustion category, because its combustion units met the applicability levels. The operations subject to these provisions were eligible to receive free CO2 emission allowances under the member state allocation program. On November 9, 2017, to implement the EU’s NDC under the Paris Agreement and other GHG commitments, the European Parliament and Council announced a provisional agreement to revise and make more stringent the ETS during the Phase 4 period of 2021 to 2030. Among other changes, the Phase 4 provisions would further accelerate reduction in the current oversupply of allowances in the ETS market and establish further protections against the risks of carbon leakage. After extensive negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council formally supported the revision in February 2018. The revised EU ETS Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/410) entered into force on April 8, 2018. The EU’s current target for 2030 is to achieve a GHG reduction of at least 40% compared to 1990 levels. In addition, in December 2019, the European Commission presented the Communication on The European Green Deal announcing several upcoming legislative proposals for the EU 2050 climate neutrality objective and for increasing the EU 2030 GHG emissions reduction target to at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels. Implementation of Phase 4 could increase the cost of our current GHG allowances and require us to obtain additional allowances. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that compliance with international accords, U.S. and foreign laws and regulations concerning climate change which have been promulgated, or that could be promulgated in the future, including Phase 4 and any further GHG initiatives of the ETS, will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Some of our products (including our raw materials) are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of their component substances. For example, in connecting with the EU's REACH or the EU’s Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation, any key raw material, chemical or substance, including our products, could be classified as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, users of our products, or our employees. Coal tar pitch, which is classified as a substance of very high concern under REACH, is used in certain of our processes, but in a manner that we believe does not require us to obtain a specific authorization under the REACH guidelines. Similarly, the U.S. and other countries are currently enacting new or amending existing chemical control laws.
Estimates of future costs for compliance with U.S. and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, and for environmental liabilities, are necessarily imprecise due to numerous uncertainties, including the impact of potential new laws and regulations, the availability and application of new and diverse technologies, the extent of insurance coverage, the potential discovery of contaminated properties, or the identification of new hazardous substance disposal sites at which we may be a PRP and, in the case of sites subject to the Superfund Act and similar state and foreign laws, the final determination of remedial requirements and the ultimate allocation of costs among the PRPs. Subject to the inherent imprecision in estimating such future costs, but taking into consideration our experience to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known, we estimate that our costs and capital expenditures (in each case, before adjustment for inflation) for environmental protection regulatory compliance programs and for remedial response actions will not be material over the next several years. Furthermore, we establish accruals for environmental liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We adjust the accrual as new remedial actions or other commitments are made, as well as when new information becomes available that changes the prior estimates previously made and we believe our existing accruals are reasonable.
Data Privacy
We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions. This includes the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which enforces rules relating to the protection of processing and movement of personal data. The interpretation and enforcement of such regulations are continuously developing and evolving, and there may be uncertainty with respect to how to comply with them. 
Bribery
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits bribery of public officials to benefit business interests. We are also subject to similar anticorruption laws in other countries where we do business. We operate and sell our products in countries that are rated as high-risk for corruption, which creates the risk of unauthorized conduct by our employees, distributors, or other third-party intermediaries that could be in violation of the FCPA or similar local regulations. We comply with the FCPA’s requirements to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Import/Export Controls
We are subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business (whether directly or through resellers). In particular, our business activities must comply with U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department ("OFAC"). These regulations are complex and require extensive compliance efforts and expenditures. Furthermore, our compliance with these regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities and, from time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government agencies and regulators regarding our compliance. These controls, regulations, and restrictions have had, and we believe may continue to have, an impact on our business. 
Anticompetition Laws
We are subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate. In the U.S., this includes the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.
Securities Laws 
We must comply with a wide variety of federal and state securities laws and Delaware corporate law, as well as NYSE rules and regulations. We continue to engage in collaboration with key stakeholders to adapt to changing regulatory expectations. 
OSHA 
We are subject to a variety of regulations including work-related and community safety laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate. In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees and established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") in the Department of Labor.
Government regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether or our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,285 employees (excluding contractors), 809 of which were hourly employees. A total of 423 employees were in Europe (including Russia), 607 were in Mexico and Brazil, two were in South Africa, 247 were in the United States and six were in the Asia Pacific region.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 697 employees or 54%, of our worldwide employees, were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements that expire, or are subject to renegotiation, at various times through December 31, 2021. We believe that, in general, our relationships with our employees' unions are good and that we will be able to renew or extend our collective bargaining or similar agreements on reasonable terms as they expire. We have not had any material work stoppages or strikes during the past decade.
The health and safety of our global team is our highest priority and is a core value of the Company. Our comprehensive programs strive to achieve zero injuries and no harm done. Leading indicator metrics include training, risk identification and remediation, pre-task planning and planned job observations. Managers report weekly on their key contacts with employees to emphasize our shared commitment to Health, Safety & Environmental performance. In the spirit of 

continuous improvement, regular inspections, internal reviews and corporate audits are conducted to foster compliance with our high standards.
