ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History

On June 22, 2017, the Group filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma to change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.”, which became effective on June 29, 2017.
 
The Group, formerly known as 3DIcon Corporation, was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Prior to September 30, 2016, the Group’s primary activity had been the raising of capital in order to pursue its goal of becoming a significant participant in the development, commercialization and marketing of next generation 3D display technologies.
 
On September 30, 2016, Coretec Industries LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, and the Group issued an aggregate 15,870 shares of the Group’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which shares were subsequently converted into 30,374,363 shares of common stock.

Overview of the Company.
 
Coretec’s Technology. Coretec’s underlying technology is based on the production of a high value liquid silicon precursor, cyclohexasilane (“CHS”). A key advantage of CHS is that it remains in liquid form at room temperature and does not convert to a gas until heated above 450°F. CHS is a superior silicon precursor in many ways compared to materials commonly used for manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors and solar cells (monosilane or trichlorosilane) that have much lower boiling points which leads to higher cost handling and shipping. There are several technical advantages of using CHS versus common silicon precursors and one is that the production rate of the silicon-forming step can be increased by a factor of six, and relative to process temperature up to 10X or more, which leads to significant cost savings. We anticipate that CHS will first be used as an alternative to monosilane or trichlorosilane when adding silicon to lithium ion batteries or when used in manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors.
 
We also see longer term potential in several emerging markets where there are opportunities in the conversion of CHS into nanoparticles and nanowires for use in such emerging, high-growth markets as:
 

● | Energy storage 
--+---------------------------------
● | Solid state lighting 
● | Printable electronics 
● | Building-integrated solar energy

 
Enhancement of CSpace. A key challenge in the development of CSpace® is the development of the material used for the image chamber. The Company has explored a variety of glass alternatives. While progress has been made, it has been concluded that limitations remain, primarily in the weight and cost of a glass medium.
 
A key virtue of having our IP portfolio of silicon-based materials is that we use all of the manufacturing infrastructure and knowledge that is available for optical plastics for the CSpace® image chamber. The benefit to CSpace® is that silicon-based optical plastics can be molded into a broad range of shapes and allow the image chamber to be much lighter and much lower in cost than the glass material we worked with before.
 
Near-Term Revenue Opportunities. Opportunities for near-term revenue continue to be explored in battery and microelectronic markets. Interest in the use of silicon in Li-ion batteries continues to increase driven by the growing demand for electrical vehicles, the exploitation of mobile electronics, and energy storage systems for backup power and improved efficiency of home and commercial wind and solar systems. Discussions are ongoing with suppliers of Li-ion battery anode materials that are seeking next generation materials to further increase performance while improving lifetime, charging time, safety and reliability. We believe these suppliers will be well positioned to take advantage of the benefits provided by CHS when combined as a liquid with other solid-based materials. While we believe the use of CHS in Li-ion batteries will provide near term revenue, we also continue to explore revenue opportunities in microelectronics and especially those early adopter markets where advanced microelectronics are being developed in lower volumes and with less price sensitivity.

Cyclohexasilane Business
 
The Company’s business model is to identify and commercialize disruptive technologies in silicon serving advanced technology markets. Sources of disruptive technology are licensed technology created by major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Where technology does not already exist, research is to be sponsored and jointly developed with our customers. The initial candidates for commercialization center around CHS, and a source of this technology includes silicon technologies.
 
Coretec is developing, testing, and providing new and/or improved technologies and resulting product solutions for energy-related industries including, but not limited to oil/gas, renewable energy, energy conservation, and distributed energy industries. Many of these technologies and resulting product solutions also have application to the broader markets of anti-counterfeit packaging, medical devices, electronics, photonics, and displays. The initial technologies and product solutions are based on new innovations in cyclohexasilane (Si6H12), Si QDs, “stacked” polysilane ((R2Si)n), their alloys with various dopants, and in the future, high refractive index siloxane polymers (HRISP). Early adoption of these technologies and resulting product solutions is anticipated in markets for energy storage (Li-ion batteries), solid-state lighting (LEDs), solar energy (BIPV) and printable electronics (Asset Monitoring).
 
Coretec’s management leverages years of expertise and experience in equipment and services for the oil/gas industries, procuring and managing investments and financial services, and in R&D and commercialization of material and chemical technologies.
 
CHS Business Model
 
Coretec’s business model includes monitoring the ever-growing catalogue of new technologies and valuable IP for licensing opportunities that could lead to incremental improvements and/or additional features in resulting products or lead to next generation products for use by energy-related industries and is created and held within universities and other parties that may lack financial resources and/or interest to further develop and commercialize them.
 
Additionally, where needs exist, but new technologies and resulting products are not currently available, conduct research and development (“R&D”) activities through sponsored projects performed at major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Coretec will leverage existing, world-class expertise, experience, and laboratory facilities that reside in these non-profit, R&D entities for R&D, testing, and “proof of concept” studies up to and including at the device level that may be required to create commercialization opportunities.
 
Following these “proof of concept studies”, commercialization opportunities (e.g., manufacturing, marketing, sales) created for its technologies and IP will include, but are not limited to:
 

● | joint ventures or other business collaborations with Coretec’s joint development partners who can manufacture, market and sell new or improved products (based upon Coretec’s technologies and IP) into existing or new supply chains (that the partner company/companies already have an established, significant presence or can capture and grow market share); or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manufacturing, marketing and selling its own products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | creating “exit strategies” such as:
--+------------------------------------


o | sale of one or more technologies and IP to the private sector;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


o | license and/or sublicense one or more technologies and IP to the private sector; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | other business transactions, e.g., merger, acquisition, spinoffs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

CHS Research & Development
 
Coretec’s priorities for R&D and commercialization are customer/market-driven and guided by the needs and specifications of the energy-related industries served. Identified customer/market-driven opportunities include:
 

● | New and novel silicon-based materials that facilitate “greener” more eco-friendly energy production, including:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | lower cost, longer life, higher capacity battery energy storage systems, e.g., Li-ion batteries (LiBs), for use in transportation and distributed power generation systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | more aesthetically appealing, lower cost building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | flexible and/or printable electronics for use in monitoring the condition of distributed or remote assets, e.g., wind power and embedded, wireless sensors to detect corrosion and other changes in pipelines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New and novel silicon-based materials that facilitate “greener” more energy efficient products, including encapsulation of high brightness LEDs to improve light extraction and solar cells to improve full spectrum light collection;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New and novel silicon-based materials that facilitate more efficient and eco-friendly exploration and monitoring of distributed energy industries, including imaging materials for visualizing oil and gas exploration and distribution data using volumetric 3D displays; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New and novel silicon-based materials that prevent illegal imitation or reproduction of a product or service used within energy-related industries, including trusted supply (anti-counterfeit packaging) products for supply chain assurance, currency, identity documents, lottery tickets, etc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future CHS Revenue
 
In the future, we foresee revenue coming from one or more business transactions such as:
 

● | sale of Coretec’s novel silicon-based materials that improve or otherwise enhance performance of various products, e.g., Li-ion batteries, electronics, PV/solar cells, and displays and/or other optical-based devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a share of the revenue coming from the sale of jointly developed product(s) and/or from one or more joint ventures with strategic partners; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sale or licensing of technology/technologies and associated IP to joint development partners or other companies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
CHS Competition
 
Based on our market research and competitive analysis, we have concluded that our CHS technology is unique and provides an advantage in that it should allow 1) production at high yields at low cost using readily available raw materials, 2) storage, transport and use as a liquid at room temperature 3) processing of the liquid into fibers, particles, and films that when heated forms silicon, and 4) the simple addition of dopants to the liquid at an atomic level that when heated forms doped silicon. Competing silanes provided by numerous manufacturers exist as a gas at room temperature and are explosive resulting in greater cost during storage, handling, transportation and use. Our closest competitor is cyclopentasilane which exists as a gas at room temperature and has proven costly and difficult to manufacture. Other competitors exist in specific applications. For example, graphene and carbon nanotubes are potential competitors in printable electronics but are only now emerging and require purification that is proving costly. 
 
Coretec’s business and commercialization model is based in part upon establishing joint development partnerships with companies that are commercially successful and financially sound as well as deeply embedded in the supply chains for the aforementioned energy-related products. For example, Coretec is developing a strategic partnership with a domestic supplier of silicon-based materials that will facilitate further development and scale-up of Si6H12 plus chemical derivatives and other materials based on Si6H12. This strategic partnership will enable Coretec to supply large quantities of these novel silicon materials to those companies interested in producing prototype batteries, electronics, and PV/solar cells for testing and commercial evaluation. Coretec will continue to seek other such strategic partnerships within the private sector. 
 
Volumetric 3D Display Business
 
The Company owns the rights to a patented volumetric 3D display technology that was developed by and with the University of Oklahoma (the “University”) under a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”). The development to date has resulted in multiple technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2), and eight provisional patents; five of the eight provisional patents have been combined and converted to five utility patents. Under the SRA, the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies.
 
On May 26, 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") approved the patent called "Volumetric Liquid Crystal Display" for rendering a three-dimensional image and converted it to U.S. patent No. 7,537,345. On December 28, 2010, USPTO approved the patent called “Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe the foundation of what is called CSpace® technology (“CSpace”).

Overview of Volumetric 3D Display Technology 
 
Commercialization Strategy and Target Applications
 
The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through customer funded research and development contracts and technology licensing agreements for high value applications like air traffic control, design visualization, and medical imaging. The Company plans to develop products for contract engineering and with joint development customers. At this time the Company does not have any commercialized products and does not plan to develop its own products based on the CSpace technology due to the high value / low volume nature of the best-fit initial applications for this technology. These applications include but are not limited to the following:

● | Healthcare (diagnostics, surgical planning, training, telemedicine, bio surveillance);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyber security data visualization;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Military (operational planning, training, modeling and simulation, battlespace awareness, damage assessment, autonomous piloting);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physical security (passenger, luggage & cargo screening);
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Mining, oil & gas exploration; or
--+----------------------------------


● | Meteorological and oceanographic data visualization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 
CSpace Competition
 
Based on our market research and competitive analysis to date, we have concluded that the CSpace volumetric technology is unique and advantaged versus other 3D technologies in that it can deliver both 1) a true 360 degree viewing experience for multiple simultaneous users, and 2) high image quality, high reliability and large image size. Rear projection 3D displays such as those from Zecotek, Setred, and EuroLCDs (formerly LC Tech LightSpace) do not provide a 360-degree viewing experience and are typically limited to one or two users. Early proof of concept work done on infrared active phosphor displays by 3D Display Laboratories proved to not be scalable due to limited phosphor persistence and vector scanning limitations. While holographic and light field displays show promise, they do not deliver a true 360-degree viewing experience and cost-effective multiple user systems do not appear feasible due to current and expected pixel density, data bandwidth and compute power limitations.
 
History of 3D Technology Research and Development at the University of Oklahoma
 
Beginning in 2007 the University, under an SRA with the Company, undertook the development of high potential 3D display technologies. It is anticipated that Coretec’s technology will play a key role in the continued development of an image space material for CSpace.
