ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a consumer health care and beauty company that is in the process of building a portfolio of best-in-class consumer product brands. Our strategy is to grow both organically and by further acquisition.
Corporate History
 
We were organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 29, 2010 under the name “Oro Capital Corporation”. On April 7, 2014, an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) was entered into by and among us, Synergy Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of the transactions under the Merger Agreement (“Merger Sub”), and Synergy Strips Corp., a Delaware corporation incorporated on January 24, 2012 (“SSC”). The Merger Agreement provided for the merger of Merger Sub with and into SSC (the “Merger”), with SSC surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary. On April 17, 2014, we issued a share dividend to our shareholders in order to effect a 30-for-1 forward stock split. The Merger was consummated on April 21, 2014. On April 21, 2014, we changed our fiscal year end from July 31 to December 31. On April 28, 2014, we changed the name of the Company from “Oro Capital Corporation” to “Synergy Strips Corp.” On August 5, 2015, we changed the name to “Synergy CHC Corp.”
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries, Neuragen Corp., Sneaky Vaunt Corp., The Queen Pegasus Corp. and Breakthrough Products Inc., merged with and into the Company.

Products
 
Current Products
 



Development and Commercialization Strategy
 
We intend to expand on the current retail strategies and build out a strong online sales model.
 
Research and Development
 
We currently outsource our research and development to our manufacturers, as they are experienced in the development of new products and line extensions.
 
Manufacturing
 
We currently outsource the manufacturing of our products to third parties who have the necessary equipment and technology to provide mass quantities as required. FOCUSfactor is manufactured by Atrium Innovations and Vit-Best Nutrition. Flat Tummy Tea is manufactured by Caraway Tea Company. Neuragen is manufactured by C-Care. Hand MD is manufactured by HealthSpecialty. Sneaky Vaunt is manufactured by Dongguan Jingrui.
Commercialization
 
We are highly dependent on two retailers for the sale of our retail products: Costco Wholesale Corporation and Sam’s West, Inc./Walmart (a/k/a Sam’s Club), which comprise 78% of our net revenue for retail sales of our products. We intend to diversify our sales network and generate revenue by selling our consumer-ready products to retailers across North America, which retailers may then sell to end consumers through retail distribution channels. We also sell direct to wholesalers and distributors at a reduced cost as a means to grow our revenue base quickly and to penetrate the market more effectively.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we will rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights.
 
In December 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S. Patent 8,329,227 covering FOCUSfactor’s proprietary formulation “for enhanced mental function.” The issuance of the patent marked one of the few times a patent has been issued for a nationally branded nutritional supplement. The issuance of the patent for FOCUSfactor came after a 2011 clinical study report which showed that FOCUSfactor improved memory, concentration and focus in healthy adults participating in the study. The clinical study of FOCUSfactor was sponsored by Factor Nutrition Labs, the owner of the Focus Factor Business at the time, and was conducted by Cognitive Research Corporation, a full-service contract research organization that specializes in the effects of nutritional supplements and pharmaceutical products on human cognition. The study was conducted in compliance with all applicable country requirements for the conduct of clinical studies, including those outlined by the International Conference on Harmonization, Consolidated Guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, and the Food and Drug Administration.
 
In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop a competitive position in the market for our products. Each of these patents, patent applications, and know-how are integral to the conduct of our business, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Distribution and Marketing
 
We plan to focus on selling to retailers and distributors who currently are active in the consumer product space with the aim to expedite the penetration of market acceptance of the product. We are currently conducting research with focus groups to find out what the best approach for marketing efforts is and how to do so in the most cost-effective manner. We also plan to develop an online sales channel.
Markets
 
We sell our products in mostly North American retail locations along with other developed countries with similar retail landscapes to North America.
 
Competition
 
Although there are many competing products on the market, in all our current product categories, FOCUSfactor is the only product in its category with both a patent and clinical study to support its claims. FOCUSfactor’s competitors include a wide range of products, from targeted brain-enhancement supplements to indirect competitors such as energy drinks that claim to improve concentration.
Government Regulation
 
The products that we sell, and those that we are developing for future sale, may be subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval for packaging compliance. With respect to the products we currently sell, our regulatory counsel has reviewed all of our products and we believe we are compliant with the current rules. Since the current products sold are considered nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals and over the counter products, minimal regulations are placed on the product with the exception of the appropriate labeling and warnings on the packaging.
 
We will rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as local counsel, to guide our compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we do business.

We do not anticipate, at this time, that the cost of compliance with U.S. and foreign laws will have a material financial impact on operations, business or financial condition. There are, however, no guarantees that new regulatory and tariff legislation will not have a material negative effect on our business in the future.
 
Employees
 
As of April 13, 2020, we had 36 full-time employees. We intend to grow our employee base in response to the demands and requirements of the business. We believe that the employer-employee relationships in our Company are positive. We have no labor union contracts.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The recent outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemic poses the risk that the Company or its employees, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company’s business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected and in which the Company operates could disrupt the operation of the Company’s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures may also have an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company may take temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring all employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company’s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company’s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.
