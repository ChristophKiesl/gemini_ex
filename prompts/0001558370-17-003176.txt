 Our Strategic Initiatives
     In fiscal 2015, we launched a transformational strategy designed to improve the performance of our business segments and strengthen our shared service capabilities. This strategy drives our decisions on where we will operate and how we will achieve our goals in markets around the world. The overall design of our business and organizational plan is intended to create sustainable and profitable growth and improve organizational capability. This strategy encompasses the following initiatives:
     Invest in our core businesses
 We have developed a portfolio of brands that are market leaders or have a path to grow their market position in attractive categories. We continue to invest behind our most productive brands, which represented approximately 60% of net sales revenue in fiscal 2017. We believe that strategic investment in new products, go-to-market plans and marketing activities will continue to accelerate the organic growth of these brands. 
     Strategic, disciplined mergers and acquisitions
 We are continually looking for new businesses and opportunities to expand in categories and geographies where we believe we have critical mass and can develop or sustain a competitive advantage. We will also increase our brand reach through new licensing opportunities when and where it makes sense. We frequently assess our portfolio of products and businesses to ensure each has a role to support our long-term plans.
     Invest in consumer-centric innovation
 We have a long history of developing or acquiring new technologies, new products that improve consumers’ lives and new designs to differentiate our products from competitors. We continue to focus on innovation, both in our core categories and product adjacencies. We also focus on initiatives that create commercial value for existing products in order to increase their appeal and accelerate their organic growth. Consumer shopper preferences and behaviors have transformed the retail landscape from in-store to omni-channel purchasing experiences. As the retail consumer evolves, we continue to upgrade our digital talent and capabilities and operational capacity to thrive no matter how consumers choose to buy.
     Upgrade our organization and people systems
 We believe our employees are our most valuable assets. Attracting, retaining and developing talent is a key focus of our company to ensure we can continue to deliver strong business results. 
     Best in class shared services
 We have developed a quality, diversified base of suppliers in North America and China. Through our shared service structure, we strive to improve our existing supplier base and infrastructure, develop new manufacturing partners, leverage scale, reduce lead times and apply best practices to ensure our products are innovative, on time, on cost and on quality. We also continue to invest in our distribution center capabilities and information technology systems while
 applying discipline and best practices to leverage scale and achieve supply chain excellence. We use a similar approach across all our shared service functions.
     Attack waste
 We continue to adopt more efficient and effective approaches to managing people, teams and projects to best respond to today’s complex business environment. We believe that combining the best people and practices with the right technology provides a foundation for stable growth. We promote a culture of attacking waste to improve the quality of our products and services, reduce costs and enhance our capacity to handle increased volume in order to exceed the expectations of our customers and consumers. 
     Asset efficiency and shareholder friendly policies
 As we manage our businesses for long-term growth and success in the marketplace, we are also looking to manage our overall base of assets and capital structure to increase shareholder value. We focus on maximizing cash flow, controlling our costs, return on investment, increasing the efficiency of the capital we deploy, and optimizing working capital. We also seek to invest in accretive and strategic acquisitions and, where appropriate, provide a return of capital to shareholders.

      Our Trademarks
 We sell certain of our products under trademarks licensed from third parties. We also market products under a number of trademarks that we own. We believe our principal trademarks, both owned and licensed, have high levels of brand name recognition among retailers and consumers throughout the world. Through our favorable association with our licensors, we believe we have developed stable, enduring relationships that provide access to unique brands that complement our owned and internally developed trademarks. 
     The Beauty and Health & Home segments depend upon the continued use of trademarks licensed under various agreements for a substantial portion of their net sales revenue. New product introductions under licensed trademarks require approval from the respective licensors. The licensors must also approve the product packaging. Many of our license agreements require us to pay minimum royalties, meet minimum sales volumes and some require us to make minimum levels of advertising expenditures.

      Patents and Other Intellectual Property
 We maintain utility and design patents in the United States and several foreign countries. We also protect certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.     Sales and Marketing
 We currently market our products in approximately 75 countries throughout the world. Sales within the United States comprised approximately 81%, 80% and 79% of total net sales revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our segments primarily sell their products through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, home improvement stores, catalogs, grocery stores, specialty stores, beauty supply retailers, e-commerce retailers, wholesalers, and various types of distributors, as well as directly to consumers. We collaborate extensively with our retail customers and, in many instances, produce specific versions of our product lines with exclusive designs and packaging for their stores, which are appropriately priced for their respective customer bases. We market products principally through the use of outside sales representatives and our own internal sales staff, supported by our internal marketing, category management, engineering, creative services, and customer and consumer service staff. These groups work closely together to develop pricing and distribution strategies, to design packaging and to help develop product line extensions and new products.
     The Nutritional Supplements segment sells directly to consumers through highly targeted catalog and other printed collateral mailings, online and direct response print, radio and television media. The segment also sells over the telephone through customer call centers. The segment maintains exclusive development and marketing relationships with several medical and wellness professionals, who provide research and advocacy for Company products and are key components of its marketing and customer outreach programs. The Nutritional Supplements segment does not have any material formal relationships with any re-distributors, nor does it maintain any field sales force outside of its call centers.
     Research and Development
 Our research and development activities focus on new, differentiated and innovative products designed to drive sustained organic growth. We continually invest to strengthen our product design and research and development capabilities, including extensive study to gain consumer insight. Information regarding our research and development costs for each of the past three fiscal years is included in Note 1 to consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

 Manufacturing and Distribution
 We contract with unaffiliated manufacturers, primarily in China and Mexico, to manufacture a significant portion of our finished goods for the Beauty appliances and accessories, Housewares, Healthcare, Water Filtration, and Home Environment product categories. The Nutritional Supplements segment and the North American region of the grooming, skin and hair care category of the Beauty segment source most of their products from U.S. manufacturers. For fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, finished goods manufactured by vendors in the Far East comprised approximately 67%, 68% and 67%, respectively, of total finished goods purchased.
     In total, we occupy approximately 3,480,000 square feet of distribution space in various locations to support our operations, which includes a 1,200,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, and a 1,300,000 square foot distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi, used to support a significant portion of our domestic distribution. We ship Housewares, Nutritional Supplements and Beauty grooming, skin care and hair care solutions products out of the Southaven facility. We ship Health & Home and Beauty segment appliance products out of the Olive Branch facility. 
     Customers
 Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (including its worldwide affiliates) accounted for approximately 15%, 16% and 18% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales revenue during those fiscal years. Sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 43%, 40% and 41% percent of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Order Backlog 
 When placing orders, our individual consumer, retail and wholesale customers usually request that we ship the related products within a short time frame. As such, there usually is no significant backlog of orders in any of our distribution channels.     Seasonality
 SEASONALITY AS A PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL NET SALES REVENUE

 | Fiscal Years Ended | 
 | the Last Day of February, | 
Fiscal Quarter Ended | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | 
May | | 22.6 | % | 22.3 | % | 21.6 | %
August | | 24.0 | % | 23.9 | % | 22.1 | %
November | | 28.9 | % | 28.8 | % | 30.2 | %
February | | 24.5 | % | 25.0 | % | 26.1 | %

      The overall sales pattern for our Nutritional Supplements segment is not highly seasonal. Our other segments are seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns. Historically, the third fiscal quarter produces the highest net sales revenue during the fiscal year. 
     Competitive Conditions
 We sell our products in markets that are very competitive and mature. Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. We believe that we have certain key competitive advantages, such as well recognized brands, engineering expertise and innovation, sourcing and supply chain know-how, and productive co-development relationships with our Far East manufacturers. We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing activities, as well as an extensive sales force in order to build awareness and to encourage new consumers to try our brands and products.  We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. We believe these advantages allow us to bring our retailers a value proposition in our products that can significantly out-perform private label products in most categories.

 We believe the market for the Nutritional Supplements segment is growing, but highly fragmented. Competition includes multi-level marketers, internet sites, specialty and mass retailers, pharmacy, grocery, and membership clubs. The primary competitive factors across these channels are pricing, perceived value and efficacy of ingredients, supporting clinical research, product claims, ease of ordering, customer service, and cost of delivery. 
     The following table summarizes our primary competitors by business segment:
    
Segment | Competitor 
Housewares | Lifetime Brands, Inc. (KitchenAid), Newell Brands Inc., Simple Human LLC, Newell Brands Inc. (Contigo), Yeti Holdings, Inc. (Yeti), Can’t Live Without It, Inc. (S’well)
Health & Home | Exergen Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Crane Engineering, Newell Brands, Lasko Products, LLC., The Clorox Company (Brita), Zero Technologies, LLC. 
Nutritional Supplements | Mercola.com, Life Extension, Swanson Health Products 
Beauty | Conair, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (Remington), Newell Brands Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever N.V., Colgate-Palmolive Company 

      Governmental,  Regulatory and Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions’ environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.  Many of the products we sell are subject to a number of product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. These laws and regulations specify the maximum allowable levels of certain materials that may be contained in our products, provide statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, specify product safety testing requirements, and set product identification and labeling requirements.
     The Nutritional Supplements segment operates almost entirely in the United States. Importing, manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling, and advertising of our Nutritional Supplements segment products may be subject to regulation by one or more federal or state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) rules impose requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of dietary supplement products. For example, it requires that companies establish extensive written procedures and controls governing various areas and requires identity testing of all incoming ingredients unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. FDA prescribed good manufacturing practices are designed to ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled to reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the FDA share jurisdiction over the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies, the FDA has primary jurisdiction over claims that appear on product labels and labeling and the FTC has primary jurisdiction over product advertising.
     Additionally, an emerging trend with both governments and our retail customers is to prescribe public and private social accountability reporting requirements regarding our worldwide business activities. In our product space, some requirements have already been mandated and we believe others may become required. Examples of current requirements include conflict minerals content reporting and reporting of foreign fair labor practices in connection with our supply chain vendors. 
     We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and other reporting requirements. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition, nor do we expect it to do so in the foreseeable future. Due to the nature of our

operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance and social reporting standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other reporting mandates.
     Employees
 As of February 28, 2017, we employed approximately 1,685 full-time employees worldwide. We also use temporary, part-time and seasonal employees as needed. None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain of our employees in Europe are covered by collective arrangements in accordance with local practice. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our employees.  Available Information
