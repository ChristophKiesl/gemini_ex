Item 1. Business
Background
 CACI International Inc (CACI), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company whose operations are conducted through subsidiaries that are located in the United States (U.S.) and Europe.  CACI was founded in 1962 as a simulation technology company and has grown into a leading provider of Expertise and Technology to Enterprise and Mission customers, on both a domestic and international basis.  
Our proven Expertise and Technology and strong record of program delivery have enabled us to compete for and secure new customers and new contracts, win repeat business, and build and maintain long-term customer relationships. We seek competitive business opportunities and have built our operations to support major programs through a market-focused business development organization.
 Our primary customers are agencies and departments of the U.S. government. Our Expertise and Technology support national security missions and government modernization/transformation for intelligence, defense, and federal civilian customers.  The demand for our Expertise and Technology, in large measure, is created by the increasingly complex network, systems, and information environments in which governments and businesses operate, the global geo-political conditions impacting national security, and by the need to stay current with emerging technology while increasing productivity, enhancing security, and, ultimately, improving performance.
 Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we”, “our”, “the Company” and “CACI” as used in Parts I, II and III include CACI International Inc and its subsidiaries and ventures that are majority-owned or otherwise controlled by it. The term “the Registrant” as used in Parts I, II and III refers to CACI International Inc only.

International Operations
 Our international operations are conducted primarily through our operating subsidiaries in Europe, CACI Limited and CACI BV, and account for substantially all revenue generated from international customers.  Headquartered in London, our international operations provide a diverse mix of IT services and proprietary data and software products, serving commercial and government customers throughout the U.K., continental Europe and around the world.  
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive industry that includes many firms, some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than we do. We obtain much of our business on the basis of proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current customers, who may also receive proposals from other firms. Non-traditional players have entered the market and have established positions related to such areas as cloud computing, cyber, satellite operations, and business systems. Additionally, we face indirect competition from certain government agencies that perform services for themselves similar to those marketed by us. We know of no single competitor that is dominant in our fields of technology. We have a relatively small share of the addressable market for our solutions and services and intend to achieve growth and increase market share both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
Strengths and Strategy
 We primarily offer our entire range of expertise and technology to defense, intelligence and civilian agencies of the U.S. government. Our work for U.S. government agencies may combine a wide range of skills drawn from our expertise and technology. We also contract through our international operations to provide our offerings to governments of other nations. As with other government contractors, our business is subject to government customer funding decisions and actions that are beyond our control.
 Our international commercial customer base consists primarily of large commercial and government enterprises in the U.K.  This market is the primary target of a diverse mix of IT consultancy services and proprietary data and software products. Commercial bids are frequently negotiated as to terms and conditions for schedule, specifications, delivery and payment.

In order to effectively perform on our existing customer contracts and secure new customer contracts within the U.S. government, we must maintain expert knowledge of agency policies, operations and challenges. We combine this comprehensive knowledge with expertise and technology for our Enterprise and Mission customers. Our capabilities provide us with opportunities either to compete directly for, or to support other bidders in competition for multi-million dollar and multi-year award contracts from the U.S. government.
 We have strategic business relationships with a number of companies associated with the information technology industry. These strategic partners have business objectives compatible with ours and offer products and services that complement ours. We intend to continue development of these kinds of relationships wherever they support our growth objectives.
 Our marketing and new business development is conducted by many of our officers and managers including the Chief Executive Officer, executive officers, vice presidents and division managers. We employ marketing professionals who identify and qualify major contract opportunities, primarily in the federal government market.
 Much of our business is won through submission of formal competitive bids. Government and commercial customers typically base their decisions regarding contract awards on their assessment of the quality of past performance, responsiveness to proposal requirements, price, and other factors. The terms, conditions and form of contract of government bids, however, are in most cases specified by the customer. In situations in which the customer-imposed contract type and/or terms appear to expose us to inappropriate risk or do not offer us a sufficient financial return, we may seek alternate arrangements or opt not to bid for the work. Essentially all contracts with the U.S. government, and many contracts with other government entities, permit the government customer to terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government or for default by the contractor. Although we operate under the risk that such terminations may occur and have a material impact on operations, such terminations have been rare and, generally, have not materially affected operations.
 Our contracts and subcontracts are composed of a wide range of contract types, including firm fixed-price, cost reimbursement, time-and-materials, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and government wide acquisition contracts (known as GWACS) such as General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts. By company policy, significant fixed-price contracts require the approval of at least two of our senior officers.
 In FY2021, the top ten revenue-producing contracts, many of which consist of many task orders, accounted for 33.8 percent of our revenue, or $2.0 billion.
 Recent Acquisitions
 During the past three fiscal years, we completed a total of nine acquisitions, including:
  
• | On August 11, 2020, CACI completed the acquisition of Ascent Vision Technologies (AVT). AVT specializes in Electro-Optical Infrared payloads, On-Board Computer Vision Processing and counter-unmanned aircraft system (C-UAS) solutions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | During the second quarter of FY2020, CACI completed three strategic acquisitions adding key capabilities in mission expertise and technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On June 1, 2019 CACI Limited acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Mood Enterprises Limited, a United Kingdom company that provides software and managed services to defense, national security and commercial organizations.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seasonal Nature of Business
 Our business in general is not seasonal, although the summer and holiday seasons affect our revenue because of the impact of holidays and vacations on our labor and on product and service sales by our international operations. Variations in our business also may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new business is obtained.

The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of a fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended funds. Moreover, in years when the U.S. government does not complete the budget process for the next fiscal year before the end of September, government operations whose appropriations legislation has not been signed into law are funded under a continuing resolution that authorizes them to continue to operate but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives.
 Human Capital
 Our People
 Our employees are our most valuable resource. We are in continuing competition for highly skilled professionals in virtually all of our market areas. The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain high quality people at all levels of the organization. As of June 30, 2021, we employed approximately 22,000 talented full and part-time employees that help make CACI a respected and recognized industry leader with 36% of our employees holding degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics fields, 25% holding advanced degrees, and 75% of our employees holding security clearances.
Our Culture
 Our culture defines who we are, how we act, and what we believe is the right way to conduct business and is the driving force behind our success. Our culture unifies us as a company and strengthens our resolve to meet our customers’ – and our country’s – most critical missions.
 We believe that there are two pillars to our culture: Character and Innovation. Character is demonstrated in our commitment to ethics and integrity as we expect all of our employees and independent contractors to comply with our high standards for the conduct of our business that are reflected in our policies and practices. We require all of our employees, independent contractors working on customer engagements, officers, and directors annually to execute and affirm to the code of ethics applicable to their activities. In addition, we require annual ethics and compliance training for all of our employees to provide them with the knowledge necessary to maintain our high standards of ethics and compliance.
 Innovation is demonstrated in our dedication to advancement and excellence.  Our Center for Research, Application, Development, Learning, and Engagement (CRADLE℠) is a state-of-the-art collaboration facility that provides customers with an enhanced engagement experience, built to foster innovation, creative designs, and unique solutions. The CRADLE brings together customers, industry partners, academia, and CACI personnel to explore and discover new ways to solve complex problems and challenges.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 We embrace diversity and inclusion as core values and seek to ensure that all our employees experience a highly inclusive working environment.  CACI’s diversity and inclusion efforts are guided by a Diversity and Inclusion Working Group that includes a cross-section of diverse employees and senior executive leaders who have created a foundation and strategy for embracing diversity. This Group meets with our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) to set strategy, seek input, create advocacy, and ensure alignment with CACI’s business strategy.  Across our total employee population 31% are female; 33% are ethnically diverse; and 37% are military veterans.
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
 Our industry is ever-evolving, and those who are most successful evolve with it, continually learning and growing throughout their careers. To ensure we have the talent to meet the needs of our customers, we employ broad recruiting and outreach efforts, including partnerships with universities, the military, and professional organizations, resulting in an inclusive pool of the most qualified candidates. 
 We are able to retain our employees through our career mobility corporate culture, where we believe in growth at all levels. We encourage all employees to embrace a career growth mindset at CACI and strive to provide our employees with long-term professional advancement and a great workplace experience through professional development and a culture of mobility because our people drive our company.

CACI has conducted employee engagement surveys and we rank above external benchmark companies in the areas of sustainable engagement, customer focus, inclusion, innovation, teamwork and empowerment. Specifically, our employees report that they have a personal sense of accomplishment in their work, they feel safe to speak up, and they have pride in CACI. These indicators of an exceptionally strong culture and work environment puts CACI in an extremely competitive position to attract and retain talent and reach our organizational growth objectives. We continue to invest in the areas that produce such high engagement – leadership education, career resources for employees, comprehensive onboarding for new employees, and formal and informal communications that create a two-way dialogue among employees and leaders. 
 Employee Safety and Health
 Our primary focus is the health and safety of our employees and customers.  By ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers, we are doing our part to contribute to the ongoing health in communities where we operate.
 We have formed a multi-functional working group to monitor and respond to COVID-19.  As travel restrictions, social distancing advisories, and other requirements began to be implemented in March 2020, we instructed our workforce to begin to work remotely to the extent possible. While a majority of our workforce is able to work remotely, some employees must still travel to client or company facilities in order to work. While CACI employees were deemed part of the ‘critical infrastructure workforce’, ensuring their ability to work despite state travel limitations, our business still experienced some impacts as a result of COVID-19 risk mitigation efforts. For example, in order to reduce personnel concentration and ensure social distancing in classified environments, shift work was implemented, which reduced the number of hours our employees could work and we could bill customers on certain programs. 
 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was passed by Congress and signed by the President on March 27, 2020, provided a mechanism to bill hours where our employees are ready and able to work but unable to access required facilities due to COVID-19. This support was subsequently extended through September 30, 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021. We continue to work with our customers to implement the related provisions of the CARES Act, as well as appropriate risk mitigation efforts and alternative work arrangements.
 Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses
 Generally, our solutions and services are not substantially dependent upon obtaining or maintaining intellectual property protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. The Company owns patents and claims copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. We also maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets protection adequate to ensure their continuing availability to us.
 Our proprietary information is protected through a combination of contractual arrangements with our employees and third parties and intellectual property laws. From time to time, we are required to assert our rights against former employees or other third parties who attempt to misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information. Although we are not materially dependent on the protection of our intellectual property, we take such matters seriously and pursue claims against such individuals to the extent necessary to adequately protect our rights.
 As a systems integrator, it is important that we maintain access to software, data and other products supplied by third parties and we continue to enter into agreements that give us the right to distribute and receive income from third party software, data and other products that serve our customers. The durations of such agreements are negotiated and vary according to the terms of the agreements.
