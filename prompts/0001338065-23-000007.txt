Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
DCP Midstream, LP (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “us,” the “registrant,” or the “Partnership”) is a Delaware limited Partnership formed in 2005 by DCP Midstream, LLC to own, operate, acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets. DCP Midstream, LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively referred to as DCP Midstream, LLC is a joint venture between Phillips 66 and Enbridge, Inc. (“Enbridge”) that, prior to the realignment transaction in August of 2022 described below, was owned 50% by Phillips 66 and 50% by Enbridge.
Our operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i) Logistics and Marketing and (ii) Gathering and Processing. Our Logistics and Marketing segment includes transporting, trading, marketing, and storing natural gas and NGLs, and fractionating NGLs. Our Gathering and Processing segment consists of gathering, compressing, treating, and processing natural gas, producing and fractionating NGLs, and recovering condensate. The remainder of our business operations are presented as “Other,” and consist of unallocated corporate costs.
Realignment Transaction
On August 17, 2022, Phillips 66 and Enbridge, through their respective subsidiaries, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger for the purpose of realigning their respective economic and governance interests in the Partnership and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC through the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC with another joint venture owned by Phillips 66 and Enbridge (the “Realignment Transaction”). In connection with the closing of the Realignment Transaction, Phillips Gas Company LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 (“PGC”), and Spectra DEFS Holding, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Enbridge, as the members of DCP Midstream, LLC, entered into a Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of DCP Midstream, LLC (the “Third A&R LLC Agreement”), which, among other things, designated PGC as the Class A Managing Member of DCP Midstream, LLC with the power to conduct, direct and manage all activities of DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the Partnership and each of its subsidiaries, DCP Midstream GP, LP (“GP LP”), our general partner, and DCP Midstream GP, LLC, the general partner of GP LP (the “General Partner”), and, in each case, the businesses, activities and liabilities thereof. The Third A&R LLC Agreement also provided PGC with the power to exercise DCP Midstream, LLC’s rights to appoint or remove any director on the board of directors of our General Partner and vote the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership that are owned directly or indirectly by DCP Midstream, LLC.
The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2022.
Pending Merger with Phillips 66 
On August 17, 2022, the board of directors of our General Partner received a non-binding proposal from Phillips 66 to acquire all of the Partnership’s issued and outstanding publicly-held common units not already owned by DCP Midstream, LLC or its subsidiaries at a value of $34.75 per common unit (the “Proposal”). The board of directors of our General Partner appointed the special committee to review, evaluate and negotiate the Proposal. 
 On January 5, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Phillips 66, Phillips 66 Project Development Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 (“PDI”), Dynamo Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDI (“Merger Sub”), GP LP and our General Partner, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as a Delaware limited partnership (the “Merger”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each common unit representing a limited partner interest in the Partnership (other than the common units owned by DCP Midstream, LLC and GP LP) will be converted into the right to receive $41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. The Partnership’s Preferred Units will be unaffected by the Merger and will remain outstanding following the Merger.
The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, were unanimously approved on behalf of the Partnership by the special committee and the board of directors of our General Partner, which is the general partner of GP LP. The special committee, which is comprised of independent members of the board of directors of our general partner, retained independent legal and financial advisors to assist it in evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, DCP Midstream, LLC and GP LP, which, together own greater than a majority of the common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership, delivered a written consent to GP LP that was sufficient to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. Completion of the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated on the terms described above or at all.
OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our primary business objectives are to achieve sustained company profitability, a strong balance sheet and profitable growth. We intend to accomplish these objectives by prudently executing the following business strategies:
Operational Performance. We believe our operating efficiency and reliability enhance our ability to attract new natural gas supplies by enabling us to offer more competitive terms, services and service flexibility to producers. Our logistics assets and gathering and processing systems consist of high-quality, well-maintained facilities, resulting in low-cost, efficient operations. Our goal is to establish a reputation in the midstream industry as a reliable, safe and low cost supplier of services to our customers. We will continue to pursue incremental revenue, cost efficiencies and operating improvements of our assets through process and technology improvements. We seek to increase the utilization of our existing facilities by providing additional services to our existing customers, by establishing relationships with new customers and by strategically rationalizing assets. In addition, we maximize efficiency by coordinating the completion of new facilities in a manner that is consistent with the expected production that supports them. 
Organic Growth. We intend to use our strategic asset base in the United States and our position as one of the largest processors of natural gas, and as one of the largest producers and marketers of NGLs in the United States, as a platform for future growth. We plan to grow our business by leveraging our diverse and strategic asset base to increase supply across our fully integrated value chain. We will also make selective and capital efficient investments in our assets and energy transition.
Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships. We intend to pursue economically attractive and strategic acquisition and partnership opportunities within the midstream energy industry, both in new and existing lines of business, and areas of operation.
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
We are one of the largest processors of natural gas and one of the largest producers and marketers of NGLs in the United States with a diversified portfolio of integrated assets across our value chain. In 2022, our total wellhead volume was approximately 4.4 Bcf/d of natural gas and we produced an average of approximately 421 MBbls/d of NGLs. We provide natural gas gathering services to the wellhead, and leverage our strategic footprint to extend the value chain through our integrated NGL and natural gas pipelines and marketing infrastructure. We believe our ability to provide all of these services gives us an advantage in competing for new supplies of natural gas because we can provide substantially all services to move natural gas and NGLs from wellhead to market, and creates value for our customers. We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies and achieve one of our primary business objectives of sustaining our cash distribution per unit because of the following competitive strengths:
Integrated Logistics and Marketing Operations. We believe the strategic location of our assets coupled with their geographic diversity and our reputation for running our business reliably and effectively, presents us with continuing opportunities to provide competitive services to our customers and attract new natural gas production to our gathering and processing operations. We have connected our gathering and processing operations to key markets with NGL pipelines that we own or operate to offer our customers a competitive, integrated midstream service. We have strategically located NGL transportation pipelines that provide takeaway capabilities for our gathering and processing operations in the Permian Basin, the Denver-Julesburg Basin (“DJ Basin”), the Midcontinent, East Texas, the Gulf Coast, South Texas, and Central Texas. Our NGL pipelines connect to various natural gas processing plants and transport the NGLs to fractionation facilities, a petrochemical plant, a third party underground NGL storage facility and other markets along the Gulf Coast. Our Logistics and Marketing operations also consists of multiple downstream assets including NGL fractionation facilities, an NGL storage facility and a residue gas storage facility.
Strategically Located Gas Gathering and Processing Operations.  Our assets are strategically located in areas with the potential for increasing our wellhead volumes and cash flow generation. We have operations in some of the largest producing regions in the United States including the DJ Basin, Midcontinent, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford. In addition, we operate one of the largest portfolios of natural gas processing plants in the United States. Our gathering systems and processing plants are connected to numerous key natural gas pipeline systems that provide producers with access to a variety of natural gas market hubs.
Stable Cash Flows. Our operations consist of a mix of fee-based and commodity-based services, which together with our commodity hedging program, are intended to generate relatively stable cash flows. The long term growth in our fee-based earnings will reduce the impact of unhedged margins. Additionally, while certain of our gathering and processing contracts 
subject us to commodity price risk, we have mitigated a portion of our currently anticipated commodity price risk associated with the equity volumes from our gathering and processing operations with fixed price commodity swaps. As of December 31, 2022, we were approximately 70% fee-based.
Established Relationships with Oil, Natural Gas and Petrochemical Companies. We have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers and customers, and we expect that we will continue to benefit from these relationships.
Digital Transformation. We are driving workforce efficiencies through automation, improving safety and decreasing emissions via real-time monitoring and predictive analytics and optimizing margins while increasing cost efficiencies. 
Experienced Management Team. Our senior management team and the board of directors of our General Partner have extensive experience in the midstream industry.
Affiliation with DCP Midstream, LLC and Phillips 66. Our relationship with DCP Midstream, LLC and its Class A Managing Member, Phillips 66, should continue to provide us with significant business opportunities. Through our relationship with DCP Midstream, LLC and Phillips 66, we believe our strong commercial relationships throughout the energy industry, including with major producers of natural gas and NGLs in the United States, will help facilitate the implementation of our strategies.
DCP Midstream, LLC has a significant interest in us through its ownership, together with GP LP, of approximately 57% of our common units. Through its ownership interest in DCP Midstream, LLC, Phillips 66 holds an indirect economic interest in us of approximately 43%, and is responsible, as the Class A Managing Member of DCP Midstream, LLC, for conducting, directing and managing all activities associated with us, our subsidiaries, GP LP and our General Partner.
OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS 
Logistics and Marketing Segment
General
We market our NGLs, residue gas and condensate and provide logistics and marketing services to third-party NGL producers and sales customers in significant NGL production and market centers in the United States. This includes purchasing NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL producers for shipment on our NGL pipelines and resale in key markets. 
Our NGL services include plant tailgate purchases, transportation, fractionation, flexible pricing options and price risk management. Our primary NGL operations are located in close proximity to our Gathering and Processing assets in each of the operating regions. 
Our NGL pipelines transport NGLs from natural gas processing plants to fractionation facilities, petrochemical plants and a third party underground NGL storage facility. Our pipelines provide transportation services to customers primarily on a fee basis. Therefore, the results of operations for this business are generally dependent upon the volume of product transported and the level of fees charged to customers. The volumes of NGLs transported on our pipelines are dependent on the level of production of NGLs from processing plants connected to our NGL pipelines. When natural gas prices are high relative to NGL prices, it is less profitable to recover NGLs from natural gas because of the higher value of natural gas compared to the value of NGLs. As a result, we have experienced periods, and will likely experience periods in the future, when higher relative natural gas prices reduce the volume of NGLs produced at plants connected to our NGL pipelines.
Our natural gas systems have the ability to deliver gas into numerous downstream transportation pipelines and markets. We sell residue gas on behalf of our producer customers and residue gas which we earn under our gas supply agreements, supplying the residue gas demands of end-use customers physically attached to our pipeline systems and managing excess capacity of our owned storage and transportation assets. End-users include large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities. We are focused on extracting the highest possible value for the residue gas that results from our processing and transportation operations. We sell the residue gas at market-based prices.

NGL Pipelines
DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC, or the Sand Hills pipeline, an interstate NGL pipeline which is owned 66.67% by us and 33.33% by Phillips 66, is a common carrier pipeline that provides takeaway service from plants in the Permian and the Eagle Ford basins to fractionation facilities along the Texas Gulf Coast and at the Mont Belvieu, Texas market hub.
DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC, or the Southern Hills pipeline, an interstate NGL pipeline which is owned 66.67% by us and 33.33% by Phillips 66, provides takeaway service from the North and Midcontinent regions to fractionation facilities at the Mont Belvieu, Texas market hub.
Front Range Pipeline LLC, or the Front Range pipeline, an interstate NGL pipeline in which we own a 33.33% interest, originates in the DJ Basin and extends to Skellytown, Texas. The Front Range pipeline connects to our O'Connor plants, Lucerne 1, Lucerne 2, and Mewbourn plants, as well as third party plants in the DJ Basin. Enterprise Products Partners L.P., or Enterprise, is the operator of the pipeline. 
Texas Express Pipeline LLC, or the Texas Express pipeline, an intrastate NGL pipeline in which we own a 10% interest, originates near Skellytown in Carson County, Texas, and extends to Enterprise's natural gas liquids fractionation and storage 
complex at Mont Belvieu, Texas. The pipeline also provides access to other third party facilities in the area. Enterprise is the operator of the pipeline. 
The Southern Hills, Texas Express, and Front Range pipelines have in place long-term, fee-based transportation agreements, a portion of which are ship-or-pay, with us as well as third party shippers. These NGL pipelines collect fee-based transportation revenue under regulated tariffs.
Natural Gas Pipelines
Gulf Coast Express LLC, or the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, an intrastate natural gas pipeline in which we own a 25% interest, originates from the Waha area in West Texas to Agua Dulce, in Nueces County, Texas. Kinder Morgan is the operator of the pipeline. The Gulf Coast Express pipeline is fully subscribed under long-term transportation contracts with us and third party shippers.
The Guadalupe pipeline is an intrastate natural gas pipeline that provides us access to market centers/hubs including Waha, Texas, Katy, Texas and the Houston Ship Channel and is used primarily in our natural gas asset based trading activities. We may transport volumes for third party shippers using our available capacity in the future.
Cheyenne Connector, LLC, or the Cheyenne Connector is an interstate natural gas pipeline in which we own a 50% interest, which provides residue gas takeaway from the DJ Basin to the Rockies Express Cheyenne Hub, just south of the Colorado-Wyoming border. Tallgrass Energy is the operator of the Cheyenne Connector. The Cheyenne Connector is fully subscribed under long-term transportation contracts with us and third party shippers.
NGL Fractionation Facilities
We own a 12.5% interest in the Enterprise fractionator operated by Enterprise and a 20% interest in the Mont Belvieu 1 fractionator operated by ONEOK Partners, both located in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The fractionation facilities separate NGLs received from processing plants into their individual components. These fractionation services are provided on a fee basis. The results of operations for this business are generally dependent upon the volume of NGLs fractionated and the level of fees charged to customers.
Storage Facilities
Our Marysville NGL storage facility, which stores ethane, propane and butane, is located in Michigan and has strategic access to Marcellus, Utica and Canadian NGLs. Our facility includes 11 underground salt caverns with approximately 8 MMBbls of storage capacity. Our facility serves regional refining and petrochemical demand, and helps to balance the seasonality of propane distribution in the Midwestern and Northeastern United States and in Sarnia, Canada. We provide services to customers primarily on a fee basis under multi-year storage agreements. The results of operations for this business are generally dependent upon the volume stored and the level of fees charged to customers.
Our Spindletop natural gas storage facility is located in Texas and plays an important role in our ability to act as a full-service natural gas marketer. The facility has capacity for residue gas of approximately 12 Bcf. We may lease a portion of the facility’s capacity to third-party customers, and use the balance to manage relatively constant natural gas supply volumes with uneven demand levels, provide “backup” service to our customers and support our asset-based trading activities. Our asset based trading activities are designed to realize margins related to fluctuations in commodity prices, time spreads and basis differentials and to maximize the value of our storage facility.
Trading and Marketing
Our energy trading operations are exposed to market variables and commodity price risk. We manage commodity price risk related to our natural gas storage and pipeline assets by engaging in natural gas asset based trading and marketing. We may enter into physical contracts and financial instruments with the objective of realizing a positive margin from the purchase and sale of commodity-based instruments. 
Our NGL proprietary trading activity includes trading energy related products and services. We undertake these activities through the use of fixed forward sales and purchases, basis and spread trades, storage opportunities, put/call options, term contracts and spot market trading. Our energy trading operations are exposed to market variables and commodity price risk with respect to these products and services, and these operations may enter into physical contracts and financial instruments with the objective of realizing a positive margin from the purchase and sale of commodity-based instruments.
We may execute a time spread transaction when the difference between the current price of natural gas (cash or futures) and the futures market price for natural gas exceeds our cost of storing physical gas in our owned and/or leased storage facilities. The time spread transaction allows us to lock in a margin when this market condition exists. A time spread transaction is executed by establishing a long gas position at one point in time and establishing an equal short gas position at a different point in time. 
We may execute basis spread transactions when the market price differential between locations on a pipeline asset exceeds our cost of transporting physical gas through our owned and/or leased pipeline assets. When this market condition exists, we may execute derivative instruments around this differential at the market price. The basis spread transaction allows us to lock in a margin on our physical purchases and sales of gas. 
Customers and Contracts
We sell our commodities to a variety of customers ranging from large, multi-national petrochemical and refining companies to small regional retail propane distributors. Substantially all of our NGL sales are made at market-based prices.
Competition
The Logistics and Marketing business is highly competitive in our markets and includes interstate and intrastate pipelines, integrated oil and gas companies that produce, fractionate, transport, store and sell natural gas and NGLs, and underground storage facilities. Competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and strong petrochemical demand and during periods of high NGL prices relative to natural gas. Competition is also increased in those geographic areas where our contracts with our customers are shorter term and therefore must be renegotiated on a more frequent basis.
Competition in the NGLs marketing area comes from other midstream NGL marketing companies, international producers/traders, chemical companies, refineries and other asset owners. Along with numerous marketing competitors, we offer price risk management and other services. We believe it is important that we tailor our services to the end-use customer to remain competitive.
Gathering and Processing Segment
General
Our Gathering and Processing segment consists of a geographically diverse complement of assets and ownership interests that provide a varied array of wellhead to market services for our producer customers in Alabama, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. These services include gathering, compressing, treating, and processing natural gas, producing and fractionating NGLs, and recovering condensate. Our Gathering and Processing segment’s operations are organized into four regions: North, Permian, Midcontinent and South. Our geographic diversity helps to mitigate our natural gas supply risk in that we are not tied to one natural gas resource type or producing area. We believe our current geographic mix of assets is an important factor for the maintenance and long term growth of overall volumes and cash flow for this segment. Our assets are positioned in certain areas with active drilling programs and opportunities for organic growth.
We provide our producer customers with gathering and processing services that allow them to move their raw (unprocessed) natural gas to market. Raw natural gas is gathered, compressed and transported through pipelines to our processing facilities. In order for the raw natural gas to be accepted by the downstream market, we remove water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide and separate NGLs for further processing. Processed natural gas, usually referred to as residue natural gas, is then recompressed and delivered to natural gas pipelines and end users. The separated NGLs are in a mixed, unfractionated form and are sold and delivered through natural gas liquids pipelines to fractionation facilities for further separation. 
We own or operate 36 active natural gas processing plants, including an interest in a plant through our 40% equity interest in Discovery Producer Services, LLC, or Discovery. At some of these facilities, we fractionate NGLs into individual components (ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline). 
We receive natural gas from a diverse group of producers under contracts with varying durations, and we receive fees or commodities from the producers to transport the natural gas from the wellhead to the processing plant. We receive fees or commodities as payment for our natural gas processing services, depending on the types of contracts we enter into with each supplier. We purchase or take custody of substantially all of our natural gas from producers, principally under fee-based or percent-of-proceeds/index processing contracts.
We actively seek new producing customers of natural gas on all of our systems to increase throughput volume and to offset natural declines in the production from connected wells. We obtain new natural gas supplies in our operating areas by contracting for production from new wells, by connecting new wells drilled on dedicated acreage and by obtaining natural gas that has been directly received or released from other gathering systems.
Our contracts with our producing customers in our Gathering and Processing segment are a mix of non-commodity sensitive fee-based contracts and commodity sensitive percent-of-proceeds and percent-of-liquids contracts. Percent-of-proceeds contracts are directly related to the price of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and percent-of-liquids contracts are directly related to the price of NGLs and condensate. Additionally, these contracts may include fee-based components. Generally, the initial term of these purchase agreements is three to five years and in some cases, the life of the lease. As we negotiate new agreements and renegotiate existing agreements, this may result in a change in contract mix period over period.
We enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk of weakening natural gas, NGL and condensate prices associated with our gathering, processing and sales activities, thereby stabilizing our cash flows. Our commodity derivative instruments used for our hedging program are a combination of direct NGL product, crude oil, and natural gas hedges.
During 2022, total wellhead volume on our assets was approximately 4.4 Bcf/d, originating from a diversified mix of customers. Our systems each have significant customer acreage dedications that we expect will continue to provide opportunities for growth as those customers execute their drilling plans over time. Our gathering systems also attract new natural gas volumes through numerous smaller acreage dedications and by contracting with undedicated producers who are operating in or around our gathering footprint. During 2022, the combined NGL production from our processing facilities was approximately 421 MBbls/d and was delivered and sold into various NGL takeaway pipelines.

(a) Represents total capacity or total volumes allocated to our proportionate ownership share.
North Region
Our North region primarily consists of our DJ Basin system. We have a broad network of gathering, compression, treating, and processing facilities in Weld County, Colorado that provide significant optionality and flexibility.
Our DJ Basin system delivers to the Mont Belvieu hub in Mont Belvieu, Texas via the Southern Hills, Front Range and Texas Express pipelines, to the Conway hub in Bushton, Kansas via our Wattenberg pipeline, and Rockies Express Cheyenne Hub via the Cheyenne Connector.
Midcontinent Region
Our Midcontinent region primarily includes our Liberal system and South Central Oklahoma system. We gather and process raw natural gas primarily from the Ardmore and Anadarko Basins, including the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province (“SCOOP”) play and the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher (“STACK”) play.
Our gathering system footprint in the eastern Midcontinent region, which includes our South Central Oklahoma system, serves the SCOOP and STACK plays. Existing production in the western Midcontinent region, which includes our Liberal system in the Hugoton Basin, is typically from mature fields with shallow decline profiles that we expect will provide our plants with a dependable source of raw natural gas over a long term. We believe the infrastructure of our plants and gathering facilities is uniquely positioned to pursue our consolidation strategy in the western Midcontinent region. 
Our gathering and processing assets in the Midcontinent region deliver NGLs primarily to the Gulf Coast and Mont Belvieu via our Southern Hills pipeline.
Permian Region
Our Permian region primarily includes our West Texas system in the Midland Basin, our Southeast New Mexico system in the Delaware Basin, and our James Lake System that has connectivity to both the Midland and Delaware Basins. Producers continue to focus drilling activity on the most attractive acreage in the Midland and Delaware Basins. 
Our gathering and processing assets in the Permian region provide NGL takeaway service via our Sand Hills pipeline, to fractionation facilities along the Gulf Coast and to the Mont Belvieu hub. The Guadalupe pipeline provides gas takeaway from Waha to Katy, Texas. Through our ownership interest in the Gulf Coast Express pipeline we provide additional gas takeaway in the region. In the third quarter of 2022 we completed the acquisition of the James Lake System and a 120MMcf/d cryogenic processing facility that provides connectivity to the Delaware and Midland Basins.
South Region
Our South region primarily includes our Eagle Ford system, East Texas system, and our 40% interest in the Discovery system. We are pursuing cost efficiencies and increasing the utilization of our existing assets.
Our Eagle Ford system delivers NGLs to the Gulf Coast petrochemical markets and to Mont Belvieu through our Sand Hills pipeline and other third party NGL pipelines. Our East Texas system provides NGL takeaway service through the Panola pipeline, owned 15% by us, and delivers gas primarily through its Carthage Hub which delivers residue gas to multiple interstate and intrastate pipelines. 
The Discovery system is operated by Williams Partners L.P., which owns a 60% interest, and offers a full range of wellhead-to-market services to both onshore and offshore natural gas producers. The assets are primarily located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana, and have access to downstream pipelines and markets. 
Competition
We face strong competition in acquiring raw natural gas supplies. Our competitors in obtaining additional gas supplies and in gathering and processing raw natural gas include major integrated oil and gas companies, interstate and intrastate pipelines, and companies that gather, compress, treat, process, transport, store and/or market natural gas. Competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs. Competition is also increased in those geographic areas where our commercial contracts with our customers are shorter term and therefore must be renegotiated on a more frequent basis.
We have no revenue attributable to international activities.
REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Safety and Maintenance Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT, under the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended, or HLPSA, and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. The HLPSA and implementing regulations apply to interstate and intrastate pipeline facilities and the pipeline transportation of liquid petroleum and petroleum products, including NGLs and condensate, and require any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the United States Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations.
We are also subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, or NGPSA, and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act establishes mandatory inspections for all United States oil and natural gas transportation pipelines in high-consequence areas within 10 years. DOT, through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), has developed regulations implementing the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act that requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other safety protections in areas where the consequences of potential pipeline accidents pose the greatest risk to people and their property.
Pipeline safety legislation enacted in 2012, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the Pipeline Safety and Job Creations Act) reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increases penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines, including the expansion of integrity management, use of automatic and remote-controlled shut-off valves, leak detection systems, sufficiency of existing regulation of gathering pipelines, use of excess flow valves, verification of maximum allowable operating pressure, incident notification, and other pipeline-safety related requirements. New rules promulgated by DOT’s PHMSA address many areas of this legislation, as described below. We currently estimate we will incur approximately $92 million between 2023 and 2027 to implement integrity management program testing along certain segments of our natural gas transmission and NGL pipelines under Parts 192 and 195. This does not include the costs, if any, of any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, nor is it inclusive of estimated costs to implement the Final Gathering Rule (as defined and discussed in further detail below).
The Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act requires more stringent oversight of pipelines and increased civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules. The legislation gave PHMSA civil penalty authority up to $213,268 per day per violation, with a maximum of $2,132,679 for any related series of violations. Any material penalties or fines under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
On December 21, 2020, the U.S. Congress passed the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (the 2020 Act). The Act reauthorizes the federal pipeline safety program through September 30, 2023, and establishes annual funding levels through 2023. The 2020 Act also requires PHMSA to issue new rules for gas pipeline leak detection and repair programs and idle pipelines, and issue final rulemakings for gas gathering lines, class location changes, and the definition of unusually sensitive areas. The 2020 Act establishes additional due process requirements applicable to PHMSA enforcement actions, authorizes a new declaratory order proceeding, and obligates PHMSA to consider an operator’s self-report in assessing a civil penalty.
On January 11, 2021, PHMSA published a Final Rule amending certain gas pipeline safety regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 191 and 192 (the "Final Rule"). Although the effective date of the Final Rule is March 12, 2021, PHMSA provided a deferred compliance date of October 1, 2021. Among other changes, these Part 192 changes include provisions allowing operators to remotely monitor cathodic protection rectifier stations, provided that they perform annual testing by physical inspection of the rectifier. The Final Rule also adjusts the monetary property damage threshold in the definition of an “incident” from $50,000 to $122,000 to account for inflation, with a commitment to update the threshold annually using a defined formula. The Final Rule incorporates certain industry standards for construction of plastic pipes and changes test factors for pressure vessels.
On November 15, 2021, PHMSA published a Final Rule amending the gas pipeline safety regulations at 49 CFR Parts 191 and 192 to extend regulation over larger diameter gas gathering pipelines located in rural (Class 1) locations (the “Final Gathering Rule”). The Final Gathering Rule imposes Part 191 or Part 192 requirements on such rural gathering pipelines. All rural gathering pipelines will be subject to annual and incident reporting under Part 191, while those pipelines over 8.625 inches in diameter that are operated at a maximum allowable operating pressure ("MAOP") of more than 20% of specified minimum yield strength ("SMYS") or, where SMYS is not known, where the MAOP exceeds 125 psig, must also comply with certain Part 192 requirements. The applicable Part 192 requirements increase with increased diameter and with proximity to buildings intended for human occupancy or impacted sites. For gathering pipelines between 8.625 inches and 16 inches in diameter, the new regulations require annual and incident reporting, as well as design and construction standards, damage prevention, and emergency planning on new pipelines or those that are repaired or replaced or otherwise substantially changed. If the potential impact radius of the pipeline segment includes a building intended for human occupancy or an impacted site, corrosion control, line markers, public awareness and leakage survey and repair for pipelines of less than 12.75 inches in diameter are also added, and MAOP requirements and standards for plastic pipelines for lines are added for pipelines between 12.75 inches and 16 inches in diameter. Pipelines of more than 16 inches in diameter are subject to all of the above, whether or not the potential impact radius includes any structures intended for human occupancy or impacted sites. The Part 191 reporting requirements of the Final Gathering Rule took effect on May 16, 2022. The remaining Part 192 requirements were to take effect on November 15, 2022 or May 16, 2023, depending on the rule section. However, following GPA Midstream Association’s petition for judicial review of the new rule, PHMSA agreed to stay enforcement until May 16, 2024 with respect to smaller-diameter pipelines (8.625 to 12.75 inches). We believe that we will be able to meet the requirements of the Final Gathering Rule in all material respects by the dates set forth in the Final Gathering Rule.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the Final Gathering Rule on our operations and compliance programs. We are also evaluating opportunities to reduce the number of miles of pipeline that will be subject to the Final Gathering Rule, including changes in operating pressures and system reconfiguration or optimization. 
Finally, the Company is evaluating the cost impact of the Final Gathering Rule, which depends on the results of our analysis of pipeline data. We currently estimate that we will incur costs of approximately $100 million to implement the requirements of the Final Gathering Rule, and we will refine that number as we complete our analysis.
We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the NGPSA and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Safety and Job Creation Act, and to the extent we make changes to our program to reflect the 2020 Act, we expect to be in material compliance by the effective dates of the new regulations promulgated under the 2020 Act.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety, but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards. In practice, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. We do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable state laws and regulations in those states in which we or the entities in which we own an interest operate. Our natural gas transmission and regulated gathering pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
In addition, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We and the entities in which we own an interest are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The OSHA regulations apply to any process that involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds, or any process that involves flammable liquid or gas, pressurized tanks, caverns and wells holding or handling these materials in quantities in excess of 10,000 pounds at various locations. Flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks at temperatures below the normal 
boiling point of the liquids without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt from these standards. The EPA regulations have similar applicability thresholds. We implement these safety programs, and we have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
FERC and State Regulation of Operations
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines, the marketing and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce and the transportation of NGLs in interstate commerce may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services. Regulation of gathering systems and intrastate transportation of natural gas and NGLs by state agencies may also affect our business.
Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Our Cimarron River, Discovery, Cheyenne Connector, and Dauphin Island Gathering Partners systems, or portions thereof, are some of our natural gas pipeline assets that are subject to regulation by FERC, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended, or NGA. Natural gas companies subject to the NGA may only charge rates that have been determined to be just and reasonable. In addition, FERC authority over natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce includes:
•certification and construction of new facilities;
•abandonment of services and facilities;
•maintenance of accounts and records;
•acquisition and disposition of facilities;
•initiation and discontinuation of transportation services;
•terms and conditions of transportation services and service contracts with customers;
•depreciation and amortization policies;
•conduct and relationship with certain affiliates; and
•various other matters.
Generally, the maximum filed recourse rates for an interstate natural gas pipeline's transportation services are based on the pipeline's cost of service including recovery of and a return on the pipeline’s actual prudent investment cost. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are costs of providing service, allowed rate of return and volume throughput and contractual capacity commitment assumptions. The allocation of costs to various pipeline services and the manner in which rates are designed also can impact a pipeline's profitability. The maximum applicable recourse rates and terms and conditions for service are set forth in each pipeline’s FERC-approved gas tariff. FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines are permitted to discount their firm and interruptible rates without further FERC authorization down to the minimum rate or variable cost of performing service, provided they do not “unduly discriminate.”
Tariff changes can only be implemented upon approval by FERC. Two primary methods are available for changing the rates, terms and conditions of service of an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under the first method, the pipeline voluntarily seeks a tariff change by making a tariff filing with FERC justifying the proposed tariff change and providing notice, generally 30 days, to the appropriate parties. If FERC determines, as required by the NGA, that a proposed change is just and reasonable, FERC will accept the proposed change and the pipeline will implement such change in its tariff. However, if FERC determines that a proposed change may not be just and reasonable as required by NGA, then FERC may suspend such change for up to five months beyond the date on which the change would otherwise go into effect and set the matter for an administrative hearing. Subsequent to any suspension period ordered by FERC, the proposed change may be placed into effect by the company, pending final FERC approval. In most cases, a proposed rate increase is placed into effect before a final FERC determination on such rate increase, and the proposed increase is collected subject to refund (plus interest). Under the second method, FERC may, on its own motion or based on a complaint, initiate a proceeding to compel the company to change or justify its rates, terms and/or conditions of service. If FERC determines that the existing rates, terms and/or conditions of service are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, then any rate reduction or change that it orders generally will be effective prospectively from the date of the FERC order requiring this change.
The natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that a more stringent regulatory approach will not be pursued by FERC and Congress, especially in light of potential market power abuse by marketing companies engaged in interstate commerce. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPACT 2005, Congress amended the NGA and Federal Power Act to add anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. EPACT 2005 prohibits the use of any “manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance” in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas, electric energy or 
transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. FERC adopted market manipulation and market behavior rules to implement the authority granted under EPACT 2005. These rules, which prohibit fraud and manipulation in wholesale energy markets, are subject to broad interpretation. Given FERC's broad mandate granted in EPACT 2005, if energy prices are high, or exhibit what FERC deems to be “unusual” trading patterns, FERC may investigate energy markets to determine if behavior unduly impacted or “manipulated” energy prices.
In addition, EPACT 2005 gave FERC increased penalty authority for violations of the NGA and FERC's rules and regulations thereunder. FERC may issue civil penalties of up to $1.5 million per day per violation, and violators may be subject to criminal penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation and five years in prison. FERC may also order disgorgement of profits obtained in violation of FERC rules. FERC relies on its enforcement authority in issuing a number of natural gas enforcement actions. Failure to comply with the NGA and FERC's rules and regulations thereunder could result in the imposition of civil penalties and disgorgement of profits.
Under the NGA and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, FERC has broad authority to approve the construction of new interstate natural gas pipeline facilities, including imposing environmental conditions on certificates of public convenience and necessity. In February 2022, FERC issued new policy guidance that details what FERC will consider in evaluating new pipeline infrastructure projects. Considerations include, among general public benefit and adverse effect analyses, impacts on: greenhouse gas emissions, the environment, environmental justice communities, existing customers of pending projects, existing pipelines and their customers, and landowners. FERC subsequently amended these policies in March 2022 to make them draft policies only, which renders them inoperable unless and until final policies are issued. Since then, FERC has requested and received comments on the draft policies. Depending on the outcome of these policies and the promulgation of new policies, regulations or statutes, new pipeline infrastructure projects could face increased scrutiny and enhanced regulatory reviews by federal, state and/or environmental regulators due to an increased focus on climate change policies and the fossil fuel industry. While we do not currently have projects pending that are subject to material risk, any governmental or regulatory actions that place additional burdens and/or costs on future projects, could adversely impact our ability to develop new infrastructure.
Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are not generally subject to rate regulation by FERC, but they are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While the regulatory regime varies from state to state, state agencies typically require intrastate gas pipelines to provide service that is not unduly discriminatory and to file and/or seek approval of their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases. For example, our Guadalupe system and Gulf Coast Express pipeline are intrastate pipelines regulated as a gas utility by the Railroad Commission. To the extent that an intrastate pipeline system transports natural gas in interstate commerce, the rates and terms and conditions of such interstate transportation service are subject to FERC rules and regulations under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA. Certain of our systems are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA for their interstate transportation services. Section 311 regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. Under Section 311, rates charged for transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by FERC at least once every five years. Additionally, the terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate pipeline’s Statement of Operating Conditions are subject to FERC approval. Non-compliance with FERC's rules and regulations established under Section 311 of the NGPA, including failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by FERC for Section 311 service, and failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline’s FERC-approved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties. Among other matters, EPACT 2005 also amended the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGPA up to $1 million for any one violation and violators may be subject to criminal penalties of up to $1 million per violation and five years in prison. 
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC under the NGA. We believe that our natural gas gathering facilities meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services continues to be a current issue in various FERC proceedings with respect to facilities that interconnect gathering and processing plants with nearby interstate pipelines, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC and the courts. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and, in many circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation.
Our purchasing, gathering and intrastate transportation operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate. The ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas.
Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels where FERC has recognized a jurisdictional exemption for the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies and a number of such companies have transferred gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. Many of the producing states have adopted some form of complaint-based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination. Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Other Laws - Texas Weather Emergencies
In 2021, in response to Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, the State of Texas implemented new laws related to preparing for, preventing and responding to weather emergencies and power outages. Under the new law, several state agencies, including the Railroad Commission, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (“TPUC”), and the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) are required to coordinate and implement new rules and processes related to weather emergencies impacting gas-fired electric generation and the natural gas production and supply chain. The Railroad Commission and TPUC implemented rules related to the critical designation of natural gas infrastructure and electric service to such critical infrastructure during an emergency. The Railroad Commission designated natural gas processing plants, natural gas pipelines and related facilities, and natural gas storage, in addition gas production and distribution facilities, as critical. We are obligated to develop a listing of our critical natural gas facilities and update it semi-annually. Electric utilities are obligated to review our critically designated facility listings and establish priorities during load shed events. The law further requires the agencies to “map” the supply chain of natural gas to electric generation facilities; natural gas facilities that are deemed critical to the supply of electricity will be required to implement measures to prepare to operate during a winter weather emergency (“weatherize”). Several of our facilities in Texas, including gas processing, gas storage and gas pipeline and compression facilities have been deemed critical to the supply of electric generation and are subject to new weatherization rules implemented by the Railroad Commission. Such critical facilities are required to implement weather emergency preparation measures and attest to such measures annually. Failure to comply with the Railroad Commission’s weatherization requirements is subject to a penalty of up to $1 million dollars per violation.
Sales of Natural Gas
The price at which we buy and sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our interstate purchases and sales of natural gas, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, in additional to civil and criminal penalties, we could be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to FERC jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes to our natural gas marketing operations.
Interstate NGL Pipeline Regulation
Certain of our pipelines, including Sand Hills and Southern Hills, are common carriers that provide interstate NGL transportation services subject to FERC regulation. FERC regulates interstate common carriers under its Oil Pipeline Regulations, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, as amended, or ICA, and the Elkins Act of 1903, as amended. FERC requires that common carriers file tariffs containing all the rates, charges and other terms for services provided by such pipelines. The ICA requires that tariffs apply to the interstate movement of NGLs, as is the case with the Sand Hills, Southern Hills, Black Lake, Wattenberg and Front Range pipelines. Pursuant to the ICA, rates must be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, and can be challenged at FERC either by protest when they are initially filed or increased or by complaint at any time they remain on file with FERC.
In October 1992, Congress passed EPACT, which among other things, required FERC to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for pipelines regulated by FERC pursuant to the ICA. FERC responded to this mandate by issuing several orders, including Order No. 561 that enables common carrier pipelines to charge rates up to their ceiling levels, which are adjusted annually based on an inflation index. Specifically, the indexing methodology requires a pipeline to adjust the ceiling level for its rates annually by the inflation index established by the FERC. FERC reviews the indexing methodology every five years, and in 2020, the indexing methodology for the five years beginning July 1, 2021 was changed to be the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods plus 0.78%; however, after considering rehearing requests, the FERC revised its decision and adjusted the five-year index to the Producer Price Index minus 0.21%. The new ceiling levels and revised tariff rates implementing the revised index were required to be filed with FERC effective March 1, 2022. The FERC’s current five-year indexing methodology is subject to review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline’s filed rate, the pipeline is required to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling unless doing so would reduce a rate “grandfathered” under EPACT below the grandfathered level. A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates. FERC, however, retained cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement as alternatives to the indexing approach, which alternatives may be used in certain specified circumstances. The ceiling levels calculated for our interstate NGL pipelines are typically increased each year pursuant to the indexing methodology, but may be subject to decrease, which occurred in 2016 and 2021 and resulted in the decrease in many of the tariff rates for such pipelines. The ceiling levels for our interstate NGL pipelines were further decreased effective March 1, 2022, as a result of the revised 2021 index; however, many of the tariff rates were below the ceiling level and will remain unchanged. The index effective July 1, 2022, was positive based on the Producer's Price Index for Finished Goods, resulting in an increase to tariff rates. 
In December 2022, FERC issued a notice of proposed policy statement in which FERC proposes to revise its policy for evaluating whether contractual committed transportation service complies with the Interstate Commerce Act where the only shipper to obtain the contractual committed service is the pipeline’s affiliate. FERC’s proposed policy is intended to evaluate the rate and non-rate terms offered in an open season for new capacity to ensure they are not structured to favor the pipeline’s affiliate and to exclude nonaffiliates. The policy, when finalized, would apply to future interstate committed service offerings. While no final policy has been issued, FERC’s proposed policy would place additional burdens and scrutiny on such transactions. We do not anticipate any changes to existing affiliate-only contractual committed transportation service. 
Intrastate NGL Pipeline Regulation
NGL and other common carrier petroleum pipelines that provide intrastate transportation services are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While the regulatory regime varies from state to state, state agencies typically require intrastate petroleum pipelines to file tariffs and their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases. For example, certain of our pipelines have tariffs filed with the Railroad Commission for their intrastate NGL transportation services. The intrastate tariffs for many of our intrastate NGL pipelines rely on the FERC indexing methodology for annual adjustments to rates when the index is positive and remain unchanged when the index is negative.
Environmental Matters
General
Our operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, fractionating, storing or selling natural gas, NGLs and other products is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the emission or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:
•requiring the acquisition of permits or authorizations to conduct regulated activities and imposing obligations in those permits, potentially including capital expenditures or operational requirements, that reduce or limit impacts to the environment;
•requiring changes or additions to our equipment or facilities, or changes to our operations, pursuant to government-promulgated regulations to protect the environment, including air quality and reduction of greenhouse gases;
•restricting the ways that we can handle or dispose of our wastes; 
•limiting or prohibiting construction or operational activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by threatened and endangered species;
•requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and
•enjoining, or compelling changes to, the operations of facilities deemed not to be in compliance with environmental regulations or with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil, or potentially criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, potential citizen lawsuits, and the issuance of orders enjoining or affecting current or future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict liability or joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, or in some cases hydrocarbons, have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for property damage or personal injury allegedly caused by the release of substances or other waste products into the environment.
The overall trend in federal and state environmental programs is to expand regulatory requirements, placing more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations, participate as applicable in the public process to ensure such new requirements are well-founded and reasonable or seek to revise them if they are not, and to manage the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations.
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Below is a discussion of the more significant environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Impact of Air Quality Standards and Climate Change
A number of states have adopted or considered programs to reduce greenhouse gases, or GHGs, which includes methane. Depending on the particular program or jurisdiction, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances, either for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., compressor units) or from downstream combustion of fuels (e.g., NGLs or natural gas) that we process, or we may otherwise be required by regulation to take steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. 
At the federal level, the EPA has taken several actions to regulate emissions of GHGs. In 2010, the EPA found that certain GHGs “endanger” public health and welfare and that GHG vehicle emissions contribute to the GHG pollution threatening public health and welfare, thus triggering regulation of GHG emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks. The EPA's 2010 action on the GHG vehicle emission rule triggered regulation of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions from stationary sources under certain Clean Air Act programs at both the federal and state levels, including the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) program and Title V permitting. Most recently, in 2016, the EPA proposed PSD and Title V permitting 
regulations that would address control of GHG emissions if certain thresholds are met. While the EPA has not finalized the rule, states such as Colorado have adopted similar requirements. The EPA also has issued various rules relating to the mandatory reporting of GHG emissions, including mandatory reporting requirements of GHGs from petroleum and natural gas systems, which encompasses all segments of the oil and gas sector. 
The EPA has adopted federal new source performance standards (“NSPS”) for new and modified oil and gas sector sources that regulate emissions of VOCs and methane from these sources. EPA promulgated the NSPS for VOCs in 2012 and the NSPS for VOCs and methane in 2016. The regulations, contained in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart OOOO and OOOOa, require, among other things, control of VOC and methane emissions from subject sources through ensuring adequate design, requiring installation of emission controls, and institution of leak detection and repair programs. In November 2021, the EPA proposed regulations that expand the scope and breadth of the existing regulations. The 2021 proposed rules include provisions that: 1) extend emission control and reduction requirements under this part of the Clean Air Act to existing sources, which is a first; and 2) expand and tighten the existing emission reduction requirements for new or modified sources adopted in 2012 and 2016. In December 2022, EPA issued a supplemental proposal to update, strengthen and expand the 2021 proposed rules. EPA is expected to finalize the rule in 2023.
States’ efforts to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone, which is set by the EPA, also may have an impact on our operations. States or areas of a state that are not in attainment with the ozone NAAQS are required to approve implementation plans that reduce emissions of ozone precursors in order to achieve compliance with the NAAQS, which plans can impose emissions control requirements and associated costs on us or on our customers. In October 2015, the EPA finalized a reduction of the ambient ozone standard from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under the Clean Air Act, and in December 2018 EPA published a final rule “Implementation of the 2015 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone: Nonattainment Area State Implementation Plan Requirements.” The EPA in October 2016 issued Control Techniques Guidelines (“CTGs”) for emissions of volatile organic compounds from oil and gas sector sources that were to be implemented or utilized by states in ozone nonattainment areas. Under the Trump Administration, the EPA on December 31, 2020, issued a final rule retaining the 2015 standard at 70 parts per billion. However, in late 2021, the EPA communicated that it would reconsider the 2020 decision to retain the ozone NAAQS with the intention of completing the reconsideration by the end of 2023. If the ozone NAAQS is lowered, it may result in additional actions by states requiring further emission controls and associated costs.

In relation to addressing the ozone NAAQS but more specifically greenhouse gas emissions, on January 29, 2019, the New Mexico governor issued an executive order establishing an interagency Climate Change Task Force and directing the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (“EMNRD”) and the New Mexico Environment Department (“NMED”) to develop a statewide, enforceable regulatory framework to reduce methane emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas sector. The Oil Conservation Division ("OCD") adopted the EMNRD rules in mid-2021, which institute gas capture requirements for both upstream and midstream operators, prohibit routine flaring, and require operation plans for operators of gas gathering systems. In 2022, the NMED adopted an Ozone Precursor rule crafted with the intention of preventing the state from falling into non-attainment with the ozone NAAQS by controlling ozone precursor pollutants, including nitrogen oxides ("NOx") and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), from the oil and gas industry, which will also have the associated effect of controlling or reducing methane emissions. The rule establishes emission standards and emission reduction requirements for various equipment and processes as well as leak detection and repair requirements. We anticipate that the NMED rule will impose additional operational costs and potential regulatory compliance and enforcement risks.
Similarly, Colorado has undertaken various rulemakings to address compliance with and attainment of the ozone NAAQS, including regulations in 2019 and 2020 to reduce emissions of NOx and VOCs from the oil and gas sector. These regulations, as an example, impose emissions standards on our compressor engines in the Ozone Non-Attainment Area, which, in turn, requires the installation of emissions control technologies and work practice standards to manage emissions. Further, in 2019 the Colorado legislature enacted HB19-1261 establishing statewide greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and included agency authorities and mandates to promulgate regulations to achieve greenhouse gas reduction goals. In January 2021 the governor issued the “Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmap,” which describes state actions and the regulatory pathway to achieve the HB19-1261 greenhouse gas reduction goals. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap specifies, among other things, intended reductions by economic sector, including the oil and gas sector as well as the “residential, commercial and industrial” sector that includes emissions from the combustion of fuels. In 2021, Governor Polis signed HB21-1266 into law, which includes environmental justice provisions and requirements for adoption of rules for reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from “oil and gas exploration, production, processing, transmission, and storage operations” by at least 36% by 2025 and 60% by 2030 below a 2005 baseline. These administrative and regulatory actions have been and will be pursued by various state agencies, including the Colorado Energy Office and the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission 
(“AQCC”). In December 2021, the AQCC adopted regulations to reduce GHGs from the oil and gas sector through myriad requirements to address emissions and control requirements, including emissions reduction requirements for production well sites, and capture requirements for pigging activities and capture and control requirements for equipment blowdowns. The AQCC also adopted requirements for a Steering Committee to assess methods and feasibility to reduce GHG emissions from industrial combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, specifically including oil and gas sector compression equipment to gather and transport natural gas, ultimately resulting in plans and regulations for oil and gas sector industrial combustion equipment to achieve the HB21-1266 reduction goals. Effective November 7, 2022, Colorado's front range was reclassified from a “serious” to a “severe” nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone standard. In December 2022, the AQCC approved revisions to the State’s Implementation Plan to further reduce emissions of VOCs and NOx to come into compliance with the ozone standards. Additional future rulemakings from the AQCC are expected to yet further reduce emissions of VOCs and NOx from the oil and gas sector as part of the State’s Implementation Plan to come into compliance with the ozone standards. 
The regulations in New Mexico and Colorado collectively are anticipated to impose near- and longer-term obligations and costs on our producer customers as well as on our own midstream equipment and facilities. These rulemaking proceedings to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could increase costs on or inhibit or adversely influence the ability of our producer customers to develop and operate production wells. These rulemaking proceedings could increase costs for us to operate our compressor stations or gas plants in the respective states, and they could affect the types of equipment or the manner in which we operate our midstream equipment. These rulemaking proceedings, or future related rulemaking proceedings, have the potential to result in some manner of greenhouse gas emissions caps in the state, or greenhouse gas sector-specific performance standards, either of which could result in increased costs on our producer customers or increased costs on us to operate our facilities, and could affect the types of equipment that we operate or the manner in which it is operated. These rulemaking proceedings have the potential to affect the operations and production of our customers, which can in turn affect our operations, and they also have the potential to affect our costs and facility operations, either of which could adversely affect our financial results or have such an effect on our operations.
The Clean Air Act imposes substantial potential civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with or deviations from applicable regulations or permits. State laws for the control of air pollution also provide varying administrative, civil and potentially criminal penalties and liabilities. The permitting, regulatory compliance and reporting programs, including those detailed above, taken as a whole, increase the costs and complexity of oil and gas operations with the potential to adversely affect the cost of doing business for our customers resulting in reduced demand for our gas processing and transportation services, and which may also require us to incur certain capital and operating expenditures in the future to meet regulatory requirements or for air pollution control equipment, for example, in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions associated with our facilities and operations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, or solid or hazardous wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict liability or joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas at a facility or a location where hazardous substances, or in some cases hydrocarbons, may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of, or transported the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible parties the costs that the agency incurs. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of CERCLA Section 101(14), which encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the ordinary course of our operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum and natural gas production wastes are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. However, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, may in the future be designated by the EPA as hazardous wastes and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our sustaining capital expenditures and operating expenses.
We currently own or lease properties where petroleum hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under the other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties may have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws, or separate state laws that address hydrocarbon releases. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate releases of hydrocarbon materials, or previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), or to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to contribute to or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to the application of such requirements that could reasonably have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Water
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also referred to as the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. Pursuant to the CWA and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The CWA also requires implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of threshold quantities of oil or certain other materials. The CWA imposes substantial potential civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance. State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying administrative, civil and potentially criminal penalties and liabilities. In addition, some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater. The EPA has also promulgated regulations that require us to have permits in order to discharge certain storm water. The EPA has entered into agreements with certain states in which we operate whereby the permits are issued and administered by the respective states. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water discharges. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to the application of such requirements that could reasonably have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which is part of the Clean Water Act, addresses prevention, containment and cleanup, and liability associated with oil pollution. OPA applies to vessels, offshore platforms, and onshore facilities, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, terminals, pipelines, and transfer facilities. OPA subjects owners of such facilities to strict liability for containment and removal costs, natural resource damages, and certain other consequences of oil spills into jurisdictional waters. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result in government penalties and civil liability. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to the application of such requirements that could reasonably have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Anti-Terrorism Measures
The United States Department of Homeland Security regulates the security of chemical and industrial facilities pursuant to regulations known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. These regulations apply to oil and gas facilities, among others, that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” Pursuant to these regulations, certain of our facilities are required to comply with certain regulatory provisions, including requirements regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping, and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information.
Human Capital Management
Our operations and activities are managed by our general partner, GP LP, which is managed by its general partner, the General Partner, which is 100% owned by DCP Midstream, LLC. We do not have any employees. As of December 31, 2022, 1,910 employees of DCP Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DCP Midstream, LLC, provided support for our operations pursuant to the Services and Employee Secondment Agreement between DCP Services, LLC and us (the “Services Agreement”). For additional information, refer to Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” and Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Integration with Phillips 66
Following the completion of the Realignment Transaction in August of 2022, we began to integrate certain of our operations with Phillips 66’s midstream segment, including the integration of operational services that are currently, or were previously, provided by DCP Services, LLC. As part of these integration efforts, continuing employees will transfer employment to a Phillips 66 subsidiary, which we expect to occur beginning in the second quarter of 2023, and general and administrative services will be provided by Phillips 66 or one or more of its subsidiaries going forward. We expect these integration efforts to continue regardless of the outcome of our pending Merger with Phillips 66. 
The following summary of employment related matters generally refers to plans and policies in place prior to the completion of these integration efforts. Once our integration with Phillips 66 is complete, we anticipate that employees that provide support for our operations will be subject to existing plans and policies maintained by Phillips 66.
Benefits and Compensation
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our goals and create long term value for our unitholders. We incentivize our employees by providing market competitive total compensation packages, including salaries, bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, and benefits, including comprehensive medical plan options; dental, vision and life insurance; 401(k) savings matches and retirement contributions; vacation, sick, personal and wellness days; tuition and gym membership reimbursement, voluntary insurance, an employee-matching charitable gifts program, an employee assistance program and additional programs through DCP Perks. We use voluntary turnover as a key measure to track and reduce the turnover of key and critical employees, which was 8.6% in 2022.
Training and development
We believe that the high performance of our employees is a byproduct of our employees honing the skills and tools necessary to manage change and prepare for the future, and we are dedicated to the continual growth of our employees through training and development programs. We provide growth opportunities to all employees through programs ranging from individual development plans, rotational programs, tuition reimbursement, and a focused effort on succession planning tailored to each employee’s unique vision of success. Our performance review and talent development process is one in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual development plans to assist with individual career development. 
Safety, Health and Wellness
Safety is the first tenet of our vision to be the safest, most reliable, low-cost midstream service provider, and is our highest value. The importance of the safety of our employees and contractors is exemplified in our compensation structure, as every executive and employee has been directly incentivized to achieve industry-leading safety performance since 2007. Our Start SAFE Finish SAFE (“SSFS”) program provides a framework to ensure employees and contractors are starting and finishing each task or job safely. In conjunction with our SSFS program, we also have an environmental, health and safety management system database that is used to track and communicate safety related activities and events, such as audits, injuries, incidents, and near misses, including incident investigation observations and responsive actions. The Company uses (i) the employee Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”), which is the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 hours worked, and (ii) the Process Safety Event Rate (“PSER”), which is the number of process safety events per 1,000,000 work hours, as indicators of its performance. We are consistently a leader in the midstream industry for safety performance. In 2022 the company had a TRIR of 0.34 and a PSER of 0.65.
We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. These programs are designed to support employees' physical and mental health through tools and resources to help them improve their health and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors.
Inclusion and Diversity
We are committed to advancing inclusion and diversity (“I&D”) in our workplace and driving accountability for progress throughout the Company. Our leadership is dedicated to maintaining an inclusive workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination and provides advancement opportunities for all employees. We support a variety of internal employee resource groups, including our six Inclusion and Diversity subcommittees and our Business Women’s Network.
The Company demonstrated corporate leadership on inclusion and diversity by setting the following forward-looking goals via our annual sustainability report. Our Inclusion and Diversity strategy consists of a 2028 goal to ensure our workforce and leadership fully represents the gender and racial demographics of the industry's available and qualified talent within the communities in which we operate. It also includes a 2031 goal to ensure that our internal leadership succession pipeline reflects the gender and racial demographics of the available and qualified talent within the communities where we operate. Additionally, we strive to ensure that representation of our veteran communities aligns with national demographics on an annual basis. Finally, over a five-year period, we have a goal to maintain employee satisfaction and belonging scores above industry benchmark.
As part of our work to meet these goals, we piloted a first of its kind, industry centric virtual reality training across our organization, in partnership with Moth+Flame and the National Urban League. This training centered on empowering our employees to create and enable psychologically safe environments, a fundamental prerequisite for Inclusion and Diversity work. Our Business Women’s Network managed the second year of a company-wide women’s mentorship program, which partners our women leaders with emerging women leaders for formal mentorship opportunities to support increasing the number of women in leadership and management positions at the Company. 25% of DCP’s female officers and employees participated in the program in 2022. Additionally, the Business Women’s Network launched their first annual Elevate Women’s Leadership conference, hosting over 60% of DCP’s female officers and employees for a two-day conference focused on connection, professional development, and leadership skills.
