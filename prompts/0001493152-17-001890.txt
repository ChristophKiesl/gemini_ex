Item 1. Business
General Development of Business
 
We are a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of a diversified range of homeopathic and health care products that are offered to the general public. We are also engaged in the research and development of potential over-the-counter (“OTC”) drug, natural base health products along with supplements, personal care and cosmeceutical products.
 
Our primary business has been the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of OTC homeopathic and health care products, particularly cold remedy products, to consumers through national chain, regional, specialty and local retail stores. We also perform contract manufacturing services of cough drops and other OTC healthcare products for third parties. Our flagship brand is Cold-EEZE® and our principal product is Cold-EEZE® cold remedy zinc gluconate lozenges, proven in clinical studies to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold. In addition to Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges, we market and distribute non-lozenge forms of our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation, (i) Cold-EEZE® cold remedy QuickMelts®, (ii) Cold-EEZE® Gummies (see below) and (iii) Cold-EEZE® cold remedy Oral Spray. Each of our Cold-EEZE® QuickMelts® products are based on our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation in combination with certain (i) immune system support, (ii) energy, (iii) sleep and relaxation, and/or (iv) cold and flu symptom relieving active ingredients.
 
In Fiscal 2014 we introduced and began shipments in June 2014 of our new Cold-EEZE® Plus Natural Multi-Symptom QuickMelts®. In Fiscal 2015, we introduced three new Cold-EEZE® product line extensions: (i) a Cold-EEZE® Multi-Symptom Relief for Cold and Flu lozenge, (ii) a Cold-EEZE® Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid form for each of adults and children, and (iii) Cold-EEZE® Natural Allergy Relief caplets for indoor and outdoor allergies. Shipments for these three new Cold-EEZE® product line extensions began in the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2016, we expanded our Cold-EEZE® product line further to include (i) Cold-EEZE® Gummies Multi-Symptom Relief for Cold and Flu and (ii) Cold-EEZE® Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief for Cold and Flu QuickMelts®. Shipments began for these two new products in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016.
 
Cold-EEZE® is an established product in the health care and cough-cold market. For Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenues have come principally from (i) our OTC health care and cold remedy products and (ii) were related to markets in the United States.
 
As further described below under “Strategic Initiatives”, on January 6, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Mylan, pursuant to which we agreed to sell substantially all of our assets and other rights related to the Cold-EEZE® brand and product line, which is comprised principally of our intellectual property rights and other assets relating to Cold-EEZE® (collectively referred to as the “Cold-EEZE® Division”) to Mylan, subject to the approval of our stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

In addition to our Cold-EEZE® product line, we market and distribute OTC lozenge and dietary supplement products under the ORXx brand name. The ORXx brand includes the products sold under the following names: ORXx CompleteTM and ORXx DefenseTM.
 
We are also pursuing a series of new product development and pre-commercialization initiatives in the dietary supplement category. Initial dietary supplement product development activities were completed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 under the brand name of TK Supplements®. The TK Supplements® product line comprises three men’s health products: (i) Legendz XL® for sexual health, (ii) Triple Edge XL®, a daily energy booster plus testosterone support, and (iii) Super ProstaFlow PlusTM for prostate and urinary health.
 
In addition to the Company’s products, our wholly owned subsidiary, Pharmaloz Manufacturing, Inc. (“PMI”), produces our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges and other products in addition to performing operational tasks such as warehousing, customer order processing and shipping.
 
We use a December 31 year-end for financial reporting purposes. References herein to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 shall be the term “Fiscal 2016” and references to other “Fiscal” years shall mean the year, which ended on December 31 of the year indicated.
 
We were initially organized as a corporation in Nevada in July 1989. Effective June 18, 2015, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 621 N. Shady Retreat Road, Doylestown, Pennsylvania 18901 and our telephone number is 215-345-0919. The terms, “we”, “us” and the “Company” refer to the Company together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.
 
Seasonality of the Business
 
Our net sales are derived principally from our OTC health care and cold remedy products. Currently, our sales have historically been subject to fluctuations and influenced by the timing, length and severity of each cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period of September to March when the incidence of the common cold and flu rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors. We generally have experienced higher levels of net sales in the first, third and fourth quarter along with a corresponding increase in marketing and advertising expenditures designed to promote our products during the cold season. Revenues and related marketing costs are generally at their lowest levels in the second quarter when consumer demand generally declines. We track health and wellness trends and develop retail promotional strategies to align our production scheduling, inventory management and marketing programs to optimize consumer purchases.
 
Strategic Initiatives
 
In August 2016, management initiated a process to explore and evaluate a wide range of strategic initiatives and alternatives to further enhance stockholder value. These include the possible sale of core assets of the Company as well as a range of potential acquisitions. We engaged Bourne Partners, a boutique investment bank focused on the consumer health and pharmaceutical industries, to assist in our strategic review. This process was approved by the Board of Directors.
 
On January 9, 2017, we announced that we had signed an asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to sell our Cold-EEZE® Division to Mylan for $50 million before taking into account taxes, transaction costs and related deal expenses, restructuring costs and post-closing escrow requirements. We will retain ownership of our manufacturing facility and manufacturing business in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and our headquarters in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and our assets related to our ORXx and TK Supplements® brands, product lines and operations. As part of the transaction, PMI will enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Mylan pursuant to which Mylan will purchase the current inventory of the Cold-EEZE® Division and PMI will manufacture certain of the Cold-EEZE® products for Mylan.

The closing of the proposed sale, which is currently expected to occur in late March or April of 2017, is subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company and other customary closing conditions. In connection with the execution of the asset purchase agreement, our executive officers and directors executed voting agreements. The voting agreements provide, among other things, for our executive officers and directors to vote all of the shares owned by them in favor of the proposed sale. The shares subject to the voting agreements represent approximately 24.1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
 
Since the proposed sale has not been approved by our stockholders and is subject to other conditions to be completed by Mylan and the Company prior to closing, the Cold-EEZE® Division does not meet the criterion for classification of an asset held for sale or as discontinued operations. As there can be no assurance that this proposed sale or any strategic initiative will be consummated, we intend to operate our business as discussed throughout this Report.
 
Description of Our Business Operations
 
Cold-EEZE® has historically been our most popular OTC health care and cold remedy product. Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges, QuickMelts®,Oral Spray and Gummies product benefits are derived from our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation. Our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges effectiveness has been substantiated in two double-blind clinical studies proving that Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges reduce the duration of the common cold by 42%. We acquired worldwide manufacturing and distribution rights to our lozenge formulation in 1992 and commenced national marketing in 1996. In addition to our lozenge product, the Cold-EEZE® Cold Remedy proprietary zinc gluconate formulation is available in three additional cold remedy delivery forms, (i) a fast dissolving QuickMelt, (ii) an Oral Spray and (iii) a Gummies product. We also offer our product line extensions (i) Cold-EEZE® Daytime and Nighttime Multi-Symptom Relief in liquid for each of adults and children and (ii) Cold-EEZE® Natural Allergy Relief caplets for indoor and outdoor allergies.
 
Our business operations have been concentrated on the development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our proprietary Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenge products and on the development of various product extensions. Our product line of OTC homeopathic and health care products are reviewed regularly to identify new consumer opportunities and/or trends in flavor, convenience, packaging and delivery systems or forms to help improve market share for our products.
 
Although we have continued to expand our Cold-EEZE® product offerings, some retailers are limiting and/or reallocating shelf and promotional space away from the cough-cold category to other product categories. With cough-cold shelf and promotional space at a premium, opportunities in the future to introduce new Cold-EEZE® products and to compete in the competitive cough-cold category, where many other OTC product suppliers are larger and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, may be limited. For this reason, among others, we have determined that it is in our best interest to sell our Cold-EEZE® Division to Mylan and to instead focus on and grow our PMI manufacturing business, ORXx and TK Supplements® product lines and to pursue other opportunities. 
 
Initial dietary supplement product development activities were completed in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 under the brand name of TK Supplements®. The inaugural TK Supplements® product line is comprised of three men’s health products: (i) Legendz XL® for sexual health, (ii) Triple Edge XL®, a daily energy booster plus testosterone support, and (iii) Super ProstaFlow PlusTM for prostate and urinary health.
 
During Fiscal 2016, we produced, tested and refined a direct response television commercial and initiated television and digital media testing for Legendz XL®. Additionally, we completed a broad series of clinical studies which support important product claims which have now been incorporated into our product packaging and marketing communication. Our next goal is to introduce Legendz XL® in retail stores leveraging our existing infrastructure and retail distribution platform. We have received initial product acceptance into a national chain drug retailer and several regional retailers to begin shipments of Legendz XL® to such retailers during the second or third quarter of Fiscal 2017.

Once we have established a retail presence, we expect to initiate a TV campaign with short form TV spots as well as other forms of advertising designed to support our retail launch and generate additional direct-to-consumer sales, a two pronged strategy of retail and e-commerce consumer engagement. As with any new product launch, we anticipate losses from the TK Supplements® initiatives as we optimize our market strategy.
 
While management anticipates the growth potential in this category may be better, the risks associated with introducing new products that do not leverage the Cold-EEZE® brand name may be higher. Therefore, no assurance can be made that our new product efforts will be successful and/or profitable.
 
Additionally, we are active in exploring new product technologies, applications, product line extensions and other new product opportunities and will also consider and pursue other alternatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, investments and acquisitions in other sectors and industries.
 
Manufacturing Facility 
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, PMI, produces our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges and other lozenge products in addition to performing operational tasks such as warehousing, customer order processing and shipping. Our PMI facility is located in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Additionally, our PMI facility is a United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) registered facility that engages in contract manufacturing and distribution activities. PMI also produces and sells therapeutic lozenges to unaffiliated third party retail, wholesale and distribution outlets.
 
If the proposed sale of our Cold-EEZE® Division to Mylan is approved by our stockholders, PMI will enter into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Mylan, pursuant to which Mylan will purchase the current inventory of the Cold-EEZE® Division and PMI will manufacture certain of the Cold-EEZE® products for Mylan.
 
Products
 
OTC Health Care and Cold-Remedy Products
 
In May 1992, we entered into an exclusive agreement for worldwide representation, manufacturing and marketing of a zinc gluconate formulation. This zinc gluconate formulation is the foundation of our brand; Cold-EEZE® health care and cold remedy products which are distributed principally in the United States. Cold-EEZE® cold remedy products are an OTC consumer product used to reduce the duration of the common cold. We have substantiated the effectiveness of Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges through a variety of studies. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, conducted at Dartmouth College of Health Science, Hanover, New Hampshire, concluded that the lozenge formulation treatment, initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, resulted in a significant reduction in the total duration of the common cold.
 
On May 22, 1992, “Zinc and the Common Cold, a Controlled Clinical Study,” was published in England in the Journal of International Medical Research, Volume 20, Number 3, Pages 234-246. According to this publication, (a) flavorings used in other zinc lozenge products (citrate, tartrate, separate, orotate, picolinate, mannitol or sorbitol) render the zinc inactive and unavailable to the patient’s nasal passages, mouth and throat where cold symptoms have to be treated, (b) our zinc gluconate patented formulation delivers approximately 93% of the active zinc to the mucosal surfaces and (c) a patient treated with our zinc gluconate formulation has the same sequence of symptoms as in the absence of treatment but treated with our zinc gluconate formulation goes through the phases at an accelerated rate and with reduced symptom severity.
 
On July 15, 1996, results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study on the common cold, which commenced at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation on October 3, 1994, were published. The study “Zinc Gluconate Lozenges for Treating the Common Cold” was completed and published in The Annals of Internal Medicine – Volume 125 Number 2. Using a 13.3 mg lozenge (almost half the strength of the lozenge used in the Dartmouth study), the result still showed a 42% reduction in the duration of common cold symptoms.

In addition to our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenges, we also market and distribute non-lozenge forms of our proprietary zinc gluconate formulation, (i) Cold-EEZE® cold remedy QuickMelts® are fast dissolving tablets that are taken orally, (ii) Cold-EEZE® cold remedy Oral Spray a liquid form of our zinc gluconate formulation that is sprayed in the mouth and (iii) Cold-EEZE® Gummies Multi-Symptom Relief Cold and Flu. The Cold-EEZE® cold remedy QuickMelts® product line is comprised of (i) Cold-EEZE® Daytime/Nighttime QuickMelts® (launched in Fiscal 2012), (ii) Cold-EEZE® Plus Immune Support + Energy QuickMelts® (launched in Fiscal 2013) and (iii) Cold-EEZE® Plus Multi-Symptom QuickMelts® (launched in Fiscal 2014). Cold-EEZE® Gummies Multi-Symptom Relief for Cold and Flu was launched in Fiscal 2016.
 
We also (i) manufacture, market and distribute cough drops and a Vitamin C supplement, (ii) perform contract manufacturing services of cough drop, dietary supplements, and other OTC cough-cold-flu products for third parties and (iii) market and distribute TK Supplements® products.
 
Our business is subject to federal and state health and safety laws and regulations. Our OTC health care and cold remedies are subject to regulations by various federal, state and local agencies, including the FDA. Additionally, Cold-EEZE® homeopathic cold remedy lozenges, QuickMelts®, Oral Spray, Gummies and Allergy caplets are subject to the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. See “Regulatory Matters” below for more information.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Royalty and Commission Agreements
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not currently own patents for our OTC health care and cold-remedy products. We maintain various trademarks for each of our products including Cold-EEZE®, QuickMelts®, Organix Rx Complete® and Organix Rx Defense®, ORXx Complete® and ORXx Defense®, TK Supplements®, Legendz XL®, Triple Edge XL® and Super ProstaFlow PlusTM.
 
We currently own various domestic and international patents covering certain product development initiatives principally developed under our Pharma subsidiary operations. To date, we have not realized any meaningful levels of revenues from such patents and we suspended in Fiscal 2009 any further commercialization efforts for various products under such patents.
 
TK Supplements® 
 
On June 30, 2015, we executed a Direct Response Production Agreement (“DRPA”) with Pacific Custom Video Productions Inc. (“PCV”) to produce a series of direct response television commercials for certain TK Supplements® products at a cost of $300,000 which was charged to operations in Fiscal 2016 due to changes in our future consumer engagement strategy which is expected to include both e-commerce (direct-to-consumer) and traditional retail store distribution. In addition, we agreed to pay to PCV a three percent performance incentive in the form of a royalty (aka commission) of net sales collected, as defined in the agreement, of certain TK Supplements® products marketed and promoted with PCV. For Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we charged to operations zero and $2,000 for performance incentive fees pursuant to terms of the DRPA. The DRPA was terminated effective February 2017.
 
Product Distribution and Customers
 
Our products are distributed through national chain, regional, specialty and local retail stores throughout the United States. We also provide contract manufacturing services to third parties. Revenues for Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $21.0 million, $20.6 million and $22.1 million, respectively. Two retail customers and one third party contract manufacturing customer accounted for 13.6%, 12.1% and 10.5%, respectively, of our Fiscal 2016 revenues. Two retail customers accounted for approximately 15.8% and 11.3%, respectively, of our Fiscal 2015 revenues. Three retail customers accounted for approximately 18.9%, 16.9% and 11.3%, respectively, of our Fiscal 2014 revenues. The loss of sales to any one or more of these large retail or third party contract manufacturing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition, unless we are able to increase revenue from other sources.

In addition, we have entered into multiple broker, distributor and representative agreements with third parties which provide for commission compensation based on sales performance.
 
Research and Development
 
We have historically invested significantly in research and development activities. Our research and development costs for Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $575,000, $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Our research and development initiatives have been principally focused on product line development and/or line extensions for OTC health care and cold remedy products under the Cold-EEZE® and TK Supplements® brands.
 
Currently, we fund our research and development costs with cash generated from operations. In addition to funding from operations, we may seek to raise capital through the issuance of securities or from other financing sources to support our research and development activities including new product technologies, applications, licensing, commercialization and other development opportunities, as well as acquisitions of new formulations, ingredients, applications and other products. Any such funding through the issuance of our equity securities would result in the dilution of current stockholder ownership. Should research or commercialization activity progress on certain formulations, resulting expenditures may require substantial financial support and may necessitate the consideration of alternative approaches such as licensing, joint venture or partnership arrangements that meet our long term goals and objectives. Ultimately, should internal working capital be insufficient and external funding methods or other business arrangements become unattainable, it could result in the deferral or loss of future growth and development opportunities.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations adopted for the health and safety of users of pharmaceutical and health care products. Our OTC homeopathic and health care products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies, including the FDA. In addition, our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy products are subject to the standards established by the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, and we may be subject to regulatory and legislative changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of manufacturing or distributing our products. Our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy products are considered a homeopathic drug and are exempt from pre-approval requirements and other, but not all, FDA requirements.
 
Many homeopathic drug and dietary supplement products, including Cold-EEZE® cold remedy and TK Supplements® products, are manufactured and distributed under FDA enforcement policies that provide requirements for marketing a homeopathic OTC drug or dietary supplement products without FDA approval. We believe we meet those requirements, which include registration of our manufacturing facility, listing of our product in the FDA’s product database, and packaging, labeling, and manufacturing homeopathic drugs and dietary supplements in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) regulations. In addition, the FDA is currently not enforcing the requirement for a laboratory determination of identity and strength of each active ingredient prior to release for distribution, although this exemption is pending FDA review and we cannot assure that the exemption will be permanently implemented. We also cannot assure that the FDA will agree with our determination of compliance. If the FDA disagrees, the FDA could, upon inspection, issue a notice of violations, referred to as a form FDA-483, or issue a Warning Letter, or both. If we fail to take timely corrective actions to the satisfaction of FDA, the agency can initiate legal actions, such as seizure and injunction, which could include a recall order or the entry of a consent decree, or both. In addition, we could be subject to monetary penalties and even criminal prosecution for egregious conduct. We believe that we are in compliance with all such laws, regulations, and standards currently in effect including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, as amended, from time to time, and the standards established under the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States.

Pre-clinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and licensing and/or acquisition of potential new products are also generally subject to federal and state regulation in the United States and other countries. Obtaining FDA and any other required regulatory approval for certain OTC products, or seeking the issuance of a final monograph from the FDA for certain OTC products, can require substantial resources and take several years. The length of this process depends on the type, complexity and novelty of the product and the nature of the disease or other indications to be treated. If we cannot obtain regulatory approval of, or final OTC monograph for, a new product(s) in a timely manner or if patents are not granted or are subsequently challenged, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Competition
 
We compete with other suppliers of OTC homeopathic and health care products. These suppliers range widely in size. Management believes that our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy lozenge products, which have been clinically proven in two double-blind studies to reduce the severity of common cold symptoms, offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the OTC cold remedy market. However, we have limited capital resources which limit our ability to further innovate and expand our Cold-EEZE® product offerings to compete in the competitive cough and cold category, where many other OTC product suppliers are larger and have significantly greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. Accordingly, we believe that it is in our best interests to sell our Cold-EEZE® Division to Mylan and to instead focus on and grow our PMI manufacturing business, ORXx and TK Supplements® product lines and to pursue other opportunities. We believe that our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, we employed 52 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, the majority of who were employed at our manufacturing facility in a production function. The remaining employees were involved in an executive, sales, marketing or administrative capacity. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are members of a union.
Suppliers; Raw Materials
 
We have derived our sales to date principally from our Cold-EEZE® cold remedy zinc gluconate products which are available in various forms – lozenges, oral spray, QuickMelts® and Gummies – and various flavors for purchase by consumers at retail stores. We also produce private label lozenge products for sale to certain retail customers. We manufacture our lozenge products at our Lebanon, Pennsylvania facility. The constituent raw materials and packaging used in the manufacture and presentation of these items have been procured from various sources with additional suppliers having been identified in the event that alternatives are required. While the absence of a current raw materials or packaging source may cause short term interruption, we expect that identified alternative sources would fill our needs in a short time and any transition period would be mitigated by adequate levels of finished product available for sale.
