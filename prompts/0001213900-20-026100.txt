ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to HL Acquisitions Corp.
 
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on February 23, 2018 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we have historically focused our search for a target business in the hydrocarbon logistics and processing industries.
 
All activity through June 30, 2020 relates to our formation, initial public offering (“IPO”), and activities in connection with completing an initial business combination.
 
We maintain a website located at hlacquisitions.com. Our corporate filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statements and reports filed by our officers and directors under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and any amendments to those filings, are available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend for information contained in our website to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Company History
 
In March 2018, we issued an aggregate of 1,221,875 ordinary shares (“Sponsors’ Shares”) to Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC, an affiliate of Jeffrey E. Schwarz, our Chief Executive Officer, for aggregate consideration of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.02 per share, in connection with our organization. Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC then subsequently transferred certain of the Sponsors’ Shares to our other initial shareholders for the same consideration originally paid for such shares. In June 2018, we effected a stock dividend of approximately 0.18 shares for each outstanding share, resulting in our initial shareholders holding an aggregate of 1,437,500 Sponsors’ Shares. The Sponsors’ Shares included an aggregate of 187,500 shares that were subject to forfeiture if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full in our IPO.
 
We also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”) 88,235 ordinary shares, which we refer to as “Representative Shares” and sold a unit purchase option to purchase up to 250,000 units to designees of EBC for a purchase price of $100. The unit purchase option is exercisable at $10.00 per unit (for an aggregate exercise price of $2,500,000), beginning on the later of the consummation of our initial business combination or June 27, 2019. The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires on June 27, 2023.

On July 2, 2018, we consummated our IPO of 5,500,000 units, including 500,000 units which were subject to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters of the IPO, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share, one right, and one redeemable warrant. Each right is exchangeable for one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Each warrant will become exercisable for one ordinary share, with an exercise price of $11.50 per share, on the completion of an initial business combination and will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of 2,375,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $2,375,000. The warrants were purchased by certain of our initial shareholders pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the IPO except that the warrants issued in the private placement: (i) are not redeemable by us and (ii) are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. Additionally, the purchasers of the private placement warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of HL’s initial business combination.
 
At the consummation of the IPO, the underwriters informed us that they would not be exercising the remaining portion of the overallotment option. As a result, our initial shareholders forfeited an aggregate of 62,500 ordinary shares.
 
We paid a total of $1,375,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions at the closing of the IPO and $504,265 for other costs and expenses related to our formation and the IPO. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us from the IPO and simultaneous private placement were $55,495,735. Of these amounts, $55,000,000 was deposited into a trust account established in connection with the IPO, and the balance became available to be used to provide for business, legal, and accounting due diligence on prospective target businesses and continuing general and administrative expenses. We may withdraw from the trust account interest earned on the funds held therein necessary to pay our income taxes, if any. Other than for this exception, the funds in the trust account will not be released to us until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period as set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (“M&A”).
 
Our focus after the IPO has been to search for a target business. On December 17, 2019, we entered into Sale and Purchase Agreement (“Sale and Purchase Agreement”) by and among us, Chi Energie (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (“Chi”) and Sila Energy Holding Limited, the sole shareholder of Chi (“Seller”). Pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Seller agreed to sell us all of the outstanding equity interests of Chi in exchange for our ordinary shares and warrants. On March 30, 2020, we and the Seller agreed to mutually terminate the Sale and Purchase Agreement. In connection with the termination, each party released the other from all claims relating to the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The parties determined to terminate the Sale and Purchase Agreement due to extraordinary market conditions surrounding the industry in which Chi was intending to operate.

On June 6, 2020, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (“Business Combination Agreement”) with Fusion Welcome – Fuel, S.A., a public limited company domiciled in Portugal, sociedade anónima (“Fusion Fuel”), Dolya Holdco 3 Limited, a private limited company domiciled in Ireland (now known as Fusion Fuel Green Limited, “Parent”), Fusion Fuel Atlantic Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the shareholders of Fusion Fuel (“Fusion Fuel Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) with the Company being the surviving entity of the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, followed immediately by (ii) the acquisition by Parent of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fusion Fuel (the “Share Exchange”, and together with the Merger, the “Transactions”). Upon consummation of the Transactions, Fusion Fuel Shareholders will be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of an aggregate of 2,125,000 Class B ordinary shares of Parent (“Class B Ordinary Shares”) and warrants (“Parent Warrants”) to purchase an aggregate of 2,125,000 Class A Ordinary Shares. In addition, Fusion Fuel Shareholders will have the right to receive a pro rata portion of up to an aggregate of 1,137,000 Class A Ordinary Shares and Parent Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,137,000 Class A Ordinary Shares upon the signing of agreements for the production and supply by Fusion Fuel or its affiliates of green hydrogen to certain purchasers (or, in the case of the first of such agreements, certain milestones with respect to performance under the agreement) prior to June 30, 2022. The Transactions will be consummated subject to the deliverables and provisions as further described in the Business Combination Agreement.
 
On August 25, 2020, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (“Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which the Business Combination Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety to, among other things: (i) provide a waiver by us to allow Fusion Fuel to amend its articles of association in order to create and issue a new class of shares (“Fusion Fuel’s Class A Shares”), (ii) provide that the contingent consideration, if issuable pursuant to the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, will be issued to holders of Fusion Fuel’s Class A Shares rather than holders of Fusion Fuel’s ordinary shares, and to make other related changes, (iii) to remove the financing condition in the earnout and reallocate the contingent consideration earnable among the remaining earnout conditions, (iv) remove the condition to closing that we have at least €22,800,000 in cash, net of disbursements to our public shareholders who elect to have their ordinary shares converted to cash and certain agreed expenses, (v) add a condition to closing that Parent receive an aggregate of no less than $25,122,500 in escrow pursuant to the subscription agreements entered into with certain accredited investors in connection with the private placement, described below, and (vi) provide that Parent shall be required to adopt an incentive equity plan and file a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to such plan within 6 months of the closing and not prior to closing.
 
In connection with the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, effective as of August 25, 2020, Parent entered into subscription agreements with 34 accredited investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which Parent will, immediately following the consummation of the Transactions, issue an aggregate of 2,450,000 Parent Class A Ordinary Shares to the Investors at a price of $10.25 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $25,122,500 (the “Private Placement”). The closing of the subscription agreements is conditioned upon (i) our receipt of shareholder approval of the issuance of the Parent Class A Ordinary Shares in the Private Placement pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), (ii) the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) the listing of the Parent Class A Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq. Each Investor’s subscription amount has been placed into escrow pending the closing of the Transactions. The Investors may not cancel, terminate, or revoke the subscription agreements and will only have a right to a return of their subscription amount in the event that any of the foregoing conditions are not satisfied. Upon the closing of the subscription agreements, Parent will pay aggregate commissions and fees of approximately $837,000 with respect to the sale of securities thereunder.

Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt, or a combination of these in effecting a business combination.
 
If we pay for our initial business combination using equity or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense and potential loss of voting control, among others. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. 
 
We will have until October 2, 2020 to consummate our initial business combination, unless such time period is extended by our shareholders, as provided in the M&A. On September 4, 2020, we filed a preliminary proxy statement to seek shareholder approval to extend our liquidation date from October 2, 2020 to January 2, 2021. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance.
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares they may purchase or the price they may pay. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
We will notify shareholders of such material purchases or arrangements that would affect the vote on an initial business combination, if any, by press release, filing a Form 8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement.

Conversion Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their ordinary shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. As of June 30, 2020, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.56 per public share. 
 
Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to this offering or purchased by them in this offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered a share certificate in connection with an election of conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, the holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). In the event that the proposed business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
Our M&A provides that we will have only until October 2, 2020 to complete our initial business combination (unless such time period is extended by our shareholders, as provided in our M&A). On September 4, 2020, we filed a preliminary proxy statement to seek shareholder approval to extend our liquidation date from October 2, 2020 to January 2, 2021.
 
If we do not complete a business combination by the required time period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, convert 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such conversion, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under British Virgin Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. This redemption of public shares from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our M&A and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Business Companies Act, 2004 of the British Virgin Islands (“BVI Companies Act”).

Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where we have our principal place of business, and taking any other steps the liquidator considers appropriate to identify our creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as our affairs are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.
 
Our initial shareholders, which include HL Acquisitions Holdings LLC, Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC, and the Jeffrey Schwarz Children’s Trust (our “Sponsors”), officers, and directors, have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their initial shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the required time period. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by such date.
 
Our executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our M&A that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by October 2, 2020, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon the consummation of, the Transactions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to a number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the required time period. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the British Virgin Islands court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.56. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.56. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, MCP V — Bushwick LLC has contractually agreed pursuant to a written agreement with us that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. We believe MCP V — Bushwick LLC has sufficient net worth to satisfy its indemnity obligation should it arise, however we cannot assure you it will have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy such obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by MCP V — Bushwick LLC specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, we cannot assure you that the per-share distribution from the trust account, if we liquidate the trust account because we have not completed a business combination within the required time period, will not be less than $10.00.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and MCP V — Bushwick LLC asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against MCP V — Bushwick LLC to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf to enforce these indemnification obligations, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.

If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act 2003, of the British Virgin Islands (“Insolvency Act”) (i.e., (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under Section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands court in favor of a creditor of ours is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of our liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, a payment made as “unfair preferences” or a “transaction at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to a British Virgin Islands courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.
 
Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them. Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our M&A prior to the consummation of an initial business combination or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights and followed the procedures described above and as detailed in the applicable proxy or tender offer materials.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination. In addition, the number of our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
