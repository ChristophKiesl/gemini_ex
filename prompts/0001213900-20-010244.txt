Industry Overview
 
Over the years, governments and the automobile manufacturing industry have reached a consensus on the importance of diversifying the automobile industry and utilizing various energy resources. China is one of the world’s largest automobile markets. China has relatively scarce fuel reserves but rich natural resources of electric power. As a result, the Chinese government has been implementing industrial policies of supporting new energy vehicles. The diversified market with the coexistence of traditional fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and pure electric vehicles has been initially formed. We believe China is the most prospective market for pure electric vehicles. According to a government forecast, China’s new energy vehicle sales are projected to grow to 2.1 million units in 2020, and its penetration is expected to reach 7% by 2020. We also believe that in the global automobile industry, there is great development space for the Chinese electric vehicle and core parts industry in the future.
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, was first found in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the global economy and many industries, including the automobile and parts industry. However, as the outbreak in China has been gradually managed under control, the automobile and parts industry has also begun to resume productions. Stimulated by the various preferential policies of the Chinese government to promote economic development, we believe the automobile and its parts industry will return onto the track for the next development.
 
As one of the pioneers in China’s electric vehicle industry, Kandi has spent years in the innovation of the new energy vehicle technology research and development, production layout and market promotion mode, Kandi has successfully taken its position in China’s electric vehicle industry, especially in the areas of the production and manufacturing of electric vehicles and core parts.
 
Competitive Landscape
 
In general, our EV business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.
 
In terms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers, many of the conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers are much larger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than the electric vehicle manufacturers. However, the conventional fuel automobiles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution and energy scarcity, which in turn provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV industry in China.
 
On March 31, 2020, in order to promote automobile consumption, the executive meeting of the State Council decided to extend two preferential policies of new energy vehicle purchase subsidy and vehicle purchase tax exemption for another two years, which were originally due at the end 2020. The Chinese government has released various national policies to promote the high-quality development of the electric vehicle industry with goals to facilitate the transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry, to improve the comprehensive competitiveness of the electric vehicle industry, to support the electric vehicle and its core parts industry, to accelerate the resumption of production, and to promote the automobile consumption to cope with the impact of COVID-19 on the national economy.
 
Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy
 
Local governments in China are pushing for new electric vehicle adoption with strong policy support, due to worsening air pollution and concerns about petroleum resource dependence. As one of the beneficiaries of the new energy vehicle industry take-off, Kandi has become one of the front runners in China’s electric vehicle industry, given its technology innovation with integrated solutions and operation experience.
 
Our business strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations in the Car- Share Program and the Affiliate Company’s direct sales channel. We also provide EV products to end users through our distributors. We anticipate that our pure EV product business in China, through the operations of the Affiliate Company and with the support of new Chinese government policies (including the Double Credit System Policy), will continue to develop and grow in the future. China promulgated the Double Credit System Policy in 2017, which assesses carmakers in terms of both fuel consumption and new energy vehicle production. We can amass credits by producing gasoline vehicles with less emissions than the country’s standards or by producing electric cars, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles.

Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability, and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution to these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the most popular public transportation options in China. They form the main artery of urban public transportation but such system is lack of capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportation system can be improved with the ORSS program.
 
In order to further improve the Car- Share Program, we united other operators in more than 10 cities to form of a five-year 300,000 units online ride-sharing service alliance at the beginning of 2019. As one of the most active practitioners of sharing economy model in China nowadays, this innovative business model provides an excellent solution to EV sharing. The character of this program is that all the cars casted to the online platform by the alliance use the changing-battery-model. The changing battery model solves the problems including high price of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potential pollution problem and so on. Furthermore this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, which prolongs the usage life of the battery and truly realize green energy efficiency. We have reason to believe that this upgrade to ORSS program from MPT advocated and practiced by Kandi will become the benchmark of urban car-share and play a significant role in the development of China’s urban travel ecosphere.
 
SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”) is a Dallas-based sales company with nationwide sales channels in the U.S that is primarily engaged in the wholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from off-road vehicle parts wholesale and retail. It has a seasoned management team and a distribution force averaging over ten years of sales experience. To gain access to and promote electric vehicle products to the U.S. market, on July 1, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of SC Autosports. Through more than one year’s preparation, SC Autosports is to begin to sell Kandi’s electric vehicles in the U.S. market this year.
 
On March 21, 2019, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd. (“Kandi Vehicles”) signed an Equity Transfer Agreement with Geely Technologies Group Co., Ltd. (“Geely”) to transfer certain equity interests in the Kandi Electric Vehicles Group Co., Ltd. (the “Affiliate Company”, formerly defined as the “JV Company”) to Geely. As a result of the completion of the equity transfer on September 29, 2019, Kandi Vehicles now owns 22% and Geely and its affiliates own 78% of the equity interests of the Affiliate Company. In October 2019, the Affiliate Company changed name to Fengsheng Automotive Technology Group Co., Ltd.. Approved by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Affiliate Company is a new energy vehicle design, development and production vehicle manufacturer.
 
Benefiting from the technical support of Geely, the Affiliate Company now has the ability to manage the whole life cycle of the new energy vehicle sale process, including new energy vehicle market business analysis, new energy vehicle product development, sample vehicle delivery verification, production and after-sales maintenance. At the same time, the Affiliate Company will have competitive advantages in the devemopment of intelligent internet connection and autonomous vehicles.
 
The Affiliate Company has transitioned from a traditional vehicle company to an intelligent vehicle company. It operated an independently developed vehicle remote upgrade platform, a vehicle networking and vehicle terminal, and a vehicle monitoring platform, which allow it to manage the vehicle operation data, improve, optimize and expand the platform functions (including vehicle monitoring, autonomous, remote control, and vehicle physical examination); improve vehicle operation, management efficiency and enhance the user experience by connecting the user with the vehicle and pile.
 
On April 10, 2020, the Affiliate Company held an online brand conference to launch its “Maple Leaf Brand” products. Maple Leaf Brand is a new energy brand established as a result of the integration of Huapu’s manufacture license and Kandi’s assets. The products of this brand mainly compete with the new forces of domestic cars. With the Maple 30X motor’s maximum output of 70kw, the driving range on a full charge is up to 306 km or 190 miles. The model comes with express charging and standard charging options. Express charging enables the vehicle to be charged to 80% in about 30 minutes. A home plug-in charging feature is also available. The national pre-sale price after subsidy starts at RMB 68,800 (approximately USD $9,778) and goes up to RMB79,800 (approximately$11,342) for the premium package. Maple 30X is the first Maple model released this year. There are two more models planning to be launched later this year: a pure SUV targeting “millennial” families and an MPV model.
