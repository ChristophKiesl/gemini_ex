ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on August 7, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a “business combination”). To date, Allegro’s efforts have been limited to organizational activities, completion of its initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations.
 
Initial Public Offering
 
Prior our initial public offering, we issued to Eric Rosenfeld, our Chief Executive Officer, an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of common stock in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.01 per share. Mr. Rosenfeld then transferred all of the shares to two trusts for the benefit of his immediate family members, and subsequently, a portion of such shares was transferred to the other initial stockholders in exchange for $0.01 per share. In April 2018, the initial stockholders contributed to our capital an aggregate of 575,000 shares for no additional consideration, leaving them with an aggregate of 3,737,500 shares of common stock.
 
On July 6, 2018, we closed our initial public offering of 14,950,000 units, including 1,950,000 units that were issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, one right, and one warrant. The initial public offering generated gross proceeds of $149,500,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 372,500 private placement units at a price of $10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of $3,725,000. The private placement units were purchased by the initial stockholders, Cantor, and Chardan.
 
Following the closing of the initial public offering on July 6, 2018, an amount of $149,500,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units and private placement units was placed in the trust account.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
On November 8, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Allegro Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, TGIF Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Holdings”), TGIF Midco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Midco”), and Rohit Manocha, solely in his capacity as the initial representative of the equityholders of Holdings and Midco. 
 
On March 26, 2020, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (“Charter”) to extend the time by which the Company had to complete an initial business combination from March 31, 2020 to April 30, 2020. However, in light of the termination of the Merger Agreement and due to extraordinary market conditions, the Company determined on March 31, 2020 that it would not so amend its Charter.
 
On March 31, 2020, the Company and Holdings mutually determined, due to extraordinary market conditions and the failure to meet necessary closing conditions, to terminate the Merger Agreement.
 
Dissolution of Trust Account; Delisting and Deregistration of Securities
 
Pursuant to the Charter, on March 31, 2020, the Company began the process of liquidating and distributing to its public stockholders their pro rata portion of the funds contained in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the amounts on deposit, less amounts that may be released to the Company to pay franchise and income taxes and up to $100,000 of interest which may be released to the Company to pay dissolution expenses. On April 21, 2020, all of the public shares were redeemed at a per share redemption price of $10.30. As of December 31, 2020, we have an aggregate of $61,268 of restricted cash in connection with the unused portion of our dissolution allowance and allowance for taxes. We expect to distribute such amount, pro rata, to our former public stockholders.
 
An aggregate of approximately $781,700 of loans made by the initial stockholders to the Company in connection with extensions of time to complete an initial business will not be repaid and will be forgiven if we are unable to consummate a business combination and determine to liquidate and dissolve.
 
The initial stockholders waived their redemption rights with respect to the common stock issued prior to the Company’s initial public offering and the common stock underlying the Private Units. Accordingly, such initial stockholders did not participate in the redemption and an aggregate of 4,110,000 shares of common stock remain outstanding. Additionally, the Company’s rights and warrants remain outstanding.
 
On April 20, 2020, Nasdaq filed a Form 25 to delist and deregister the units, common stock, rights, and warrants. Such securities were delisted from Nasdaq as of April 30, 2020 and deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act as of July 9, 2020.
