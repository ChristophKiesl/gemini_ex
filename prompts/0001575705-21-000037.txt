Corporate Background and Business Overview
 
Puget Technologies, Inc. (the “Registrant”) is a publicly held corporation incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 17, 2010, and, since May 25, 2012, when its registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act was declared effective by the Commission, has been subject to reporting requirements pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. It was initially organized to engage in the distribution of luxury wool bedding products produced in Germany. Its principal executive offices, originally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, are currently located at 1200 North Federal Highway, Suite 200-A; Boca Raton, Florida 33432. Its telephone number is 1 (561) 210 8535. Its website address is https://www.pugettechnologies.com/ and copies of all principal corporate documents and filings with the Commission are available at such website.
 
The Registrant has never filed for bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings nor, since the date of the last annual report on Form 10-K filed (for the fiscal year 2014), has it been involved in any reclassification, merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. From 2015 until July of 2020, the Registrant was inactive as its prior management resigned leaving it indebted and without business operations. Consequently, during such period it lacked the funds required to comply with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Since July of 2020, with the assistance of its Parent (“a person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified”, Rule 405 of Commission Regulation C) and strategic consultant, Qest Consulting Group, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Qest”), the Registrant has eliminated most of its debt and resumed filing of reports to the Commission. Most of the Registrant’s efforts during the period from 2015 until July of 2020 involved first, repudiation of the series of 8% convertible notes issued by prior management under terms which current management considered toxic (the “Convertible Notes”) but, after the Registrant and its management were sued by two of the noteholders in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 15-cv-08860 entitled Adar Bays LLC v Puget Technologies Inc. and Hermann Burckhardt and Case No. 15-cv-09542 entitled Union Capital LLC v Puget Technologies Inc. and Herman Burckhardt), lacking adequate funds to defend such actions the Registrant entered into settlement agreements and until July of 2020, was active only in conjunction with seeking to discharge such liabilities. As a material subsequent event, the 8% Convertible Notes payable have been either converted, paid or otherwise resolved, consequently, the Registrant is no longer indebted under the terms of any of the aforementioned notes nor is there is any outstanding or threatened related litigation.
 
On October 22, 2020, the Registrant entered into a retainer and consulting agreement with Qest (the “Qest Agreement”) and in conjunction therewith, in order to induce Qest to defer the cash portion of its compensation, the Registrant’s officers and directors (who are also the principal stockholders, officers and directors of Qest), contributed all of their securities in the Registrant, including rights to compensation in the form of securities, to Qest. The terms of the Qest Agreement are summarized in Item 7 hereof, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence”). In conjunction with its role under the Qest Agreement, Qest advanced the Registrant funds used to pay for auditing and legal fees in conjunction with this annual report, to pay balances due to the Registrant’s transfer agent and to settle remaining obligations under the Convertible Notes. Qest is also temporarily providing the Registrant with office space, utilities and the use of its personnel.

During October of 2020, the Registrant, at the suggestion of Qest, decided to implement a new business model as a holding company operating through subsidiaries in four different albeit related areas. These include acquisition of promising operating companies but also assisting promising operating companies to attain independent public company status. In order to properly implement the following described business plan, the Registrant’s current management has been directed to recruit conduct a nationwide search for new members of its Board of Directors and replacement officers prior to the next scheduled annual meeting of its stockholders currently anticipated for February of 2022. As disclosed in a current report filed by the Registrant with the Commission on January 15, 2021, Qest has recommended that the Registrant’s Board of Directors be expanded to nine or more members, at least three of whom should be independent so that audit, nominating and compensation committees could be implemented as envisioned by the Registrant’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. In terms of experience, Qest has recommended that the new board of directors continue to employ persons with investment banking and accounting experience but also with experience with mutual funds, the insurance industry, innovative technologies (e.g., alternative energy), the medical industry, intellectual property and regulatory compliance. In order to recruit qualified personnel, the Registrant will recommend that its stockholders ratify qualified and non-qualified stock option plans at its next annual meeting and has authorized a limited offering of its securities on reliance on Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, the proceeds of which will be used for, among other things, obtaining officers and directors liability insurance, discharging all remaining corporate debt, primarily owed to Qest (approximately $100,000 involving expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business), payment of legal and auditing expenses required to bring and maintain the Registrant current with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and provide initial working capital. Significant additional funding will be required in order to implement the Registrant’s business plan summarized below and it is expected that Qest will assist the Registrant in that regard since it is anticipated that, although the Registrant’s current officers and directors would not continue in their current roles with the Registrant following the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, they would continue to be indirectly involved as Qest is expected to remain as the Registrant’s strategic consultant for at least the next three years.
 
The four diverse areas in which the Registrant intends to concentrate through subsidiaries are, in the order in which it is anticipated projects will be undertaken, as follows:
 

1. | Through traditional acquisition of development stage operating companies that the Registrant’s Board of Directors determines provide positive business opportunities. In that regard, the Registrant is considering the acquisition of a consolidated company currently engaged in the operation of behavioral health clinics in the State of Florida and is considering a joint venture in the solar energy industry involving proprietary nanotechnologies with current members of its Board of Advisors; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Through acquisition of promising privately held operating companies that eventually want to attain independent publicly traded status after a an incubation period as subsidiaries of the Registrant, during which time they would control most of their own operations but learn the intricacies of being regulated under state and federal securities regulation. The Registrant would control all legal and accounting operations and seek to generate savings and synergy by coordinating activities (e.g., purchases, marketing, warehousing, etc., among its subsidiaries);
3. | Through organization and operation of a Business Development Company under the limited exemptive provisions of Sections 54(a) through 65 of the Investment Company Act; and 
4. | By formation of specialty acquisition vehicles for operating companies that desire to become public. 

 
In addition to the foregoing, given the experience that the Registrant’s president has with tax related benefits of doing business in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Registrant intends to explore opportunities for potential subsidiaries there.
 
The Registrant’s Proposed Program for Consolidated Operating Subsidiaries
 
The Registrant proposes to seek out business opportunities its management deems promising and which its Board of Directors feels it can supervise and develop. For illustrative purposes only, initially, these may involve ownership and operation of behavioral health clinics in the State of Florida. Furthermore, the Registrant has formed a Board of Advisors whose members have discussed the possibility of entering into a joint venture or other business structure with the Registrant in the solar energy industry involving proprietary nanotechnologies. None of such projects are close to fruition but the Registrant believes that with the assistance of its Advisory Board, its strategic consultant, Qest, and the efforts of its officers, it can find projects of interest that can be developed into diverse lines of business, with the Registrant itself serving as a resource center for its diverse subsidiaries, providing savings in operational expenditures based on size and coordinated efforts and generating synergy among its corporate family.

The Registrant’s Proposed Program for Operating Incubator Subsidiaries
 
The Registrant proposes a program for promising privately held operating companies that eventually want to attain independent publicly traded status but realize that subjection to regulation under federal and state securities laws as well involvement with investors and the investment banking community has as many pitfalls as benefits and thus justify a period of supervised mentoring. The Registrant proposes to acquire such companies through reorganizations complying with the tax free exchange provisions of Section 368 of the Code but to assure their owners that for the most part, they will be able to continue to grow and manage their businesses on their own through the grant of a proxy to vote such subsidiary’s capital stock subject to the following conditions: the Registrant will have the right to designate one member of the subsidiary’s board of directors, the Registrant will control, with the advice and input of the subsidiary’s management, the subsidiary’s legal and auditing matters, and the subsidiary will contribute along with all other subsidiaries, a proportional share of its net-after tax profits to the Registrant for payment of administrative and overhead expenses. After at least a two-and-a-half year period as a subsidiary of the Registrant during which time the subsidiary’s management would learn the intricacies of being regulated under state and federal securities regulation, the subsidiary’s original stockholders or their successor’s in interest would, if they so elect, have the right to spin out as independent public companies. That would be accomplished by having 15% of their common stock transferred as a stock dividend to the Registrant’s stockholders, registered for such transfer with the Commission pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act, making them reporting companies with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Ten percent of the subsidiary’s securities would be temporarily retained by the Registrant and either sold off or conveyed to the subsidiary operating as a Small Business Development Company, and the rest would be returned to the operating subsidiary’s original stockholders in exchange for 75% of the Registrant’s securities issued to acquire the operating subsidiary. To the extent the subsidiary’s original stockholders had disposed of the Registrant stock received in the reorganization, they would have to either reacquire it for tender to the Registrant, or forfeit their spinout options. In the event the original stockholders could not or did not elect to exercise their spinout rights, the Registrant would elect to either retain the operating subsidiary as wholly owned, or, spin it out in whole or in part to its stockholders through a registered dividend distribution procedure similar to the one described above anyway.
Business Development Companies
 
Assuming success in implanting the initial two stages of its proposed plan of operation, the Registrant expects that it would next move on to the organization and operation of a business development company which it believes would generate significant synergy with the operating subsidiaries program described above. For example, the Registrant must not accumulate investment securities or else it will be subject to regulation as an investment company. By having a business development company subsidiary, it can transfer the balance of the securities remaining when it spins off a subsidiary to the business development company eliminating such risk as well as helping capitalize the business development company.
 
It is anticipated that such project would not be initiated prior to 2023. The following summary information with regard to business development companies was excerpted from a post in Investopedia encaptioned “Business Development Company (business development company):
 
The United States Congress created business development companies in 1980 to fuel job growth and assist emerging United States businesses in raising funds. Business development companies are closely involved in providing advice about the operations of their portfolio companies. Many business development companies make investments in private companies and sometimes in small public firms that have low trading volumes. They provide permanent capital to these businesses by taking advantage of a wide variety of sources, such as equity, debt, and hybrid financial instruments.
 
A business development company is a type of closed-end fund that makes investments in developing and financially distressed firms. Many business development companies are publicly traded and are open to retail investors. Business development companies offer investors high dividend yields and some capital appreciation potential. Business development companies’ heavy use of leverage and targeting of small or distressed companies makes them relatively high-risk investments.
 
To qualify as a business development company, a company must be a domestic company whose class of securities is registered with the Commission in compliance with Section 54 of the Investment Company Act pursuant to the more limited regulatory provisions of Sections 54(a) through 65 thereof. The business development company must invest at least 70% of its assets in private or public United States firms with market values of less than US$250 million. Such companies are often young businesses, seeking financing, or firms that are suffering or emerging from financial difficulties. Also, the business development company must provide managerial assistance to the companies in its portfolio.

If business development companies sound similar to venture capital funds, they are. However, there are some key differences. One relates to the nature of the investors each seeks. Venture capital funds are available mostly to large institutions and wealthy individuals through Limited Offerings. In contrast, business development companies allow smaller, non- accredited investors to invest in them, and by extension, in small growth companies.
 
Venture capital funds keep a limited number of investors and must meet certain asset-related tests to avoid being classified as regulated investment companies. Business development company shares, on the other hand, are typically traded on stock exchanges and are constantly available as investments for the public. Business development companies that decline to list on an exchange are still required to follow the same regulations as listed business development companies. Less stringent provisions for the amount of borrowing, related-party transactions, and equity-based compensation make the business development company an appealing form of incorporation to venture capitalists who were previously unwilling to assume the burdensome regulation of an investment company.
 
Business development companies provide investors with exposure to debt and equity investments in predominantly private companies—typically closed to investments. Because business development companies are regulated investment companies, they must distribute over 90% of their profits to shareholders. That regulated investment company status, though, means they don’t pay corporate income tax on profits before they distribute them to shareholders. The result is above-average dividend yields. According to “business development companyInvestor.com,” as of May 2019, the ten highest-yielding business development companies were posting anywhere from 10.82% to 14.04%.
 
Investors receiving dividends will pay taxes on them at their tax rate for ordinary income. Also, business development company investments may diversify an investor’s portfolio with securities that can display substantially different returns from stocks and bonds. Of course, the fact that they trade on public exchanges gives them a fair amount of liquidity and transparency.
 
Although a business development company itself is liquid, many of its holdings are not. The portfolio holdings are primarily private firms or small, thinly-traded public companies. Because most business development company holdings are typically invested in illiquid securities, a business development company’s portfolio has subjective fair-value estimates and may experience sudden and quick losses. These losses can be magnified because business development companies often employ leverage—that is, they borrow the money they invest or loan to their target companies. Leverage can improve the rate of return on investment, but it can also cause cash-flow problems if the leveraged asset declines in value.
 
The business development company-invested target companies typically have no track records or troubling track records. There is always the chance they could go under or default on a loan. A rise in interest rates—making it more expensive to borrow funds—can impede a business development company’s profit margins as well. In short, business development companies invest aggressively in companies that offer both incomes now and capital appreciation later; as such, they register somewhat high on the risk scale.
 
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPAC”)
 
Subsequent to organization of a business development company subsidiary, assuming success in doing so, the Registrant plans to organize a sequential series special purpose acquisition companies which its current management and Qest believe will complement the other three proposed segments of its proposed business plans providing an additional, more independent option for more seasoned companies that desire to attain publicly traded status. As in the foregoing case, the Registrant would either distribute securities it retains in SPACs it organizes to its shareholders in the form of stock dividends, or distribute them to its business development company subsidiary avoiding direct regulation as an investment company.

A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), is a “blank check” shell corporation designed to take companies public without going through the traditional IPO process. SPACs allow retail investors to invest in private equity type transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. According to the Commission, a SPAC is created specifically to pool funds in order to finance a merger or acquisition opportunity within a set timeframe. The opportunity usually has yet to be identified. In the United States, the SPAC public offering structure is governed by the Commission. A public offering for a SPAC is typically filed with the Commission under an S-1 registration statement (or an F-1 for a foreign private issuer) and is classified by the Commission under SIC code 6770 - Blank Checks. Full disclosure of the SPAC structure, target industries or geographic regions, management team biographies, share ownership, potential conflicts of interest and risk factors are standard topics included in the S-1 registration statement. It is believed that the Commission has studied SPACs to determine whether they require special regulations to ensure that these vehicles are not abused like blind pool trusts and blank-check corporations have been over the years. Many believe that SPACs do have corporate governance mechanisms in place to protect shareholders. SPACs listed on the American Stock Exchange are required to be Sarbanes-Oxley compliant at the time of the offering including such mandatory requirements as a majority of the board of directors being independent and audit and compensation committees[1].
 
Caveat
 
The foregoing plans and business models are speculative, totally reliant on the experience of the Registrant’s management and independent consultants and contractor’s to be recruited and retained by the Registrant, and on market conditions beyond the Registrant’s control, and, on the Registrant’s ability to obtain significant additional financing, as to which there can be no assurances. In addition, the Registrant is likely to encounter significant competition in its quest for desirable acquisition candidates and thereafter, even if successful, in the operations of the acquired companies. Consequently, no assurances can be provided that the Registrant’s ambitious current business plans can or will be implemented as envisioned, or that even if implemented, they will prove successful.
 
Principal products or services and their markets
 
The Registrant at present has no products or services and thus no information is provided with respect to distribution methods of products or services; status of any publicly announced new product or service; sources and availability of raw materials and names of principal suppliers. Given that it has no customers at present, the Registrant is not dependence on one or a few major customers. The Registrant currently has no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. However, it is probable that as it implements its proposed business plans all of the foregoing topics will become relevant.
 
Need for any government approval of principal products or services
 
Given that the Registrant currently has no principal products or services, it currently has no need for any related government approvals. However, every aspect of its proposed business operations is replete with the possibility of government regulation and oversight. Every segment of its proposed operations will involve regulation by the Commission in conjunction with acquisitions in exchange for the Registrant’s securities, with respect to spinoffs and stock dividends, with respect to formation, funding, operation and divesting of special purpose acquisition vehicles and especially with respect to operation of the proposed business development company. In addition, every operating subsidiary will be subject to the full panoply of regulations of a federal, state and local level applicable to operating companies, with specialized regulation depending on the industries involved. Intellectual property regulation and regulation of international trade is likely to be of special importance. Thus, while the nature of regulation is impossible to accurately predict at this time, the consequences will assuredly involve significant legal and administrative expenses risks of litigation and penalties, and of delays that will affect the competiveness of the Registrant and its affiliates.

Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local)
 
Given that the Registrant currently has no principal products, services or operations, it is impossible to predict the costs, effects and impacts of compliance with federal state and local environmental regulations other than to acknowledge, as is the case in the preceding section, that it will assuredly involve significant legal and administrative expenses risks of litigation and penalties, and of delays that will affect the competiveness of the Registrant and its affiliates.
 
Number of total employees and number of full-time employees
 
Other than its two current officers and directors, the Registrant currently has no employees of any kind. However, as indicated above, the Registrant is actively seeking to recruit employees capable of implanting its proposed business plans, as well as of related independent contractors and other consultants. In the latter regard, pursuant to the Qest Agreement, Qest will be responsible for assembling and supervising teams of independent contractors to assist the Registrant in every aspect of its operations during the pendency of such agreement, thereby hopefully limiting the Registrant’s employment related expenses.
 
Competitive business conditions and the Registrant’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
While the Registrant knows of no other company currently combining the four different segments of its proposed business plan, many experienced and very well-funded companies are involved in each such segment in which the Registrant proposes to participate and, ironically, many of them, or of their nature, are companies with which the Registrant will need to establish relationships in order to succeed in its proposed lines of businesses. Competitors will include investment banking firms, venture capital firms, the consulting branches of major auditing and law firms. Additionally, given the nature of the competition, the Registrant will probably have to engage in riskier and less developed acquisition ventures with less seasoned companies and in each such case the acquired companies will probably also be faced with intense competition. While the Registrant will seek niche industries where competition is not as intensive, there is no assurances that it will initially be able to successfully compete at any level.
