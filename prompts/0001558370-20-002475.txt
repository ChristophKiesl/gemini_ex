 Item 1. Business
 Rubius Therapeutics is developing a new class of cellular medicines, called Red Cell Therapeutics™, or RCTs. Built upon the research and findings of Flagship Pioneering’s VentureLabs innovation team along with the discoveries of Professors Harvey Lodish and Hidde Ploegh of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT, we have developed the RED PLATFORM®, a versatile and proprietary cellular therapy platform, which enables us to engineer and culture cellular therapies that are designed to be selective, potent and ready‑to‑use. RCTs are engineered to express biotherapeutic proteins within or on the cell surface and are designed to activate the immune system to attack tumors in cancer and regulate the immune system for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. We believe that the RED PLATFORM could provide beneficial treatments for our lead indications, many of which have few, if any, effective treatments.
 We are developing RCT product candidates for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases based on two therapeutic modalities —potent cell‑cell interaction and tolerance induction.

 Cancer: We are developing RCTs to express combinations of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines on the cell surface to activate and expand different components of the immune system, which we believe will offer the following advantages:
 Broad immune stimulation via potent cell‑cell interaction: RCT product candidates are engineered to broadly activate the adaptive and innate immune systems through potent cell-cell interaction to attack and kill tumors, replicating how the immune system naturally functions. Because RCTs are restricted to the vasculature, these product candidates may have limited side effects as observed in our preclinical studies. We believe RCTs have the potential to have broad therapeutic application across a range of solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Our lead

oncology program is RTX-240, which expresses both 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP, a fusion of IL‑15 and IL‑15 receptor alpha. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application for RTX-240 has been allowed to proceed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we plan to announce when the first patient is dosed. 
 Antigen-specific immune activation via cell surface antigen presentation: We are also developing RCT product candidates to express a tumor-associated antigen, a co-stimulatory signal and a cytokine at the same time on the surface of the same cell. These cells are designed to induce a tumor-specific immune response by expanding antigen-specific T cells. RTX-321, our lead artificial antigen presenting cell program (aAPC), expresses an HPV peptide bound to MHC I, 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. We plan to file an IND for RTX-321 for the treatment of HPV 16-positive tumors by the end of 2020. We plan to follow RTX-321 with a range of programs that could target viral antigens, shared, or over-expressed cancer-associated antigens and personalized neoantigens.
 Autoimmune Diseases: We engineer RCTs to express specific autoimmune disease-associated antigens within the cell or on the cell surface to restore immune system function and retrain the body to no longer see these self-antigens as foreign. In addition, we believe our product candidates have the ability to express immune modulating cytokines, enzymes or inhibitory signals, which may have the potential to enhance the tolerogenic effects of RCTs. The resulting restoration or induction of immune tolerance may lead to more effective treatments—potentially even cures—for certain autoimmune diseases. Available therapies for autoimmune diseases have significant limitations because these therapies are required to be administered on a chronic, lifelong basis. Many treatments fail to provide adequate benefit to patients, and many patients’ diseases will eventually progress despite continued therapy. Furthermore, these existing treatments are associated with side effects that include opportunistic infections, lymphoma and, in some cases, severe and even fatal reactions. We believe RCTs can be designed to more specifically modulate complex counter‑regulatory immune responses and enable greater efficacy with lower toxicity, potentially providing treatments for a number of diseases with high unmet need. Specifically, RCTs may provide the following benefit to patients with autoimmune diseases:
 Induction of peripheral tolerance: Our preclinical data suggest that RBCs expressing surface-bound antigens may be capable of blocking immune responses to those antigens, potentially inducing tolerance (the ability to prevent responses without a need for ongoing immunotherapy). In preclinical studies in models of central nervous system inflammation and diabetes, we achieved successful modulation of immune responses by expressing antigens on RCTs. We believe our antigen-specific autoimmune RCT product candidates have the potential to be curative therapies for many autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes.
 Broad and Diverse Pipeline
 Rubius Therapeutics is advancing a broad pipeline of RCT™ product candidates. Our current programs are investigating applications across cancer and autoimmune diseases. The IND application for RTX-240, our lead oncology program, has been allowed to proceed by the FDA and we plan to announce when the first patient has been dosed. Additionally, we plan to file an IND for our first aAPC program, RTX-321, by year-end. 

 Definitions: aAPC—artificial antigen presenting cell; AML—acute myeloid leukemia; HPV+—Human papilloma virus positive; R/R —relapsed/refractory; FPI—first patient in.

 Until March 2020, we had been developing RTX-134 for the treatment of phenylketonuria, or PKU. We have discontinued the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial and have deprioritized development of RTX-134 and our other rare disease programs, to focus instead on the development of our oncology and autoimmunity pipeline. See “Business—Rare Diseases” for more information.
 Manufacturing 
 Recognizing the importance of controlling our own manufacturing capabilities to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, we acquired and began renovating a manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI, in July 2018. As of January 2020, this manufacturing facility is operational. We plan to provide cGMP supply for our upcoming RTX-240 and RTX-321 cancer clinical trials from this site, and have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities at this facility. We plan to stage additional investments at this site based on future supply needs. 
 Separately, in 2018, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with a CMO located in the United States to produce cGMP grade RTX‑134 for our initial clinical trial in PKU. We experienced multiple manufacturing challenges with this CMO that contributed to delays in the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial. Although we were able to manufacture clinical grade RTX-134 for the first time during the third quarter of 2019, continued challenges contributed to further clinical trial delays following the dosing of the first patient in January 2020. In March 2020, we decided to discontinue the RTX-134 Phase1b clinical trial and deprioritized RTX-134 and our other rare disease programs, to primarily focus on the development of our oncology and autoimmunity pipeline. 
 Seasoned Leadership Team
 Since we commenced operations in 2013, we have attracted a talented group of seasoned leaders to execute our strategy. Over the course of 2019 and early 2020, we further strengthened our leadership team by hiring Christina Coughlin, M.D., Ph.D., as Chief Medical Officer, Laurence Turka, M.D., as Chief Scientific Officer, Kris Elverum as Senior Vice President of Business Development and Strategy, Maiken Keson-Brookes as Chief Legal Officer and Greg Whitehead as Chief Quality Officer. Our leadership team has extensive experience in oncology, immunology, and cell therapy drug discovery and development. Patent Portfolio
 We have and continue to build a broad portfolio of patent applications, know how, trade secrets, and other intellectual property that covers both our platform technologies as well as product discoveries, the breadth and depth of which is a strategic asset that could provide us with competitive advantages. As of February 2020, we have 12 issued U.S. patents. Our lead product candidates – RTX-240, RTX-321 and RTX-224 – are covered by three varieties of issued U.S. patent claims: 1) composition of matter; 2) method of treatment; and 3) method of making. We have 32 patent families and more than 150 patent applications worldwide. 
 Utilizing RBCs to create cellular therapies
 RBCs are the most ubiquitous cells in the human body, constituting over 70% of the body’s cells and play a critical role in the delivery of oxygen to tissues. To constantly replenish this population of critical cells, the human body generates approximately 2.5 million RBCs every second. RBCs represent the first example of a transformative cellular therapy as physicians have been transfusing blood to patients since the early 1800s. Today, the focus around cellular therapies has largely been directed toward T cell and other lymphocyte‑based therapies. We believe that RBC‑based therapies will transform the cellular therapy landscape as they may represent the ideal cell type for the creation of versatile, well‑tolerated and ready‑to‑use cellular therapies. We believe such therapies could avoid many of the complications and risks often associated with earlier generation cellular therapies, including the emerging category of T cell-based therapies. These distinct characteristics of RBCs support their potential to serve as the foundation for a cellular therapy:

· | a well‑characterized and controllable biodistribution as RBCs are generally sequestered in the vasculature, spleen and liver.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  7
 


· | the established use of O negative blood as a universal source that can be administered to greater than 95% of people;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the presence of certain surface markers, such as CD47, on RBCs provide what are referred to as “don’t eat me” signals, preventing the immune system from clearing RBCs from circulation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | since RBCs are enucleated, they do not pose a risk of uncontrolled cell division or oncogenicity following an infusion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our proprietary RED PLATFORM
 We are developing a new, potentially transformative class of medicines that leverage the benefits of RBCs to provide cellular therapies to patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. As RBCs are enucleated, they have generally been considered simple oxygen delivery vehicles, rather than the backbone of a versatile cellular therapy platform. Past attempts at RBC‑based therapies, such as applying hypotonic loading or cell swelling to load an enzyme or protein into RBCs, have had limited therapeutic applications, proven difficult to scale and reduced the in vivo half‑life of the loaded RBCs.
 Our discoveries and innovations in genetic engineering and cell culture processes have made it possible to now use RBCs as a foundation for the creation and development of a new class of cellular therapies. By modifying only one of our initial manufacturing steps in which we add a gene or genes to encode biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface of RCTs, we are able to rapidly develop new RCTs designed to treat different diseases. This approach allows for the consistent generation of product candidates and a preclinical evaluation process that we believe has the potential to create a broad range of therapeutics in an efficient manner. Our uniform approach should also enable us to leverage common chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and toxicology data packages to shorten development timelines. While the focus of our RED PLATFORM is currently in cancer and autoimmune diseases, we believe the versatility of our platform can be applied to other therapeutic areas.
 The RED PLATFORM allows us to generate a wide variety of allogeneic, ready‑to‑use RCT product candidates with a universal and proprietary process through the following steps: (1) obtaining CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells from the blood of O negative donors; (2) genetic engineering of the cells to express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface of the RCTs; (3) exposing the cells to media, or nutrients, in a bioreactor to promote further expansion and differentiation until the nucleus is ejected, resulting in a mature reticulocyte that has the characteristics of a normal red blood cell with the biotherapeutic protein(s) of interest added inside or on the cell surface; and (4) formulating, characterizing and storing doses of the resulting RCT product candidate for later administration to patients.


 
  8
 

 A significant advantage of differentiating the cells into reticulocytes is the ability to separate the genetic modification from the final RCT product candidate through the biological process of enucleation, a property unique to reticulocytes. Enucleation involves the ejection of the nucleus from the cell, and with it, all the DNA it contains, leaving behind an RCT that expresses the protein or proteins that confer the intended therapeutic benefit. We believe this absence of genetic material may reduce the safety risks associated with RCTs as compared with current cellular therapies.
 Limitations of previous and current cellular therapies
 The field of tissue, cell and regenerative therapy has a long history, starting with blood transfusions in the early 1800s, followed by organ and bone marrow transplants in the middle of the 20th century and later the approval of cellular therapy products ranging from epidermal transplantation for wound care to mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of graft versus host disease and dendritic cells for the treatment of prostate cancer.
 Most recently, several biotechnology companies and academic groups have demonstrated that a type of regenerative cell therapy known as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR‑Ts, where a patient’s own T cells are genetically engineered to recognize and attack specific cancer cells, are capable of powerful and sometimes curative therapeutic effects. In addition, some groups are studying the adoptive transfer and activation of T cell receptor, or TCR, -engineered T cells, and natural killer cells, or NK cells, for treatment of solid and hematologic cancers, while others are attempting to expand and engineer regulatory T cells ex vivo for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
 A range of issues have historically limited the use of cellular therapies:

· | Limited therapeutic application: Given the specialized nature of these prior cellular therapies, they have been designed for specific indications and against specific antigens and lack the inherent flexibility to be applied broadly across multiple therapeutic areas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potentially serious side effects: Many previous and current cellular therapies can cause serious side effects, often attributed to the regenerative nature of these cells, including cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and death. In addition, their application to solid tumors has led to on-target tissue based toxicities based on antigen selectivity. These alternative cellular therapies contain a nucleus and retain the ability to expand and differentiate post‑injection, potentially raising concern of uncontrolled cell division and transformation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Unpredictable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution: Current cellular therapies have an uncertain lifetime post‑infusion, given their regenerative capacity, and may significantly divide and expand in cell number. In some cases, the therapeutic benefits quickly wane. In others, the cells will continue to divide, expand and potentially transform unpredictably over an extended period of time. Additionally, these cellular therapies can extravasate in an untargeted manner into healthy tissues throughout the body, which may result in severe adverse effects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Costly manufacturing and delayed treatment: Most previous and current cellular therapies are autologous, meaning they must be derived from a patient’s own cells to avoid rejection by the immune system. This results in a strictly customized, one‑to‑one manufacturing process for each individual patient, which is costly and difficult to scale, and involves a complex supply chain that can delay treatment for 2 to 3 months for critically ill patients. Moreover, this approach does not allow for an industrialized effort that can be leveraged to rapidly develop additional product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Advantages and versatility of our RED PLATFORM and RCTs
 Our discoveries and innovations in genetic engineering and cell culture processes allows us to leverage the inherent benefits of RBCs. We believe our RED PLATFORM and RCTs represent a transformative step in the evolution of cellular therapies as they are designed to confer desirable attributes for a next generation cellular therapy, including the following:

 
  9
 


· | Broad therapeutic applications: We have engineered hundreds of RCTs to have therapeutic potential across many areas, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. For example, these RCTs can be designed to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines on the cell surface, including combinations of proteins for potent cell‑cell interaction with T cells, NK cells or antigen-specific T cells for the potential treatment of cancer; or to express autoimmune disease-associated antigens within or on the cell surface to induce immune tolerance for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advantageous tolerability: Since RCTs lack a nucleus, they possess no genetic material and do not divide following administration to patients. As a result, we believe our RCT product candidates will pose less risk than those associated with other cellular therapies, which have caused cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and death and carry the potential risk of inducing oncogenicity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ready‑to‑use cellular therapies: O negative donor blood is routinely used for blood transfusions and can be repeatedly transfused into approximately 95% of people. Similarly, RCTs are produced from O negative donor blood stem cells and are therefore allogeneic, ready‑to‑use cellular therapies that we believe will be tolerated by nearly all patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Defined life in circulation and convenient dosing: For the treatment of cancer, we expect our cells to activate and expand the body’s immune system cells to attack and kill tumors. In our preclinical studies, we have shown that this cell-to-cell interaction with the immune system occurs within a short period of time. Furthermore, a single proposed RCT dose will likely constitute less than 1% of normal red cells in a patient’s circulation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Predictable biodistribution: RBCs normally reside only in the vasculature, the spleen and the liver and do not otherwise extravasate into other healthy tissues. Biodistribution into the spleen allows for RCTs designed to stimulate the immune system to mount an attack against cancer, while biodistribution of RCTs expressing autoimmune disease‑associated antigens to specialized cells in the liver can induce tolerance and improve the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases. We anticipate that this predictable biodistribution will allow RCTs to generate desired clinical activity while avoiding off-tissue engagement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Efficient product engine: Our RED PLATFORM provides a consistent product design and discovery approach where changing the added gene or genes that encode the biotherapeutic proteins that confer the intended therapeutic benefit allows us to develop new product candidates targeting different diseases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scalable and flexible manufacturing: We manufacture RCTs in bioreactors that we intend to scale over time to support clinical trials and then commercial availability upon regulatory approval. A single donor is expected to support the manufacturing of up to thousands of doses, depending on the therapeutic application. As a result, we expect the cost of goods sold for RCTs to eventually be significantly lower than existing cellular therapies, such as CAR T therapy. We manufacture RCTs using well‑characterized and validated lentiviral vectors. In addition, we are exploring other cellular engineering approaches, such as viral and non‑viral transduction systems and mRNA delivery, which could be applied to RCTs and potentially provide additional product benefits and cost advantages.

  Our strategy
 Our vision is to create life-changing, allogeneic cellular therapies for patients with severe diseases. To achieve our vision, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements:
 Establish RCTs as a new class of cellular medicines, demonstrating their potential across two initial product categories: cancer and autoimmune diseases. We apply a rigorous and capital‑efficient approach to prioritize our product candidate pipeline, focusing on unmet need, feasibility, speed to proof‑of‑concept, cost to manufacture, validated endpoints and commercial potential. Our IND application for RTX-240 has been allowed to proceed by the FDA. Additionally, we plan to file an IND for RTX-321 by year-end.

 
  10
 

 Pursue accelerated paths to marketing authorization. We are pursuing indications with high unmet needs that may allow us to pursue accelerated paths to product registration, such as breakthrough therapy designation or RMAT designation by the FDA. Similarly, we expect to pursue accelerated routes to marketing authorization in Europe and other regions.
 Build a leading, fully integrated cellular therapy company. We are discovering, developing, manufacturing and may commercialize RCT products within certain product categories. Following potential approval of multiple RCT products in a particular category, we may leverage a dedicated commercial infrastructure to deliver our therapies to patients.
 Further strengthen our position as the pioneer of RCTs through continuous platform expansion and improvement. Our proprietary RED PLATFORM allows us to rapidly identify new product candidates and includes a universal manufacturing process for all RCT product candidates. We will continue to invest in enhancing our platform and deepening our expertise in stem cell and red cell biology and optimizing the pharmacology of RCTs with the goal of delivering new therapies targeting additional indications. We plan to leverage our first‑mover advantage in manufacturing RCTs as we scale‑up our proprietary manufacturing platform and fully-owned, operational cGMP manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI. 
 Expand patient access to RCTs through strategic partnerships. Given the breadth of therapeutic opportunities for RCTs, we believe entering into select strategic partnerships in a subset of therapeutic areas may provide an attractive avenue for expanding patient access to RCTs. The global reach and operational expertise within certain pharmaceutical companies may complement our growing organization in areas such as clinical development and commercialization.
 Maintain a strong culture, continuously attract new talent and build the world’s leading center for red cell biology research and engineering. We are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the world’s leading hubs for biopharmaceutical innovation, which enables us access to world‑class talent, leading academic investigators and key opinion leaders. We have leveraged our location to attract scientific talent and experienced, innovative leaders and have built a strong culture that is committed to delivering on our vision. In addition, we have assembled a network of scientific advisors with deep expertise in red cell biology, process development and manufacturing as well as clinical experience across the therapeutic areas that we are initially targeting. We will continue to build a team of employees, advisors and collaborators with experience in the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of cellular therapies.
 Our product candidate pipeline
 Rubius Therapeutics is advancing a broad and diverse pipeline of RCT™ product candidates. Our current programs are investigating applications across cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our IND application for RTX-240 has been allowed to proceed by the FDA and we plan to announce when the first patient has been dosed. We plan to submit an IND for RTX-321 by the end of 2020. Our first product candidates were selected based on: potential to address unmet needs; feasibility as determined by our preclinical research and development efforts; potential to rapidly achieve proof‑of‑concept based on validated regulatory endpoints; cost of goods to manufacture; and significant commercial potential.
 Cancer
 We believe that RCTs will have broad therapeutic applicability across a range of both solid and hematological cancers and are developing a pipeline of RCTs that target T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, tumor cells, or combinations thereof. Our RCT oncology pipeline is unique in the field of immuno-oncology as our RCTs can target cancer in both a non-specific manner (combining T cell agonists and cytokines on the cell surface) for broad immune system stimulation and in an antigen-specific approach with our artificial antigen-presenting cells to generate an antigen-specific response. We are rapidly advancing one of each to the clinic. In addition to investigating the single-agent activity of each RCT product candidate in the clinic, we plan to evaluate our RCTs in combination with other immuno-oncology agents, as well as standard of care therapy (e.g. chemotherapy or signaling inhibitors). 

 
  11
 

 Our lead oncology product candidate, RTX-240, is designed to broadly stimulate the immune system without antigen specificity. RTX-240 expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP, a fusion of IL‑15 and IL‑15 receptor alpha, on the cell surface. This combination is synergistic and designed to activate and expand both T cells and NK cells. Our IND application for RTX-240 has been allowed to proceed by the FDA and we plan to announce when the first patient is dosed. 
 Additionally, we are advancing RCTs that function as artificial antigen presenting cells, or aAPCs, that express a tumor-associated antigen, a co-stimulatory signal and a cytokine at the same time on the same cell. These cells are designed to induce a tumor-specific immune response by expanding antigen-specific T cells. RTX-321, our lead aAPC program, expresses an HPV peptide antigen bound to MHC I, 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. We plan to file an IND for RTX-321 for the treatment of HPV-positive tumors by the end of 2020.
 Broad Immune System Stimulation: RTX-240 and RTX-224 for the treatment of solid tumors
 RTX-240 and RTX-224 are designed to broadly stimulate and expand the adaptive and innate immune systems through potent cell-cell interaction to attack and kill tumors, replicating how the immune system naturally functions.
 RTX-240 is engineered to express hundreds of thousands of copies of 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP, a fusion of IL‑15 and IL‑15 receptor alpha, on the cell surface. This combination is synergistic and designed to activate and expand both T cells and NK cells. RTX-224 is engineered to expresses hundreds of thousands of copies of 4‑1BBL and IL‑12. IL-12 drives the activation and proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as well as NK cells. In addition, the IL-12 cytokine is known to drive antigen presentation and inhibit angiogenesis.
 We believe that both product candidates provide potentially transformative and differentiated approaches to treating patients with solid or hematological tumors whose disease responds to immunotherapies, including CAR-T, as well as tumors that are or have become resistant or refractory to immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors. We expect to initially study RTX-240 across a range of solid tumor types and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. We expect to study RTX-224 in patients with a range of solid tumors.
 Each of RTX-240 and RTX-224 have been engineered to act as combination therapies that stimulate both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system. We believe this synergistic activity has the potential to provide the following therapeutic benefits:

· | Improved anti‑tumor activity through broad and sustained activation of the immune system: Both RTX-240 and RTX-224 drive robust stimulation of T cells and NK cells as 4‑1BBL and the cytokines (IL-15TP or IL-12) are simultaneously presented in high copy numbers to these immune cells, thereby simulating a potent adaptive and innate immune response. We expect this to result in improved outcomes, either as monotherapy or in combination with existing immunomodulatory therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prevention of resistance to immunotherapy: T cells recognize and kill cancer cells via MHC I. A recognized mechanism of tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is loss of MHC I expression, which makes the cancer less susceptible to T cell mediated killing. However, loss of MHC I makes the tumor susceptible to recognition and killing by the NK cells that have been expanded and activated by RTX-240 or RTX-224. We, therefore, expect that RTX-240 or RTX-224 used either alone or in combination with immunotherapies could prevent the emergence of resistance to T cell mediated killing through potent NK cell activation and expansion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Efficacious in tumors that are resistant or refractory to immunotherapy: We expect RTX-240 and RTX-224 to provide therapeutic benefits to patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitors. In these patients, we expect that RTX-240 and RTX-224 will promote tumor killing through NK cell and T cell activation and expansion. The addition of IL-12 to 4-1BBL, in the case of RTX-224, is expected to drive the upregulation of T cell and NK cell activity, as well as angiogenesis inhibition and antigen presentation. The latter is important when addressing tumors that do not respond to existing immunotherapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  12
 


· | Tolerability: We expect RTX-240 and RTX-224 to be confined to the vasculature, spleen and liver. We believe this makes these product candidates less likely to have side effects and more likely to have a broad therapeutic window. Direct systemic administration of cytokines, including IL‑15, IL-12 and other interleukins, is currently limited by safety and tolerability concerns, which result in a narrower therapeutic window.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Current therapies and their limitations
 Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti‑programmed death receptor‑1 antibodies, or anti‑PD‑1 antibodies, act by inhibiting tumor suppression of the adaptive immune system in cancer patients and have significantly extended survival in multiple solid tumor types, particularly in patients with advanced cancers. The vast potential of checkpoint inhibitors is highlighted by market projections that estimate sales for this class of drugs could reach $50 billion in 2024. Despite the encouraging efficacy of checkpoint inhibition for some patients, overall response rates remain relatively low and range, on average, from 25% to 50%. Unfortunately, even when a patient’s cancer does respond to treatment, the disease often progresses within six to 12 months, depending on the cancer and the therapeutic intervention. Clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly evaluating combination therapies to improve response rates and to expand the size of the treatable population.
 Preclinical data for RTX-240
 RTX-240 expresses 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP on the cell surface to stimulate an adaptive and innate immune response through dual stimulation of both pathways. 4-1BBL has known costimulatory effects to promote the proliferation and activation of natural killer (NK) cells as well as CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes. IL-15 may enhance the proliferation and survival of memory CD8 T cells, reduce their activation threshold and promote resistance to the effects of regulatory T cells. IL-15 also enhances proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD56+ NK cells.

 4-1BBL, 4-1BB ligand; IL-15TP, trans-presented interleukin-15 (IL-15/IL-15 receptor alpha fusion); NK, natural killer; TCR, T cell receptor; Treg, T regulatory.
 Using a Jurkat human T cell line expressing 4-1BB, we observed potent activation of the 4-1BB signaling pathway with RTX-240, as shown in the following chart. Importantly, we showed that the same level of activation was not induced by molar equivalent doses of 4-1BB agonist antibody. As expected, the control RCT, or RTX‑CTRL, was also inactive. We observed that cellular presentation of 4-1BBL in its native conformation on RTX-240 leads to approximately 10-fold higher activation of 4-1BB pathway than with a 4-1BB agonist antibody.

 NFkB Activation by RTX-240 in Jurkat Cells

 Dugast, et. al., American Association for Cancer Research; Poster #3272, 2019.
 Additionally, in preclinical studies, RTX-240 demonstrated synergistic and complementary effects of 4-1BBL and IL-15TP in promoting the expansion and activation of key cells driving innate (NK cells) and adaptive (CD8 memory T cells) immunity. RTX-240 induces potent effects associated with innate and adaptive immune responses in vitro. In RTX-240, the combination of 4-1BBL and IL15TP promotes better expansion of NK and CD8 memory cells than either agent alone, while 4-1BBL drives significant CD8 T cell proliferation, and IL-15TP drives significant NK cell cytotoxicity, as depicted below.

 Used as a murine surrogate for RTX-240, mRBC-240 reduced lung metastases and increased terminally differentiated NK cell lung infiltration in vivo in a B16F10 model. mRBC-240 treatment significantly reduced the number of lung metastases and increased the numbers of NK cells, including terminally differentiated NK cells, in the lungs of treated mice compared with control mice as depicted below. CD8 T Cell and NK Cell Proliferation and Functionality

 In contrast to systemic treatment with a 4-1BB agonist antibody, mRBC‑240 results in no observed organ toxicity in vivo, likely due to restriction of therapy to the vasculature. Levels of aspartate transaminase, or AST, and alanine transaminase, or ALT, were not significantly elevated following administration of mRBC‑240, as compared to administration of mRBC‑CTRL. In contrast, we observed significant transaminase elevations after administration of α4‑1BB mAb. Liver infiltration with macrophages and CD8+ T cells are considered to promote 4‑1BB agonist-induced liver toxicity. As expected, we observed increased liver infiltration with all of these cell populations following treatment with 4‑1BB agonist antibodies. There was no increased liver infiltration with any of these cell populations following mRBC‑240 treatment.

 Lack of Organ Toxicity

 4‑1BB agonistic antibodies are believed to cause liver toxicity through a multi‑step process that begins with activation of bone marrow‑derived monocytes, which subsequently infiltrate the liver, activating Kupffer cells and then CD8+ cells [Barthowiak, et. al., Clinical Cancer Research; 24(5) March 1, 2018]. Our data suggest that mRBC-240 does not stimulate the bone marrow derived monocytes, consistent with the hypothesis that activation occurs in the bone marrow, which has limited exposure to mRBC-240.
 Our in vivo studies of mRBC-240, administered intravenously, or i.v., in a B16F10 lung metastasis mouse model provide further evidence in support of RTX-240. In this model, tumor cells were injected intravenously to establish metastases in the lung and then mice were treated with mRBC-240 alone or in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRBC-240 administered i.v. as a monotherapy reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with mRBC‑CTRL, mRBC‑4‑1BBL and mRBC‑IL‑15TP (left chart below), thereby indicating the potential synergy that may be achieved by expressing both 4‑1‑BBL and IL‑15TP on the cell surface of mRBC-240. The tumor burden reduction that was observed after administration of α4‑1BB mAb was not significantly different from mRBC-240. However, the observed effect of α4‑1BB mAb was at the same dose level that generated hepatotoxicity in mice. As mRBC-240 did not generate liver toxicity in mice, we believe that mRCT-240, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to have an improved therapeutic index, or improved risk‑benefit, over agonistic 4‑1BB antibodies in cancer patients. In a separate study mRBC-240 administered i.v. in combination with the anti‑PD‑1 antibody significantly reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with the negative control mRBC‑CTRL, as well as the anti‑PD‑1 antibody alone (right chart below).

 Activity of mRBC-240 as Monotherapy and in Combination with Anti-PD-1 in a B16F10 Lung Metastasis Mouse Model 

 In summary, we have observed that in vivo the combination of 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP on RTX-240 induces potent expansion and activation of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and key subsets of these cells. In addition, these RTX-240‑mediated effects were much higher than those obtained with a 4-1BB agonist antibody, suggesting the synergy of the combination on RTX-240 for expanding key cell types from both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system. This potent activity translated into efficacy of mRBC-240 administered in in vivo cancer models both as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRCT-240 did not generate hepatotoxicity in mice while an agonistic 4‑1BB mAb did. As a result, we believe that co‑expression of 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP on RTX-240, and the sequestration of RTX-240 in the vasculature has the potential to drive potent anti‑tumor activity with an advantageous tolerability profile. We therefore believe that the ability of RTX-240 to stimulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems will translate into therapeutic benefits for patients with solid and hematological cancers.
 Clinical development
 While checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. Responses are confined to certain tumor types and only a small portion of patients are cured. Currently, the challenge in immunotherapy is to induce responses in refractory tumors as well as to increase the rate and duration of response. By stimulating both arms of the immune system, RTX-240 could be an ideal combination therapy for checkpoint inhibitors to both improve and extend responses.
 We are planning to evaluate RTX-240 as monotherapy and in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy to leverage the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity aspect of RTX-240 and with an anti-PD1 antibody in solid tumors. Cancers that may be included in the PD-1 combination therapy are small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, and head and neck cancer among others. The IND application for RTX-240 as monotherapy has been allowed to proceed by the FDA.
 The MHC complex is an important nexus in the immune system because it is the way T cells recognize and kill cancer cells but it also blocks the killing function of NK cells. A common means of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors is loss of 

 
  17
 
MHC expression making the cancer invisible to T cells. As a result, the cancer becomes susceptible to NK cell dependent killing. Future clinical development of RTX-240 may include patient populations which have progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy due to loss of MHC expression.
 RTX-240 for hematological cancer: relapsing or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, post‑HSCT
 Current therapies and their limitations
 Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is characterized by proliferation of myeloid blasts. They replace the bone marrow so that there is minimal production of platelets, red cells and neutrophils. It is primarily a disease of the elderly with a median age of diagnosis of 68. In 2017, there were more than 20,000 new cases of AML and more than 10,000 deaths caused by AML in the United States.
 Standard first‑line AML treatment has been unchanged for over 40 years: a regimen of intensive induction and consolidation therapy. Although most patients respond, the majority relapse over time. Therefore, many younger patients with AML undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, which can be curative if the transplant is successful. In 2016, more than 3,500 AML patients underwent allogeneic‑HSCT in the United States and over 6,200 underwent the procedure in Europe.
 Recently, additional therapies have been approved for treatment of AML, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CPX‑351, and, for patients with specific mutations, midostaurin and enasidenib. Although these therapies improve response rates and enable more patients to bridge to transplant, overall survival rates remain low.
 Clinical development
 Disease-induced mechanisms in myeloid malignancies like AML have been noted to negatively affect key properties of NK cells such as their differentiation and cytotoxic potential. The resulting NK cell dysfunction is thought to contribute to disease progression in AML. Further, NK cell function during and after treatment for AML is linked to treatment response and outcome, suggesting that NK cells play a key role in this setting. 
 In addition to the general effects of NK cells in the AML setting, the effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT depends on both the killing of residual tumor by high-dose chemotherapy and on graft versus leukemia effects. NK cells are a critical component of the graft versus leukemia effect. After bone marrow ablation and allogeneic transplantation, NK cells are the first lymphocyte population to recover, but their killing and cytokine‑secreting functions are limited when compared to the NK cells of healthy donors. The rate of return and function of NK cells are correlated with treatment outcome post‑allogeneic HSCT, so increasing the number and function of NK cells post‑allogeneic HSCT to stimulate the graft versus leukemia effect has the potential to increase survival in patients receiving allogeneic HSCT for treatment of AML. As discussed above, 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP induce proliferation and maturation of NK cells, supporting the testing of RTX-240 in both the relapsed or refractory transplant-ineligible population as well as the post‑allogeneic HSCT setting. We expect RTX-240 to have effects in AML under both clinical scenarios.
 Initially, we plan to dose escalate RTX-240 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML who are not eligible for an allogeneic transplant to determine the optimal dosing strategy in hematologic malignancies. Assuming initial safety data has been generated, RTX-240 could be evaluated in the post‑allogeneic HSCT setting, using the dose determined in the dose escalation portion of the study.
 Preclinical data for RTX-224
 RTX-224 has been shown to drive both T cell and NK cell activation and expansion by simultaneously and proximately co-expressing IL-12 and 4-1BBL. 
 Our in vivo studies of a murine surrogate of RTX-224, mRBC-224, administered subcutaneously in an MC38 colon cancer mouse model provide evidence in support of RTX-224’s immune activation and tumor control. In this model, tumor cells were injected to establish growing tumors and then mice were treated with a control mRBC alone, mRBC-

 
  18
 
224 alone, an anti-PD1 antibody in combination with mRBC-CTRL, or with mRBC-224 in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. mRBC-224 administered as a monotherapy reduced tumor burden in mice compared to those treated with mRBC‑CTRL with or without and anti-PD1 antibody. mRCT-224 administered alone resulted in 5/11 tumor regressions, while mRCT-224 administered in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody resulted in 9/11 tumor regressions. These results are depicted below.
 Activity of mRBC-224 in an MC38 Colon Cancer Mouse Model 

 Dugast, et. al., American Association for Cancer Research; Poster #3256, 2019.
 In additional preclinical studies, mRBC-224 demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition in both lung metastatic and subcutaneous B16F10 models. As shown below mRBC-224 is as effective as the anti-4-1BB antibody 3H3 (left panel below) or more effective (right panel below) without causing toxicity seen by 3H3 alone (change in body weight in graph below titled “Organ Toxicity in Mice”).  Lung Metastasis and Subcutaneous B16F10 Tumor Mouse Model

 Dugast, et. al., American Association for Cancer Research; Poster #3256, 2019.
 In contrast to systemic recombinant IL-12, mRBC-224 resulted in significantly reduced toxicity likely due to restriction of therapy to the vasculature. Mice treated with mRBC-224 maintained body weight over time, whereas mice administered systemic recombinant IL-12, with or without a 4-1BB agonist antibody, demonstrated significant loss of 

 
  19
 
body weight versus controls. mRBC-treated mice had no evidence of liver toxicity, which was observed based on no increase in serum alanine transaminase and liver weight, compared to mice treated with systemic recombinant IL-12. The charts below summarize these results.
 Organ Toxicity in Mice

 Dugast, et. al., American Association for Cancer Research; Poster #3256, 2019.
 In summary, 4-1BBL and IL-12 have synergistic and complementary effects in promoting innate and adaptive immunity. We have observed that the combination of 4‑1BBL and IL‑12 induces efficacy in multiple cancer models both as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti‑PD‑1 antibody. In contrast to systemic recombinant IL-12, RTX-224 resulted in significantly reduced toxicity likely due to restriction of therapy to the vasculature. As a result, we believe that co‑expression of 4‑1BBL and IL‑12 on RTX-224, and the sequestration of RTX-224 in the vasculature has the potential to drive potent anti‑tumor activity with an advantageous tolerability profile. We therefore believe that the ability of RTX-224 to stimulate both the innate and adaptive immune systems will translate into therapeutic benefits for patients with solid tumors.
 Clinical development
 While checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. Responses are confined to certain tumor types and only a limited portion of patients are cured. Currently, the challenge in immunotherapy is to induce responses in refractory tumors as well as to increase the rate and duration of response. By stimulating both arms of the immune system, RTX-224 could be an ideal combination therapy for checkpoint inhibitors to both improve and extend responses. 
 IL-12 is known to drive the activation and proliferation of T cells and NK cells and promote antigen presentation on dendritic cells. This antigen presentation may enable us to target formerly non-immunogenic tumors by enhancing their immune signature.

 
  20
 

 In the future, we are planning to evaluate RTX-224 in solid tumors as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer agents. We also plan to study RTX-224 in patients whose disease has progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
 Antigen-specific immune stimulation: Artificial antigen presenting Red Cell Therapeutic product candidates, RTX-321 for HPV-positive tumors
 Current therapies and their limitations
 Immuno-oncologists are pursuing multiple approaches to target antigens for the purpose of killing cancer cells. Previously mentioned CAR-T cell therapies are an autologous approach that engineers a patient’s own T cells ex vivo to target a specific antigen, but have thus far demonstrated limited benefit outside of certain hematological malignancies and have had challenges with manufacturing and scale. Other companies are using different therapeutic modalities to try to expand the number of T cells targeting a particular antigen in vivo, such as BioNTech SE using RNA and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. using DNA-based therapy. However, to date, these approaches have had challenges generating sufficient quantity and quality of immune responses against particular antigens, which has limited their efficacy. As a result, there remains a need for more effective therapies that target cancer, or cancer-associated antigens. 
 Preclinical data for artificial antigen presenting Red Cell Therapeutics and RTX-321

We have created RCT product candidates that function as artificial APCs, or aAPCs, with the potential to induce a tumor-specific immune response by expanding antigen-specific T cells.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The RED PLATFORM permits us to engineer a variety of proteins in their native state on the cell surface. For aAPCs, we can express signals 1, 2 and 3, which are necessary for the expansion and activation of antigen-specific T cells. We can engineer MHC that presents a tumor‑specific peptide antigen, or signal 1, with a costimulatory protein, such as 4‑1BBL, or signal 2, and a cytokine, such as IL-12, or signal 3. When co-expressed and delivered simultaneously and proximately, signal 1+2 promotes T cell activation/initial proliferation and potentially memory and signal 3 can increase T cell expansion further and support the maintenance of T cell memory. Additionally, the ability to significantly expand and activate a tumor-specific T cell population to kill tumors in vivo shares characteristics with CAR‑T therapies, which administer a tumor-specific T cell population that can expand, sometimes uncontrollably, in the patient. By controlling the RTX‑aAPC dose, we believe that we can more effectively control the expansion of the tumor-specific T cells and potentially the tolerability and effects of the therapy. Current treatment options for refractory and relapsing disease are limited, and we expect to be able to offer patients a potent and highly specific immune stimulation.

RTX-321, our lead artificial antigen presenting cell program, expresses an HPV peptide antigen bound to MHC I, 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. We plan to file an IND for RTX-321 for the treatment of HPV-positive tumors by the end of 2020. 

 
  21
 

 RTX‑aAPCs Mimic the APC‑T Cell Interaction to Provide Antigen-Specific Cancer Therapies
 The figure below schematically depicts the interaction between our artificial antigen-presenting cell (RTX-aAPC) and a T cell. The RTX-aAPC delivers all three signals required for optimal activation of the T cells. Signal 1 is an antigenic peptide presented by an MHC Class I molecule; signal 2 is a costimulatory signal (4-1BBL is used in the examples below); and signal 3 is a cytokine (IL-12 used in the studies below).

 As a first step to examine the potential of RTX-aAPCs, we have constructed a murine surrogate, termed mRBC-aAPC which expresses signals 1 and 2 (ovalbumin, or OVA; and 4-1BBL, respectively). We observed that an mRBC-aAPC expressing signals 1 and 2 activates ovalbumin‑specific T cells and potently expands OVA-specific T cells (OT1 cells) with a memory phenotype (CD44+) in vitro compared with control cells expressing signal 1 alone or signal 2 alone.

 
  22
 

 Activation of Ovalbumin (OVA)‑Specific T Cells with mRBC‑aAPC (OVA)

 Zhang, et. al., Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer; Poster #P233, 2019.
 We have also observed that when ovalbumin‑specific transgenic T cells (OTI‑T cells) are expanded and activated by mRBC‑aAPC (expressing ovalbumin peptide – OVA – presented by MHC class I plus 4-1BBL) selectively kill ovalbumin‑expressing tumor cells (EG7.OVA cells), while the parental cells that do not express ovalbumin (EL4) are not eliminated.

 
  23
 

 Activity of OT1‑T Cells Expanded With mRBC‑aAPC (OVA)

 Zhang, et. al., American Association for Cancer Research; Poster #3260, 2019.
 Furthermore, we have observed in vivo in mice that mRBC‑aAPC (OVA + 4-1BBL) specifically expand and activate OT1 T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes (60- and 30-fold). Importantly, we find that the majority of the OT1 T cells display a central memory phenotype (not shown), which has been found to be a key population driving the effectiveness of T cell-based therapies. In addition, a large proportion of these cells are found to traffic to lymph nodes, which supports their potential to effectively mobilize within the body and to the tumor to support a robust anti‑tumor response. In contrast, the mRBC-CTRL (expressing 4-1BBL without antigen on the cell surface) did not expand or activate OTI‑T cells, thereby indicating that mRBC‑aAPCs mimic the function of antigen presenting cells in vivo. 
 mRBC-aAPC (OVA) Increases CD8 OT1 T Cell Numbers in the Spleen and Lymph Nodes

 Zhang, et. al., Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer; Poster #P233, 2019.
 As noted above, OT1 T cells that are expanded and activated by mRBC‑aAPC (OVA) selectively kill ovalbumin‑expressing tumor cells, or EG7.OVA cells. In the experiment depicted below, mRBC-aAPC (OVA) treatment promoted regressions and increased survival in a mouse tumor model compared to controls. Additionally, the number of antigen-specific cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph node also increased with mRBC-aAPC (OVA) treatment in this tumor model relative to controls.

 mRBC‑aAPC (OVA) Promotes Substantial Regressions and Increases Survival in an EG7.OVA Mouse Tumor Model
    
     Zhang, et. al., Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer; Poster #P233, 2019.
 As additional proof of concept, we engineered mouse red cells with hundreds of thousands of copies of MHC I loaded with the gp100 peptide, a melanoma antigen, 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface (i.e., signals 1+2+3) and tested these in a B16-F10 melanoma mouse model. These cells (mRBC-gp100-4-1BBL-IL-12) promoted the expansion and effector function of adoptively transferred antigen-specific Pmel T cells, and nearly eliminated lung metastases at the highest dose levels. Also, mRBC-gp100-4-1BBL-IL-12 promoted gp100-specific T cell expansion (Pmel cells) in the circulation, secondary lymphoid organs and lungs. Importantly, mRBC-gp100-4-1BBL-IL-12 not only augmented the functional responses of adoptively transferred Pmel cells, but also induced effector responses in endogenous CD8 T cells, indicating that the mRBC was able to stimulate an immune response in pre-existing cells.

 aAPC Targeted Against a Tumor-Associated Melanoma Antigen gp100

 Zhang, et. al., Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer; Poster #P233, 2019.
 Finally, we observed that our lead product candidate, RTX-321 (HPV+) can activate an HPV-specific TCR transduced T cell line as well as primary human T cells. In the experiment shown below, untransduced primary human T cells or T cells transduced with an HPV-specific T cell receptor were cultured with RCTs that expressed either nothing, signals 2+3 (i.e., no antigen), signals 1+2, or RTX-321. No cell expansion was observed in the absence of antigen. An RCT expressing HPV antigen plus 4-1BBL induced modest expansion of HPV-responsive T cells, but RTX-321 was at least 10-fold more potent. 

 Zhang, et. al., Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer; Poster #P233, 2019.
 Collectively, we believe these preclinical data support the development of RTX-321 for the treatment of HPV 16-positive tumors, including head and neck and cervical cancer. We plan to file in IND for RTX-321 by the end of 2020.
 The potential applications of RTX‑aAPCs span both solid and hematological cancers and there are many known tumor antigens common to certain cancers that can be targeted for development. In addition to a program in HPV 16+ tumors, we are exploring the use of shared and personal tumor neoantigens to deliver more accessible and effective treatments than standard vaccines or alternative neoantigen approaches.

 Autoimmune diseases
 RCT product candidates for the induction of antigen‑specific tolerance
 We have generated RCT product candidates that express antigens within the cell, on the cell surface, or as presented by major histocompatibility complex II, and we believe that this represents a powerful antigen‑presenting platform for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes. In addition, we have the ability to express immune-modulating cytokines, enzymes, or inhibitory signals, which may have the potential to induce tolerance. We believe that if successful, this approach will allow us to address a wide range of autoimmune diseases. 
 We are currently assessing several tolerance inducing RCT product candidates. We anticipate that our lead product candidate will focus on an indication where treatment effects are easily measurable and proof-of-concept can be demonstrated in an efficient manner.
 Current therapies and their limitations
 Over the past two decades, considerable progress has been made in the treatment of a range of autoimmune disorders with many patients enjoying an improvement in quality of life as a result. Despite their success, current therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases are either generally or specifically immunosuppressive and expose patients to an increased risk of opportunistic infection and hematological cancers, as is the case with JAK inhibitors, anti‑TNF antibodies and anti‑CD20 targeted antibodies. In up to one third of cases, patients with autoimmune diseases fail to respond to treatment, and most responding patients ultimately lose responsiveness over time.
 While the triggers of most autoimmune diseases remain unknown, it is generally understood that clinical disease is the result of a loss of tolerance to one’s own cells. The accepted model of disease assumes a genetic susceptibility triggered by an environmental event, which leads to a breakdown of T cell‑mediated immune suppression. In principle, restoration of peripheral tolerance should provide patients with a partial or complete cure.
 A range of competitive approaches to peripheral tolerance restoration have been investigated over the last few decades. These include the oral administration and direct injection of a protein or peptide with or without immunosuppression, the creation of peptide bearing nanoparticles and the adoptive transfer of engineered regulatory T cells. Thus far, these approaches have not proven to be successful in late‑stage clinical trials, but the field continues to progress. Direct administration of peptides and nanoparticles suffer biodistribution, stability, presentation and orientation challenges which limit the effectiveness of cell‑cell signaling. To date, adoptive transfer approaches are all autologous and are hampered by some of the same handling and scalability issues that limit the application of other cellular therapies. By contrast, RCT breakdown by antigen presenting cells in the liver is thought to recapitulate the normal process of self / non‑self recognition training that would lead to tolerance induction. When compared with contemporary and historical approaches of tolerance induction, RCTs could represent a clinically meaningful step forward.
 Preclinical data 
 In a commonly used preclinical mouse model of neurodegeneration, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, or EAE model, we have observed induction of peripheral tolerance using a murine RCT displaying the model‑specific antigen associated with neuronal demyelination, the MOG 35‑55 peptide. In the experiment depicted below, murine RCT‑MOG, or mRBC‑MOG, and control mouse RBCs were administered to mice at a disease score of 0.5 to1.0. The mRBC‑MOG‑treated animals were brought back to an average disease score of zero, while control animals continued to progress to limited disability. More significantly, as depicted in the second experiment, following treatment with mRBC‑MOG and control mouse RBCs at a disease score of three, indicating that the animals were paralyzed, we observed a remarkable recovery curve following treatment with murine mRBC‑MOG. In effect, mice exhibiting paralysis were made to walk again through tolerance induction via exposure to the peptide MOG on the mouse red cell.

 
  27
 

 mRBC‑MOG Effect on Mice with Moderate EAE (Left) and Paralyzed EAE Mice (Right) 

 Upon examination of the histopathology, the difference in the damage to spinal cord tissue between the control and treated mice was notable. In addition, treatment with mRBC‑MOG cells was found to dramatically reduce the infiltration of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 CD4+ cells that have been shown to drive disease progression.
 Effect of mRBC‑MOG on Th1 and Th17 Cells in the Spinal Cord in EAE Mice

 In further preclinical studies in EAE mice, we observed that mouse RBCs and mRBC‑MOG cells are taken up by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC) and Kupffer cells within the liver, and that mRBC‑MOG upregulates PD‑L1, an immunosuppressive marker, on APCs, while control mouse RBCs do not. The above findings suggest that red blood cell uptake into APCs promotes an immunosuppressive phenotype that then drives the reduction in pathogenic Th1 and Th17 T cells in the spinal cord, thereby providing evidence for the mechanism of action for RCT‑driven tolerance induction.

 
  28
 

 Effect of mRBC‑MOG in Immunosuppressive on the Phenotype of APCs in EAE Mice

 Beyond observations of therapeutic effects in this disease model, we have generated evidence of the development of immunologic memory following treatment with mRBC‑MOG, suggesting the possibility of a cure. Using the EAE animal model, mice were first treated with either mRBC‑MOG or control mouse RBCs on Days 5 and 17. Following a 40‑day washout period after which the administered mouse RBCs were no longer in circulation, the EAE mice were re‑challenged with MOG peptide to re‑stimulate an immune response. We observed a clear improvement in survival between the mRBC‑MOG treated group and the control group, indicating that mRBC‑MOG treated animals maintained immunological memory which protected them from the re‑challenge.
 Survival of Previously mRBC‑MOG Treated EAE Mice After a Second MOG Challenge

 The ability of antigen‑presenting RBCs to drive tolerance induction in a preclinical model of Type 1 diabetes was recently demonstrated by our collaborators, Professors Hidde Ploegh and Harvey Lodish. In their study, NOD/ShiltJ mice, a strain genetically engineered to develop Type 1 diabetes after 10 to 13 weeks, were either treated with control RBCs or with RBCs that displayed a peptide consisting of the amino acids 9‑23 of insulin B‑chain on the cell surface. All mice receiving control RBCs became hyperglycemic while most mice receiving RBCs displaying the insulin peptide were protected from Type 1 diabetes onset and remained normoglycemic.

 
  29
 

 Overall, we and our collaborators have generated compelling preclinical evidence in support of applying antigen‑expressing RCT product candidates to induce antigen‑specific tolerance for the treatment of a range of autoimmune diseases.
 Autoimmune disease discovery research
 Beyond developing RCTs that express one or more antigens for the treatment in antigen‑induced autoimmune diseases, we are exploring the potential to apply RCT product candidates to directly stimulate specific populations of regulatory T cells or delete pathogenic CD4 cells and direct the immune system back to a more tolerogenic state. We have also created RCT constructs that clear lethal doses of TNF‑alpha and botulinum toxin from the bloodstream of mice, suggesting that RCTs may also provide therapeutic benefits to patients suffering from severe inflammatory diseases.
 Rare Diseases 
 Until March 2020, we had been developing RTX-134 for the treatment of PKU. We had also been developing RCT product candidates for the treatment of other rare diseases such as chronic refractory gout and homocystinuria.
 The IND for RTX-134 was allowed to proceed by the FDA in March 2019. The first patient was enrolled in the trial in January 2020. RTX-134 administration was well tolerated. While there were no reported adverse events, the results from the first patient were uninterpretable possibly due, in part, to the low dose of cells administered and the sensitivity of the flow cytometry assay used to evaluate cell circulation. 
 In March 2020, we decided to discontinue the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial and deprioritized RTX-134 and our other rare disease programs, to primarily focus on the development of our oncology and autoimmunity pipeline. Multiple factors contributed to this decision, including unanticipated delays in the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial, primarily due to continued manufacturing challenges at our CMO, the anticipated high cost associated with producing chronic, high-dose therapy for enzyme deficiencies and favorable preclinical data from our oncology pipeline. Future capital investments and improvements in manufacturing efficiency, together with enhancements to the RED PLATFORM®, may enable us to revisit chronic, high-dose rare diseases in the future. 
 Manufacturing
 We have industrialized the production of RCTs by developing and scaling up a manufacturing process by which hematopoietic progenitor cells are expanded, then genetically engineered and subsequently differentiated and matured into enucleated RCTs that express biotherapeutic proteins within the cell or on the cell surface. Our standard RCT manufacturing process includes the following steps:
(1) | Donors are screened for infectious diseases according to regulatory guidelines and are typed for major blood group antigens. O negative blood donors are selected and administered granulocyte colony stimulating factor to mobilize their bone marrow.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells are isolated from universal donor blood, collected by apheresis and purified.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | These precursor cells are transduced using a lentiviral vector encoding one or more chosen biotherapeutic proteins.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | The cells are then exposed to a defined media formulation in a bioreactor to promote further expansion and differentiation until they differentiate and mature into enucleated reticulocytes. At this stage, the enucleated reticulocytes are RCTs that express one or more biotherapeutic proteins in the cytosol or on the cell surface.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | The RCTs are purified, formulated and stored at 4°C or frozen.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------

  A single donor is expected to allow us to manufacture up to thousands of doses when we reach full manufacturing capacity. With approximately 7% of the U.S. population having an O negative blood type, we believe that there is ample supply of CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells needed to produce our RCTs. Additionally, due to the inherent properties 

 
  30
 
of RBCs, RCTs can be manufactured in large bioreactors using our proprietary cell culture processes, which could result in the cost of goods sold being significantly lower than other cellular therapies.
 The FDA has approved our established and compliant manufacturing process capable of producing product candidates for clinical use following the current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP operations. We expect to be able to use the same or similar manufacturing processes for all our future RCT product candidates, which would enable us to bring RCTs into clinical development in an accelerated manner.
 Based on our expertise in red cell biology and advice from leading hematologists and blood transfusion experts, we have developed RCT product release criteria to determine the purity, viability, red cell identity and potency of each RCT batch. These release criteria have been reviewed and accepted for clinical use by the FDA.
 We manufacture RCTs in bioreactors, which enable us to control critical process parameters and thereby produce consistent RCTs that meet the established product release criteria. We are currently working to further increase yields and plan to scale into larger bioreactors for eventual commercialization. We currently use external suppliers for lentiviral vector production but have developed an internal lentiviral vector production process, which may be used in the future.
 In addition to the standard RCT manufacturing process, we have developed alternative proprietary processes for engineering hematopoietic precursor cells and maturing these into RCTs. These processes may be utilized in the production of future RCTs.
 Expanding our manufacturing capacity and supply chain

To enable us to produce consistent and reproducible product at greater scale, in July 2018, we acquired and began renovating a 135,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing facility in Smithfield, RI. As of January 2020, this manufacturing facility is operational and is expected to provide cGMP material for clinical supply and commercial product upon regulatory approval. We plan to provide clinical supply for our upcoming RTX-240 and RTX-321 cancer clinical trials from this site. In addition, we have the potential to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities in Smithfield, RI and plan to stage additional investments based on future supply needs.
 Suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations
 In 2018, we entered into a clinical supply agreement with a CMO located in the United States to produce cGMP grade RTX‑134 for our initial clinical trial in PKU. We experienced multiple manufacturing challenges with this CMO that contributed to delays in the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial. Although we were able to manufacture clinical grade RTX-134 for the first time during the third quarter of 2019, continued challenges contributed to further clinical trial delays following the dosing of the first patient in January 2020. In March 2020, we decided to discontinue the RTX-134 Phase 1b clinical trial and deprioritized RTX-134 and our other rare disease programs, to primarily focus on the development of our oncology and autoimmunity pipeline. 
 We have entered into agreements with a supplier of cGMP grade plasmids for lentiviral production as well as a supplier of lentiviral vector. We have secured cGMP lentiviral vector production slots that will provide the initial supply of RTX-240 drug product for the beginning of our planned Phase 1 trials, and we are continually securing additional lentiviral production slots for the additional RCT product candidates that are projected to enter clinical trials.
 Intellectual property
 We believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from our collaborators or other third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and 

 
  31
 
know‑how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of engineered red cell therapeutics. We additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available and plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and possess substantial know‑how and trade secrets relating to our proprietary product candidates, technology and platform, including related manufacturing processes and technology. As for our product candidates, platform, and the processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we pursue, as appropriate, patent protection or trade secret protection relating to compositions, methods of use, treatment of indications, dosing, formulations and methods of manufacturing. As of February 29, 2020, our patent portfolio consists of 32 patent families, including 12 issued U.S. patents, 46 owned or in‑licensed U.S. pending patent applications (including provisional applications), and 109 owned or in‑licensed pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications) that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our product candidates and certain aspects of our RED PLATFORM and our manufacturing processes. Examples of the products and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below.
 Disease‑related intellectual property
 The disease‑related patent rights in our intellectual property portfolio relate to pathological conditions and disorders and provide coverage for RCT product candidates to specifically address those conditions and the associated disease states. The disease‑related patent applications for our lead programs include those described below. Each of the disease‑related patent rights and applications described below are owned by us and are not licensed from any third party:

RTX-240 and RTX-224 for certain oncology indications

We have developed RTX-240, an RCT product candidate that expresses 4‑1BBL and IL‑15TP (a fusion of the cytokine IL‑15 and IL‑15 receptor alpha), for the treatment of patients suffering from hematological or solid cancers that have lost response to conventional therapies, including anti‑PD‑1 therapies or other immune-oncology therapies, and to prevent the emergence of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and other immune-oncology therapies. We have developed RTX-224, an RCT product candidate that co‑expresses 4‑1BBL and IL‑12, for the treatment of patients suffering from hematological or solid cancers that have lost response to conventional therapies, have failed to qualify for or respond to or have lost response to immunotherapy, including anti‑PD‑1 therapies or other immune-oncology therapies, and to prevent the emergence of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and other immune-oncology therapies.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Additional oncology intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCTs for use in oncology, including immuno‑oncology. These patent applications relate to RCT compositions that comprise a variety of agents, including anti‑tumor antibodies, tumor starvation enzymes, pro‑apoptotic proteins, costimulatory molecules, immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor antigens, MHC molecules and numerous combinations thereof. These patent applications also cover the use of RCTs to treat cancer, including lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, as well as various relapsed or refractory cancers.
 We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Autoimmune disease intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCTs for use in treating autoimmune diseases. These patent applications relate to RCT compositions having autoimmune antigens, anti‑cytokine antibodies, agents for cleaving autoimmune antibodies and numerous combinations thereof. The RCTs covered by these patent applications operate through various mechanisms, including through induction of tolerance to self‑antigens, clearance of autoimmune antibodies from the bloodstream, clearance of cytokines from the bloodstream and inactivation of autoimmune antibodies. The patent applications also cover the use of these RCTs to treat a number of diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes, membranous nephropathy, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease and neuromyelitis optica.
 We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2035 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Cardio‑metabolic disorders intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCT compositions and their use in treating cardiac disorders and metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity heart failure, atherosclerosis and hemophilia. We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire in 2037, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Infectious disease intellectual property
 We own disease‑related patent applications directed to RCT compositions and their use in treating infectious diseases, such as a viral infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus or HIV) or a bacterial infection (e.g., bacteremia). We expect the patent 

 
  33
 
applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2037 and 2039 without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
 Platform‑related intellectual property
 In addition to the disease‑related intellectual property, our intellectual property portfolio also includes know‑how and patent applications directed to the RED PLATFORM and other technologies developed internally and exclusively in‑licensed from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or WIBR, that relate to the engineering and culturing of RCTs. Exemplary platform technologies that are the subject of such patent applications include:

· | methods related to the in vitro production of enucleated red blood cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | gene editing and transcriptional modulation systems for engineering RCTs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | targeted lipid nanoparticle compositions and RNA delivery techniques;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | amplifiable nucleic acid constructs for optimizing protein production;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | methods for chemically conjugating biotherapeutic proteins to cell surfaces; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | methods for increasing percent enucleation during RCT production.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

  These platform technologies, and our intellectual property protection related thereto, are broadly applicable to our RCT product candidates.
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including but not limited to Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Japan.
 Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product‑by‑product basis, from country‑to‑country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory‑related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Trademark protection
 As of February 29, 2020, our trademark portfolio contains approximately 52 registrations and pending applications. For the RUBIUS THERAPEUTICS mark, we have pending applications in the United States, Argentina, and Canada, registrations in Brazil and Hong Kong, and an International Registration designating Australia, China, the E.U., India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, S.

Under this International Registration, the mark is pending in all countries. Finally, we have a pending U.S. application for the RTX mark.
 Trade secrets
 We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know‑how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
 Licenses
 In January 2016, we entered into an exclusive license with WIBR that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under patent rights comprising two patent families to research, develop, make and commercialize products and processes covered by such patent rights for all uses, or the WIBR License. The WIBR License also includes an option for us to exclusively negotiate with WIBR for a license to certain improvement technologies related to the licensed subject matter. The WIBR License was amended in December 2017 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a third patent family jointly owned by WIBR and Tufts University, or Tufts. The WIBR License was amended in July 2018 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a fourth patent family owned by WIBR. As of February 29, 2020, the patent portfolio licensed from WIBR consists of two issued U.S. patents, and a total of 17 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and issued foreign patents. We expect these WIBR‑licensed patent applications, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions that may be obtained.
 The patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License are directed, in part, to the in vitro production of RBCs and the use of the enzyme sortase to conjugate a protein of interest to the cell surface. We have certain diligence obligations under the WIBR License, which include using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize any products under the patents and achieving certain milestones as further described in the WIBR License. Additionally, under certain circumstances, we may in the future be obligated to negotiate in good faith field‑limited, non‑exclusive sublicenses to allow third parties to exploit the patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License to develop and commercialize products that are not competitive with our products or product candidates.
 WIBR retains the right with respect to all four patent families licensed to us to (i) practice the patent rights licensed under the agreement for research, teaching and educational purposes, including sponsored research and collaboration, and (ii) grant non‑exclusive licenses to academic and not‑for‑profit research institutes to practice under the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes (excluding sponsored research), while Tufts retains such rights only with respect to the patent family that it co‑owns. Pursuant to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency agreement 

 
  35
 
between WIBR and a global biopharmaceutical company, the biopharmaceutical company funded research resulting in one of the licensed patent families and WIBR granted the right to retain a worldwide, irrevocable, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free right to use this patent family for research and development purposes. In addition, under the WIBR agreement, the U.S. federal government retains a royalty‑free, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to practice any government‑funded invention claimed in the patent rights, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §§ 201‑211 and Executive Order 12591.
 As partial consideration for the license, we issued 366,667 shares of our common stock to WIBR. In addition, we paid WIBR an upfront payment and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, creditable against royalties and milestone payments. We are obligated to pay to WIBR low single‑digit royalties based on annual net sales by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products and licensed services that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights at the time and in the country of sale. On a country‑by‑country basis, upon expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country, our license becomes royalty‑free, perpetual and irrevocable with respect to such country. Based on the progress we make in the advancement of products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are required to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are required to pay to WIBR a percentage of the non‑royalty payments that we receive from sublicensees of the patent rights licensed to us by WIBR. This percentage varies from low single digits to low double digits and will be based upon the clinical stage of the product at the time of the sublicense.
 Under the WIBR License, WIBR controls the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed to us and we have the right to review and comment on such prosecution and maintenance. We have the first right to enforce the patent rights licensed to us against third party infringers. We may terminate the WIBR License for convenience upon three months prior written notice to WIBR. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License upon written notice to us if we, along with our affiliates and sublicensees, cease to carry on business related to the WIBR License for more than six months. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License for our material breach that remains uncured for sixty days after receiving notice thereof, if we fail to pay amounts due under the agreement within thirty days after receiving notice of such failure, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patent rights.
 Competition
 In addition to the product specific competitors that are described for each of the initial targets we are pursuing, we have identified three companies that are leveraging the RBC as a platform. Erytech Pharma SA is using hypotonic enzyme loading to create products for use in cancer and immunology. The company has completed a successful Phase 3 program in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, recently failed a Phase 2 trial in acute myeloid leukemia, and completed a successful Phase 2 program in pancreatic cancer. We believe that there are fundamental challenges with hypotonic loading including:
· | The hypotonic loading process may be challenging to scale as it requires delivery of hypotonically loaded blood to the patient within 72 hours of acquisition of the blood. Thus, while not autologous, it suffers from many of the shortcomings of autologous therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Therapeutic interventions are limited to agents that can be loaded into, as opposed to expressed on, the cell surface of RBCs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are two other companies that rely on loading of mature RBCs: EryDel SpA is in late-stage development of dexamethasone loaded red blood cells for the treatment of ataxia telangiectasia and has declared a number of pre-clinical programs; and SQZ Biotechnologies is pursuing applications in cancer, enzyme replacement therapy and immune tolerance using a variety of cell-based approaches, including red cells. 
 Outside of RBC based competition, there are a number of companies competing in our target therapeutic areas. Within oncology, multiple large and small companies are developing novel immune stimulatory agents, such as NantCell, Inc., which is developing an IL-15 cytokine, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, which is developing a 4-1BB ligand. 

 
  36
 
Finally, many companies are developing therapies to generate antigen-specific immune responses against HPV positive cancers, such as BioNTech SE using RNA and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. using DNA-based therapy.
 In addition to the companies described above, we anticipate competing with the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, such as Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Amgen, Inc., F. Hoffman‑La Roche AG (Roche), Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer, Inc.
 Government regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as RTX‑240 and RTX-321, and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 U.S. biological product development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulations thereunder. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post‑market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The FDA categorizes human cell‑ or tissue‑based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial‑related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and, if applicable, current Good Tissue
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  37
 

Practices, or cGTP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biological product in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for RTX-240 and RTX-321 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical studies and IND
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety and toxicology studies.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold before such time. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. If the FDA’s concerns are not resolved, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Each clinical trial of investigational cell and gene therapies must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) for each clinical site. IBCs were established under the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules to provide local review and oversight of nearly all forms of research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. In its review, the IBC assesses biosafety issues, specifically, safety practices and containment procedures, related to the investigational product and clinical study. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Such trials remain subject to FDA and other clinical trial regulations, and only after FDA, IBC, and other relevant approvals are in place can these protocols proceed. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA or NDA. The FDA will accept a 

 
  38
 
well‑designed and well‑conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.

· | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease‑affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease‑affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit and risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post‑approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, among other things. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 BLA and FDA review process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, a request for approval to market the biological product for one or more specified indications, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well 

 
  39
 
as positive findings. Data may come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through December 31, 2020, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA or NDA, is $2,942,965. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2020 is $332,424. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non‑orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements and, if applicable, cGTP requirements. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their products with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and cGTP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data as part of the review process, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the process.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) or other significant and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A 

 
  40
 
REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre‑ and post‑marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post‑market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post‑marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 Orphan drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. A product will not be considered the “same drug” if it is clinically superior to a product that has orphan drug exclusivity. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication, but which could be used off‑label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.
 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre‑BLA meeting.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life‑threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life‑threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate 

 
  41
 
endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well‑controlled post‑marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post‑marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life‑threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive interaction and guidance from the FDA. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.
 Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval pathway for certain regenerative medicine therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative medicine therapies do not include those human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. The program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition.
 A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as an RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. The FDA generally expects preliminary clinical evidence to be obtained from clinical investigations specifically conducted to assess the effects of the therapy on a serious condition, which could include well‑designed retrospective studies or clinical case series, as appropriate, but the RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over existing therapies. Advantages of RMAT designation include all of the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. In addition, a product that receives RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review, and the FDA may grant accelerated approval to products that have RMAT designation based on (1) previously agreed‑upon surrogate or intermediate endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict long‑term clinical benefit; or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites, as appropriate. Another benefit of RMAT designation is that may enable to the sponsor to meet post‑approval requirements beyond the completion of traditional confirmatory clinical trials. The FDA has indicated that post‑approval requirements for RMATs receiving accelerated approval can potentially be met through:

· | Clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Post‑approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  42
 


· | As with breakthrough designation, an RMAT designation is not the same as an approval and does not change the statutory standards for demonstration of safety and effectiveness needed for marketing approval.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain BLAs and certain supplements to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial or trials that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed‑upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early‑phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 Post‑marketing requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record‑keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off‑label use”) and limitations on industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off‑label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 FDA regulations require that biological products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations and, in some cases, cGTP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP and cGTP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP and cGTP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP or cGTP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP and cGTP compliance. Other post‑approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, 

 
  43
 
potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.
 After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of RTX-240 and RTX-321 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Amendments. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent‑term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent‑term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA‑licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Bio similarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 A reference biological product is granted four- and twelve-year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case‑by‑case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA‑issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 European Union drug development
 In the E.U., our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the E.U. are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the E.U. clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the E.U., the E.U. Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the E.U. countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs.
 The E.U. clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of 

 
  45
 
clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation E.U. No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the E.U. will be identical.
 European Union drug marketing
 Much like the Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States discussed below, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti‑bribery laws of E.U. Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain E.U. Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and the regulatory authorities of the individual E.U. Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the E.U. Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 European Union drug review and approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of all 28 E.U. Member States (except Croatia) and also Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.

· | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced‑therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue‑engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the E.U.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk‑benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity
 In the E.U., new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the E.U. from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
 European Union orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 In the E.U., the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the E.U. community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 European data collection
 The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, in the E.U. is governed by, as of May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area, or the EEA, to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the E.U. Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the E.U. and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For more information related to GDPR, please see “Risk Factors—Risks related to government regulation—European data collection is governed by restrictive regulations governing the use, processing, and cross-border transfer of personal information.”
 Rest of the world regulation
 For other countries outside of the E.U. and the United States, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

 
  47
 

 Additional laws and regulations governing international operations
 If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
 Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non‑U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
 The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Successful commercialization of new drug and biologic products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug and biologic products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These bodies decide which drug and biologic products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug or biologic product. Sales of drug and biologic products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of these products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third‑party payors.
 In the United States, the important decisions about reimbursement for new drug and biologic products are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as major health insurers. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug and biologic products exists among third‑party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug and biologic products can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug and biologic benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs and biologics. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs and biologics, and each drug plan can develop its own formulary that identifies which drugs and biologics it will cover, and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include products within each therapeutic 

 
  48
 
category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs and biologics in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs and biologics may increase demand for products for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
 For a drug or biologic product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. Further, on December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a recent reimbursement formula change instituted by CMS under the 340B program. The HHS appealed the lower court’s decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on July 15, 2019. Pending review, it is unclear how this decision could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our products in the future, and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payors do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 These current laws and state and federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control as part of national health systems in many countries. In general, the prices of drug and biologic products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug and biologic products, but monitor and control company profits. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States.

 Other healthcare laws
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose a pharmaceutical or biologics manufacturer to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, false claims, physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below:

· | the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or biologic manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit receive, offer, provide or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward either referrals of individuals for, or the purchase, recommendation, arrangement, order or prescription of any good or service, including any particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violation of the statute does not require actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing such an obligation. Similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal anti-inducement law, prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the HHS under the Open Payments Program, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; and
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state and foreign anti‑kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug and biologic manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non‑compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, individual imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. In addition, commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely be subject to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
 In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court; the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business.

 
  51
 

 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point‑of‑sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” which will shift costs for name brand drugs away from Part D participants back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits in the event any of our products receive FDA approval and CMS reimbursement. Similarly, CMS recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Additionally, CMS has finalized a rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use pre-authorization, or PA, and step therapy, or ST, for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs, change the definition of "negotiated prices," and add a definition of "price concession" to the regulations. It is unclear whether these proposed changes we be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will continue into the future.
 Other Regulations
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In addition, our leasing and operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to certain U.S. environmental laws and regulations, under which current or previous owners or operators of real property and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination caused by hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases. Employees
 As of February 29, 2020, we had 223 full‑time employees and 186 of our employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be positive. Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters is located in approximately 85,000 square feet of office and laboratory space at 399 Binney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The lease term for approximately 48,000 square feet expires in January 2027 and the lease term for the remaining 37,000 square feet expires in August 2028.
 We own a 135,000 square foot clinical manufacturing facility located in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
 Legal proceedings
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
