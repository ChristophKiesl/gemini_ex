ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
We are a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products and paper. We own or operate some 40 facilities, as well as power generation assets in the U.S. and Canada. Marketing our products in over 60 countries, we have third-party certified 100% of our managed woodlands to at least one internationally recognized sustainable forest management standard.
Resolute Forest Products Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on January 25, 2007, from the merger of Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and Bowater Incorporated. Our common stock trades under the stock symbol “RFP” on both the New York Stock Exchange (or, the “NYSE”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (or, the “TSX”).
Products
We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products and paper.
Market pulp
As of December 31, 2021, we produced market pulp at five facilities in North America, with total capacity of 1.3 million metric tons, or 8% of total North American capacity. Our market pulp includes virgin pulp and recycled bleached kraft (or, “RBK”) pulp, for which we are a leading global producer. Approximately 80% of our 2021 virgin pulp capacity was softwood-based: northern bleached softwood kraft (or, “NBSK”) pulp, southern bleached softwood kraft (or, “SBSK”) pulp, and fluff pulp. The remainder of our virgin pulp capacity consisted of northern bleached hardwood kraft (or, “NBHK”) pulp and southern bleached hardwood kraft (or, “SBHK”) pulp. Pulp not converted into paper or tissue is sold as market pulp, which is used to make a range of consumer products including tissue, packaging, specialty paper products, diapers, and other absorbent products. Approximately 19% of our 2021 market pulp shipments were exported outside of North America, including significant exports to Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Following the announcement of the indefinite idling of the Calhoun (Tennessee) pulp and paper operations on December 16, 2021, and its subsequent idling in early 2022, we reduced our market pulp annual capacity by 147,000 metric tons for a total capacity of 1.1 million metric tons, or 7% of total North American capacity, produced at four facilities in North America. We no longer produce SBSK or SBHK pulp as of 2022.
Tissue
We produce tissue products at three facilities and convert at four facilities in North America. With total capacity of 128,000 short tons (116,000 metric tons), we operate four tissue machines and 14 converting lines. We manufacture a range of tissue products for the retail and away-from-home markets, including recycled and virgin paper products, covering premium, value and economy grades. We also sell parent rolls not converted into tissue products.
Wood products
We own 14 sawmills in Canada and three sawmills in the U.S. South. Our Canadian sawmills produce dimension spruce-pine-fir lumber and provide wood chips to our pulp and paper mills in Canada. Our sawmills also supply wood residue to our other segments to be used as fuel to produce electricity and steam based on renewable sources. Our U.S. sawmills produce dimension lumber and decking from southern yellow pine, and provide wood chips and other wood residue to third party pulp and paper mills and other end users. In 2021, we shipped 2 billion board feet of construction-grade lumber and decking.
We also operate two remanufactured wood products facilities that manufacture bed frame components, finger joints, and furring strips, two engineered wood products facilities that produce I-joists for the construction industry, and one wood pellet facility, all of which are located in Quebec and Ontario.
On February 14, 2022, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest in our engineered wood products facilities that produce I-joists, Resolute-LP Engineered Wood Larouche Inc. and Resolute-LP Engineered Wood St-Prime Limited Partnership, subject to certain closing conditions.
Paper
As of December 31, 2021, we produced newsprint and specialty papers at eight mills strategically located to serve major markets with a total capacity of 1.6 million metric tons. With approximately 6% of total worldwide newsprint capacity and 30%

Table of Contents

of total North American capacity, we are a leading global producer of newsprint. We sell newsprint to newspaper publishers worldwide and also to commercial printers in North America for uses such as inserts and flyers. In 2021, North American deliveries represented 68% of our total newsprint shipments, whereas international deliveries represented 32% across 55 countries. Our specialty papers comprised uncoated mechanical papers, including supercalendered paper and white paper, as well as uncoated freesheet papers. With approximately 27% of total North American capacity, we are the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America. Our specialty papers are used in books, retail inserts, direct mail, coupons, magazines, catalogs, bags and other commercial printing applications. We sell specialty papers to major commercial printers, direct mailers, publishers, catalogers and retailers, mostly in North America.
Following the indefinite idling of the Calhoun pulp and paper operations in early 2022, we reduced our paper annual capacity by 149,000 metric tons, for a total capacity of 1.5 million metric tons, produced at seven mills. 
For information on our corporate strategy, see Part II, 2 Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Our Business” of this Form 10-K.
Pulp, tissue, and paper manufacturing facilities
The following table lists the pulp, tissue and paper manufacturing facilities, and the number of machines we operated during the year ended December 31, 2021. The table presents our total 2021 production by product line (which represents all of our reportable segments except wood products), reflecting the impact of any downtime taken in 2021, and our 2022 capacity. Total capacity is based on an operating schedule of approximately 360 days. In certain cases, production can exceed capacity, due to changes in the manufacturing properties of the product.

(1)On December 16, 2021, we announced the indefinite idling of the Calhoun pulp and paper operations, resulting in a reduction of 147,000 metric tons for market pulp, and 149,000 metric tons for paper of the 2022 capacity, and a decrease of two machines. Pulp and paper operations ceased at the beginning of 2022.

(1)Resolute-LP Engineered Wood Larouche Inc. and Resolute-LP Engineered Wood St-Prime Limited Partnership are located in Quebec, and are equity method investments in which we have a 50% interest in each entity. We operate the facilities and our joint venture partner sells the products. The amounts in the above table represent the mills’ total capacity and production. On February 14, 2022, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest in each entity subject to certain closing conditions.
Other products
We sell green power produced from renewable sources and wood-related products to customers located in Canada and the U.S. Sales of these other products are considered a recovery of the cost of manufacturing our primary products.
We also have a 49% interest in Serres Toundra Inc., a joint venture that produces vegetables from 19 hectares of greenhouses adjacent to our Saint-Félicien pulp mill. The greenhouses source a portion of their heat from our Saint-Félicien pulp mill.
Raw Materials
In the manufacture of our market pulp, tissue, wood products and paper, our operations consume substantial amounts of raw materials such as wood and chemicals, as well as energy. We purchase raw materials and energy sources (to complement internal generation) primarily on the open market. These raw materials are market-priced commodities and as such, are subject to fluctuations in market prices. For additional information about commodity price risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk” of this Form 10‑K.
Wood
Our sources of wood include purchases from local producers, including sawmills that supply residual wood chips, wood harvested from government-owned land on which we hold timber supply guarantees or harvesting rights, and property we own or lease. In Quebec, under the Sustainable Forest Development Act, volumes are allocated through timber supply guarantees, which are five years in length and renewable, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we were allocated 4.5 million cubic meters of supply through the timber supply guarantees. In Ontario, we had long-term harvesting rights for 9.3 million acres of government-owned land, as of December 31, 2021. The harvesting rights licenses in Ontario are 20 years in length and automatically renew every five years, contingent upon our continued compliance with environmental performance and reforestation requirements.
We depend heavily on harvesting rights and timber supply guarantees over government-owned land in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. The volume of harvest permitted under these licenses is subject to limits, which are generally referred to as the 
 5


Table of Contents

annual allowable cut (or, the “AAC”). The AAC is reviewed regularly, typically every five years in Quebec and every 10 years in Ontario. The next AAC revision in Quebec is scheduled to take place in 2023 while Ontario has completed AAC revisions in 2021 for the forests in which we operate. Approximately 25% of the total allowable harvesting rights in Quebec are allocated through an open auction system. The prices generated by the auction system are used to set pricing for the remainder of the AAC. The timber requirements for our U.S. sawmills are met mostly by purchasing timber from timberland owners.
We strongly believe that it is possible to operate successfully with sustainable harvesting practices while maintaining biodiversity and protecting the forest, values important to a range of stakeholders. Consistent with that thought, we have sought out independent certification for 100% of the forests that we manage or on which we hold significant harvesting rights, in addition to the forest management regulations that we must abide with. The woodlands that we manage are all independently certified to at least one internationally recognized forest management standard: Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (or, “SFI”) and Forest Stewardship Council® (or, “FSC”). In 2021, we successfully maintained SFI forest management certifications for all of our managed woodlands in Quebec and Ontario. We also continued to maintain the FSC forest management certificates that we held in Quebec and Ontario. We continue to be one of the largest holders of SFI and FSC forest management certificates in North America.
To ensure that our wood fiber supply comes from acceptable sources, such as certified forests and legal harvesting operations, we have also instituted fiber-tracking systems at all of our North American facilities, with the exception of our three recently acquired sawmills in the U.S. South, which are expected to have their fiber-tracking systems certified in 2022. These systems are third-party certified according to one or more of three internationally recognized chain of custody standards, namely SFI, FSC, and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (or, “PEFC”). 100% of our wood and fiber sources are procured through the FSC Controlled Wood standard, the FSC chain of custody certification, the PEFC due diligence requirements, or the SFI fiber sourcing requirements, and in some cases a combination of these standards.
We strive to improve our forest management and wood fiber procurement practices and we encourage our wood and fiber suppliers to demonstrate continual improvement in forest resource management, wood and fiber procurement, and third-party certification.
Chemicals
We use various chemicals in our pulp, tissue, and paper manufacturing operations including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, liquid sodium hydrosulfite and sulfuric acid.
Energy
Steam and electrical power constitute the primary forms of energy used in pulp, tissue and paper production. Process steam is produced in boilers using a variety of fuel sources, as well as heat recovery units in mechanical pulp facilities. All of our pulp, paper and tissue operating sites generate 100% of their own steam requirements. In 2021, Alma, Calhoun, Coosa Pines, Dolbeau, Gatineau, Kénogami, Saint-Félicien and Thunder Bay collectively consumed 58% of their electrical requirements from internal sources, notably on-site cogeneration and hydroelectric dams. We purchased the balance of our electrical energy needs from third parties. As of December 31, 2021, we had six sites that operated cogeneration facilities and all of these sites generated primarily green energy from renewable biomass. Following the indefinite idling of the Calhoun pulp and paper operations, we now have five sites that operate cogeneration facilities.
We also have one hydroelectric generation and transmission network (Hydro-Saguenay in the Saguenay – Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec), which consists of seven generating stations with 170 MW of capacity. The water rights agreements required to operate some of these facilities typically range from 10 to 50 years. In some cases, the agreements are contingent on the continued operation of the related paper mills and a minimum level of capital spending in the region. For the other facilities, the right to generate hydroelectricity stems from our ownership of the riverbed on which these facilities are located.
Competition
In general, our products, other than tissue, are globally-traded commodities. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and, aside from quality specifications to meet customer needs, including designations to globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards, the production of our products does not depend upon a proprietary process or formula. Pricing and the level of shipments of our products are influenced by the balance between supply and demand as affected by global economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and freight costs. Prices for our products have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile.
As of December 31, 2021, we produced six major grades of market pulp (NBSK, SBSK, NBHK, SBHK, RBK, and fluff), for which we compete with a number of major market pulp producers, primarily with operations in North America. Market pulp

Table of Contents

being a globally-traded commodity, we also compete with other producers from South America (eucalyptus hardwood and radiata pine softwood), Europe (northern hardwood and softwood), and Asia (mixed tropical hardwood). Price, quality, service, fiber sources and freight costs are considered the main competitive determinants. Following the announcement of the indefinite idling of the Calhoun pulp and paper operations, we now produce four major grades of market pulp (NBSK, NBHK, RBK, and fluff). 
We compete with several major competitors in the North American tissue market. The key competitive attributes in this market include price, product quality, service, and customer relationships. Competition is also significantly affected by geographic location, as freight represents a material portion of the costs. We compete with branded and private-label products within North America.
We compete in North America with both large North American and numerous smaller local lumber producers in a highly competitive market. We also compete with European producers in the North American market during periods of favorable currencies and prices. Because there are few distinctions between lumber from different producers, competition is primarily based on price. Competition is also affected by cost and availability of wood, freight and labor. We have been required to pay cash deposits for estimated countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, since April 28, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the rates for such estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties were 18.07% and 11.59%, respectively. The U.S. Department of Commerce (or, “Commerce”) is expected to issue its final determination in the third administrative review of the countervailing and antidumping investigations in the third or fourth quarter of 2022, following which new rates will take effect for Resolute; these new rates were estimated at 15.48% and 4.76%, respectively, in a non-binding, preliminary determination released on January 31, 2022, but is subject to modification in the upcoming final determination. During any period in which our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products from our Canadian sawmills are subject to countervailing duty or anti-dumping cash deposit requirements or duty requirements, our competitive position could be materially affected. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Legal and Compliance Risks – We are subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders on the vast majority of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, which could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows,” of this Form 10‑K.
Our newsprint faces competition from both large global producers and numerous smaller regional producers. Price, quality, freight costs and customer relationships are important competitive determinants. In 2021, the five largest North American newsprint producers represented 87% of North American capacity, and the five largest global producers represented 31% of global newsprint capacity. Our uncoated mechanical and uncoated freesheet papers compete on the basis of price, quality, service, freight costs and range of product line against numerous worldwide suppliers. We compete with numerous uncoated mechanical paper producers, with the five largest North American producers representing 88% of the North American uncoated mechanical papers capacity, and the five largest global producers representing 51% of global uncoated mechanical papers capacity in 2021. 
As with other global commodities, the competitive position of our products is significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,” of this Form 10-K.
Trends in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect demand for traditional print media. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Strategic Risks – Developments in non-print media and changes in consumer habits regarding the use of paper are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for some of our products,” of this
Form 10-K.
Based on market interest, we offer a number of our products, including pulp and paper, wood and tissue, with specific designations to one or more globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards as well as product specifications to meet customers’ requirements. Our ability to conform to new or existing guidelines for certification depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes to the standards or the interpretation or the application of the standards; the collaboration of our suppliers in timely sharing product information; the adequacy of government-implemented conservation measures; and the existence of territorial disputes between Indigenous peoples and governments. If we are unable to offer certified products, for which demand is growing, or to meet commitments to supply certified products or meet the product specifications of our customers, it could adversely affect the marketability of our products and our ability to compete with other producers.
Sustainability
We recognize that the long-term future of our Company and the communities where we operate depends on the sustainability of the natural resources in our care and the performance of our operations. Our balanced approach to environmental, social and 
 7


Table of Contents

economic performance is aligned with the principles of the circular economy. This approach is focused primarily on four pillars:
•manage the resources in our care with the highest respect, seeking to differentiate the Company as an environmental supplier of choice;
•position Resolute as an attractive employer, one where employees learn, grow and succeed;
•engage, collaborate and drive sustainable economic activity with operating communities; and
•operate assets to the best of our ability to make the most of what we have, earning the right to be in business.
Resolute is committed to sound environmental management practices, including sustainable forest management and implementing environmental management systems. Placing increasing importance on sustainable practices and disclosure of sustainability performance is in line with our values and the expectations of the markets we serve. As part of our public reporting, we also set aspirational sustainability targets and objectives, and strive to achieve them.
We believe that delivering on our sustainability commitments makes us a more globally competitive company that generates value for shareholders over the long term. The health and safety of our employees is our first concern and responsibility – we are committed to providing employees with a safe and healthy working environment. Responsible environmental stewardship is both an ethical obligation and a business imperative, integral to our overall commitment to sustainable development. As stated in our code of business conduct, it is every employee’s responsibility to make environmental considerations a part of their daily decisions and actions.
The overall responsibility for our sustainability performance resides with our president and chief executive officer, while we rely on our sustainability committee to support the delivery of our key objectives and implement related plans. Our sustainability committee is a cross-functional group of senior managers from operations, sales, procurement, environment, human resources, finance and legal, among other departments. The committee’s mandate is to recommend strategies, set goals and measure results, oversee reporting and communications, ensure continuous improvement, and assess stakeholder expectations and sustainability trends. The committee is also charged with providing project oversight on the company’s key sustainability objectives.
The board of directors together with its environmental, health, safety and sustainability committee and its human resources and compensation/nominating and governance committee are responsible for overseeing the Company’s sustainability plans and strategies as well as the Company’s ESG performance. The environmental, health, safety and sustainability committee reports to the board on the sustainability performance of the Company, more specifically, the identification and management of risks and opportunities relating to environmental, health, safety and social matters.
To illustrate the importance of sustainability for Resolute, salaried employees have short-term compensation directly linked to specific ESG measures. In addition to performance metrics tied to Safety-Occupational Safety and Health Administration Rate, Safety-Severity Rate and Environmental Incidents, a new measure has been added for Resolute’s 2022 short-term incentive plan (or, “STIP”), namely the reduction of greenhouse gas (or, “GHG”) emissions. In total, 25% of the 2022 STIP target includes ESG measures.
Environmental and Other Regulated Matters
We are subject to a number of federal or national, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations in various jurisdictions related to environment, health and safety, and to some of our infrastructure, including dams and bridges. We believe our operations are in material compliance with these current applicable laws and regulations. While it is impossible to predict future laws and regulations that may be adopted, we remain committed to complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
For additional information, see Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies – Environmental matters,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Human Capital
We are guided by four core values: work safely, be accountable, ensure sustainability and succeed together. These values influence everything we do and help ensure Resolute’s continued growth and success. We have implemented several policies and procedures to ensure that everyone acts respectfully at all times and under all circumstances.

Labor Relations
As at December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,900 people, of whom approximately 4,000 were represented by various unions, primarily Unifor, and the Confederation of National Trade Unions (or, the “CNTU”) in Canada, and predominantly by the United Steelworkers International (or, the “USW”) in the U.S. In the past year, we renewed or entered into a number of agreements with unions, covering approximately 500 employees in Canada. Additional collective agreements covering approximately 2,000 employees in Canada are scheduled to expire in 2022, involving pulp and paper mills and sawmills.
Attraction and Retention
Our long-term competitiveness is tied to the ability to recruit candidates with key competencies, and develop and retain top-quality employees. We are committed to implementing new human resource practices to retain employees and renew our workforce. We are building a strong corporate culture that attracts results-driven and action-oriented employees and allows natural leaders to grow. In 2021, we hired 1,450 new permanent and temporary employees, raising our employer profile through targeted recruitment practices.
We assess 100% of salaried employees’ effectiveness through our performance appraisal process, which is focused on enhancing organizational capability through managerial accountability and people development.
Training and Development
While recruitment is important, we are equally committed to ensuring that our current employees are consistently motivated and engaged. Our human resources teams work hard to promote individual professional development goals, support sharing of knowledge and resources across the Company, and create opportunities for growth and learning wherever possible.
Through our program designed to develop emerging talent, we equip program participants to increase their self awareness and performance contributions, as well as strengthen their accountability and leadership skills and enhance their ability to reason on the basis of logic and data.
A leadership development framework is being prepared for implementation throughout 2022.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a core company value. We are committed to providing our employees with safe working environments, in addition to complying with applicable legal requirements at all our sites. Since 2015, our world-class Occupational Safety and Health Administration (or, “OSHA”) incident rate has been below 0.80, and we achieved an OSHA incident rate of 0.47 in 2021, which is one of the lowest rates within the North American forestry products industry.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a vigilance committee has been set up to collect and analyze continuous relevant information through the appropriate public health authorities where we operate, and more than 30 pandemic crisis management protocols have been implemented and maintained/updated in 2021, as well as implementing COVID-19 vaccination hubs in Quebec to ensure the safety and health of employees and contractors working at all our sites, helping to mitigate disruptions of operations.
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
We continue to train every new employee on Resolute’s code of business conduct and have in place a diversity policy designed to ensure equal consideration and opportunities to all employees. The first meeting of our diversity, equity and inclusion working committee took place in early 2022. Composed of employees from all our business segments and corporate, the working committee provides recommendations and input toward decisions on diversity, equity and inclusion projects and initiatives. Its members act as ambassadors within their business segment and throughout the Company. We are also identifying and implementing leading integration practices for temporary foreign workers, which include, for example, providing training to foreign workers to support them in their adaptation to local culture, as well as training Resolute employees to adapt to foreign workers’ arrival, and enable their professional and social integration.
In addition, the board has adopted a formal written diversity policy both at the board and executive levels. The board and the human resources and compensation/nominating and governance committee advocate diversity in the broadest sense, including diversity of experience, expertise and personal characteristics, such as the representation of men and women at the board level. Diversity is important because we believe a range of perspectives contributes to a more effective decision-making process.

Table of Contents

While maintaining the appropriate mix of skills and experience, reflecting the strategic needs of the business and the nature of the environment in which the Company operates, the human resources and compensation/nominating and governance committee shall actively seek out a broad pool of candidates for board positions from diverse ethnic, race, gender and cultural backgrounds. The board’s diversity policy is to strive to maintain at all times a minimum of 25% representation each of men and women as directors. Currently there are two women on the board representing 25% of its membership. The board has hired a recruitment firm to assist in its renewal process and in particular, in its search for women nominee candidates with a view to further increase women’s representation on the board to 30% by 2024.
