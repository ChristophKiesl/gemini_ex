The Company, formerly known as Cloudweb, Inc., formerly known as Formigli Inc., was a company in the development stages that planned to engage in the worldwide distribution of custom handmade Italian road bikes, made by Renzo Formigli. Amy Chaffe, who was the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, founded the Company. 
 
The Company and Ms. Chaffe decided to conduct a corporate restructuring. On December 3, 2015, Mr. Renzo Formigli resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.
 
On the same day, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Florida Department of State whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by (i) changing its name to “Cloudweb, Inc.”, (ii) increasing the Company’s authorized number of shares of common stock from 100 million to 500 million, and (iii) increasing the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock by conducting a forward split of such shares at the rate of 100 shares for every one (1) share currently issued and outstanding (the “Forward Split”).

Such shares sold by Ms. Chaffe represented 80% of the Company's total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, the purchaser of such shares, Mr. Zhi De Liao, arranged with Ms. Chaffe his appointment to the Company's Board of Directors and as an executive officer of the Company. Immediately thereafter, Ms. Chaffe resigned as a member of the Board. Mr. Zhi De Liao is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
The Company then completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Data Cloud Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Data Cloud”) from Mr. Liao pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued to Mr. Liao. Mr. Liao now holds 81% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
 
Data Cloud owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Web Hosting Solutions Ltd (“WHS”), which it purchased from James Holland for GBP 47,000.
