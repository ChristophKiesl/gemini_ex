Item 1. Business.
Overview
iBio, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “iBio”, “Ibio, Inc” or the “Company”) is a developer of next-generation biopharmaceuticals and pioneer of the sustainable FastPharming Manufacturing System ®. The Company is applying its licensed and owned technologies to develop novel product candidates to treat or prevent fibrotic diseases, cancers, and infectious diseases. The Company is using its FastPharming Manufacturing System (“FastPharming” or the “FastPharming System”) and Glycaneering Services TM to rapidly and cost effectively build a portfolio of proprietary biologic drug candidates. The Company is also using the FastPharming System to create proteins for others by contract or via the Company’s catalog.
The Company operates in two segments: (i) Biopharmaceuticals: which includes development and licensing in two business units: Therapeutics (focused on oncology as well as fibrotic and infectious diseases) and Vaccines (human and animal health vaccines), and (ii) Bioprocessing which includes Services (FastPharming, Process Development, Manufacturing, as well as Bioanalytical and other services) and Products (growth factors, lectins, and monoclonal antibodies) for research and further manufacturing uses, collectively known as Research & Bioprocess products (“RBP”): 
Biopharmaceutical Segment:
Therapeutics
Anti-Fibrotics
Fibrosis is a pathological disorder in which connective tissue replaces normal parenchymal tissue to the extent that it goes unchecked, leading to considerable tissue remodeling and the formation of permanent scar tissue. Fibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, including the lungs (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [“IPF”] and skin (e.g. systemic scleroderma [“SSc’].
SSc is a rare chronic disease of uncertain etiology characterized by rapid growth of fibrous tissue that leads to scarring and vascular abnormalities in the skin, joints, and internal organs. 
IPF is a type of chronic scarring lung disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function. As the disease progresses, the increased scarring leads to decreasing transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream, and ultimately, irreversible loss of lung function. The average life expectancy after an IPF diagnosis is 3-5 years.1  Because there is no cure and no therapy has been shown to halt or reverse the progressive deterioration of lung function, the primary goal of IPF treatment is to slow disease progression, maintain or improve quality of life, and prolong survival. Estimates have ranged from 2-29 people per 100,000 in the general population have IPF.
For both SSc and IPF, while there are medications that can slow the progression of specific existing symptoms or temporarily reduce the development of new symptoms. However, these existing antifibrotics do not stop or reverse progression, and for many patients, are poorly tolerated. Thus, there remains a need for better treatment options.
​IBIO-100
The Company’s lead anti-fibrotic candidate is IBIO-100, and its design is based in part upon work by Dr. Carol Feghali-Bostwick, Professor of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina and Vice-Chair of the Scleroderma Foundation. Her initial work was conducted at the University of

Pittsburgh, and we have licensed the patents relevant for the continued development of the molecule from the university. 
​
IBIO-100 candidates have been shown to be effective in animal models with both infusion and oral administration schemes, a novel aspect of a biotherapeutic protein of its type.2 Also, in preclinical studies, IBIO-100 has been shown to reduce: (i) bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice, as measured by hydroxyproline content and modified Ashcroft histopathology scoring; (ii) collagen content in mice in which fibrosis was produced by osmotic pump delivery of bleomycin followed by pump delivery of IBIO-100, and (iii) hydroxyproline content of human lung tissue obtained after transplant of diseased, terminal-stage organs. Tissue fragments exhibited a significant reduction of hydroxyproline when cultured in the presence of IBIO-100 after only 72 hours. We plan to finalize the selection of a lead molecule and initiate IND-enabling studies during FY 2022.
​IBIO-100 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for treatment of systemic scleroderma. 
​Oncology
There have been notable advances in the field of oncology in recent years, and arguably none more important than the advent of immunotherapies. The ability of iBio’s FastPharming System to produce monoclonal antibodies – and the Glycaneering Technology that can be used to make them more potent - positions iBio well to compete in the rapidly growing field of immuno-oncology. To that end, the Company announced plans in May 2021 to establish its own, organic drug discovery and development capabilities in the San Diego, California area, while also exploring opportunities to license new assets to add to iBio’s pipeline of therapeutics.
IBIO-101
In August 2021, the Company signed a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with RubrYc Therapeutics, Inc., (“RubrYc”) to develop and commercialize RTX-003, an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody [mAb]. In preclinical models of disease, RTX-003 has demonstrated the ability to bind and deplete immunosuppressive regulatory T [Treg] cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors. 
​
Targeting depletion of Treg cells to control tumors emerged as an area of interest in oncology over the past several years. Since Treg cells express interleukin-2 Rα (“IL-2Rα” or “CD25”), it was envisioned that mAbs could be developed that bind CD25 and thereby trigger depletion by Natural Killer cells, resulting in stimulation of anti-tumor immunity.
​
Unfortunately, while first-generation mAbs successfully bound CD25+ cells, they also interfered with interleukin-2 [IL-2] signaling to T effector [Teff] cells to activate their cancer cell killing effects. The result was a failure of first-gen anti-CD25 mAbs as cancer immunotherapies, since their favorable anti-Treg effects were negated by their unfavorable impact on Teff cells.
​
RTX-003 is a second-generation anti-CD25 mAb that potently binds and depletes Treg cells but doesn’t block the IL-2 signaling pathway to Teffs. Preclinical data show that an afucosylated version of the molecule is even more potent, but since RTX-003 was initially developed using traditional mammalian cell expression systems, a license from third parties for the afucosylation technology on that platform would be necessary. However, given studies in which we demonstrated that fucosylated and afucosylated RTX-003 produced using our FastPharming System - and enhanced with our Glycaneering Technology – had comparable performance to the mammalian system, we intend to switch to our more sustainable, plant-based manufacturing platform and advance the molecule as IBIO-101. Initiation of IND enabling studies is expected in calendar 2022.

RTX-003 stimulates anti-tumor immunity by depleting immunosuppressive Treg cells via engagement with Natural Killer [NK] Cells 
​
​Discovery Oncology
iBio has three oncology products in the discovery stage. All three products are antibodies that should benefit from iBio’s Glycoengineering Technology which enables afucosylation of the molecule to enhance antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”). Greater ADCC conveys greater potency for cancer cell killing effects. We expect the oncology pipeline to continue to grow via the Collaboration and Option Agreement with RubrYc, as well as the Company’s partnership with an antibody discovery firm Fair Journey (see Strategic Alliances, Collaborations, and Joint Ventures below for additional details). 
Vaccines:
Human Health: SARS-CoV-2
Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19” or “COVID”) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly precipitated by cytokine dysregulation, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.
The biopharmaceutical industry successfully and rapidly rose to the challenges of the COVID pandemic, delivering highly effective vaccines in record time. However, by the summer of 2021, many experts concluded that the COVID crisis is likely to be endemic to many regions around the world given the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants requiring ongoing management and responsiveness. As a result, numerous unmet vaccination needs remain:

◾ | Capability and capacity to address spike protein variants like Delta, for years to come
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | Greater durability via generation of memory T cells
--+----------------------------------------------------


◾ | Removing global barriers to access, including the high costs of many of the first-generation vaccines and cold-chain logistical challenges
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | “Fear of the needle” and other patient hesitancy
--+-------------------------------------------------

​We initiated preclinical work on vaccine designs that might overcome some of the challenges associated with the first-generation vaccines that target only the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we seek to design and 

3



develop a second-gen vaccine that addresses the current durability, access, and variant-inclusion challenges we still face.
 ​
IBIO-202
Produced in iBio’s FastPharming System, IBIO-202 is a subunit vaccine candidate that targets the Nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Since the N protein is abundantly expressed during infection, contains immunogenic epitopes and is more highly conserved than the spike (“S’) protein among the viral variants; new viral variants may be less likely to escape vaccine protection. IBIO-202 is adjuvanted to potentially allow for greater immunogenicity and/or dose sparing. An “N-only” vaccine may be highly complementary to existing first-generation, S protein-directed vaccines. 
​Initial pre-clinical studies of IBIO-202 demonstrated a robust, antigen-specific, memory T-cell response. Immunization data are consistent with that, as a strong, cytotoxic, memory T-cell response was seen, rather than an inflammatory response. In addition, T-cell priming was achieved via both intramuscular and intranasal administration, allowing for the further exploration of multiple routes of administration and their respective benefits.
​In September 2021, iBio submitted a pre-IND package for IBIO-202 with the intent to move its novel vaccine candidate into the clinic. Additionally, the Company recently filed four provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office related to the program. 
​
Animal Health: Classical Swine Fever
Classical swine fever (“CSF”) is a contagious, often fatal disease affecting both feral and domesticated pigs. Outbreaks in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America have not only adversely impacted animal health and food security but have also had severe socioeconomic impacts on both the pig industry worldwide and small-scale pig farming. Currently available vaccines can be efficient at triggering rapid animal immune response and protecting swine populations when combined with culling of infected pigs, but do not allow the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA), nor are they approved for use in the U.S. The development of DIVA compatible and efficacious vaccination solutions remains a top priority to prevent the economic impacts of a CSF outbreak including supply disruptions, export restrictions and reduced food security.
IBIO-400
In collaboration with the Institute of Infectious Animal Diseases at Texas A&M University and the Kansas State University, iBio used the FastPharming System to develop a potentially safe and protective DIVA-capable subunit vaccine3. 
The antigen is formulated in cost-effective oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants. IBIO-400 studies have shown that after single-dose vaccination, the adjuvanted, plant-made CSF E2 subunit vaccine provides complete protection in challenged pigs and is accompanied by strong virus neutralization antibody responses.
Further efficacy and safety studies are being planned using cGMP material. Also, efforts are underway to secure required United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) regulatory approvals for IBIO-400.

Bioprocess segment
Services:
iBio uses its proprietary FastPharming Expressions System and know how to develop or manufacture recombinant proteins on a contract basis for third parties, as well as to support our own biopharmaceutical development initiatives. iBio generated $2.4 million in revenue from its CDMO service offerings for the year ended June 30, 2021. Fiscal year 2021 revenue increased 50% over revenue of $1.6 million from the year ended June 30, 2020. iBio’s Services now include:
​

Process Development | Contract development and manufacturing, including: Feasibility assessment and development of manufacturing processes using iBio’s FastPharming Technology for optimized gene expression and purification parameters to meet client specifications for their active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”). Product optimization via iBio’s Glycaneering Services that may be used to enhance the quality and performance of therapeutic proteins with our plant-based glycosylation controls.
​ | ​ 
Manufacturing | Bioproduction using the FastPharming System. 
​ | ​ 
BioAnalytics | Method development and validation, including protein characterization using mass spectrometry.​ 
​ | ​ 
Factory Solutions | For the clients who seek to insource biologics manufacturing using the FastPharming System instead of outsourcing production to iBio CDMO, LLC. ​ 

We expect our Services business to deliver synergies with our Biopharmaceutical Segment, as in some cases it may allow us to identify in-licensing opportunities. Similarly, there may be opportunities for leverage with our Products business, as demonstrated by our relationship with Safi Biosolutions, Inc., in which we have the opportunity to selectively add certain recombinant proteins from that collaboration to our own catalog of products.
​Products: Research & Bioprocess
iBio is developing sustainably produced recombinant proteins for use in cutting-edge research and cGMP biomanufacturing where the demand for high-quality proteins is strong. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we launched our new e-shop and the first four research use-only [RUO] products in our RBP portfolio. We plan to continue to add new RUO products as well as proteins intended for further cGMP manufacturing use [FMU] over time. We expect to offer standard catalog products and accept custom new product requests for a variety of applications, including: 
​

- | Antibodies for use in drug manufacturing processes.
--+----------------------------------------------------


- | Cytokines and growth factors for cell culture applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


- | Proteins for use in the biofabrication of tissues and organs
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


- | Other biologics for use in a range of life science research, development, and bioprocessing applications
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our new RBP business may create synergies with our Services business, as the ready availability of catalog products facilitates lead generation for contract development or manufacturing services.
FastPharmingThe FastPharming System is iBio’s proprietary approach to plant-made pharmaceutical and protein production. It uses hydroponically-grown, transiently-transfected plants, (typically Nicotiana benthamiana, a relative of the tobacco plant), novel expression vectors, a large-scale transient transfection method, and other technologies that can be used to produce complex therapeutic proteins emerging from our own, our clients’ and our potential clients’ pipelines.
The FastPharming System offers several potential advantages versus traditional mammalian cell expression systems, including:

● | Speed: Shorter time-to-clinic with research and clinical-scale quantities of product in weeks versus months
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost-Effectiveness: No expensive, labor-intensive or costly mammalian cell line development
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality: Consistently high-quality recombinant protein production with the ability to enhance potency for some products with powerful glycosylation controls
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scalability: Each N. benthamiana plant is its own bioreactor, so scale-up issues are avoided by simply growing more plants
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Safety: Since mammalian viruses cannot replicate in plants, FastPharming-produced products avoid many of the risks associated with viral contamination events
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sustainability/Eco-Friendliness: Use of plants for the protein expression process avoids the single-use plastic disposables frequently used in large volumes with mammalian expression systems
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FastPharming System has been established in iBio’s 130,000 square foot facility in Bryan, Texas. The process begins with robotic seeding of iBio’s plants into an inert matrix for hydroponic cultivation under optimized LED lighting conditions. While the plants grow, FastPharming vectors carrying the genes encoding the desired protein product are developed and then loaded into a bacterial host (Agrobacterium tumefaciens). Then, the bacteria carrying the vectors and DNA for producing the desired protein are introduced into the leaves of the plants via an automated vacuum infiltration process. The vectors introduce the DNA into the plant nucleus, where it is coded into instructions that direct the plant’s own cellular machinery to make the desired protein. A specific arrangement of genes for plant viral enzymes causes these protein production instructions to be copied hundreds of thousands of times in each plant cell. Thus, as the plants continue growing for about another week, the gene transfer vectors combine the desirable features of the DNA mobilization plasmid, with gene control elements taken from single-stranded RNA plant viruses, to produce the encoded protein in abundance. With the target protein accumulated in the leaves, the plants are harvested, and the bulk drug substance is purified via traditional methods.

In the FastPharming System, no animal- or human-derived materials are used, decreasing the risk of product contamination with mammalian viruses or prions. In place of animal-origin raw materials, green plants, grown under clean and controlled conditions, provide for the expression of proteins. This portion of the bioprocess uses raw materials readily available to us, decreasing certain supply chain risks. 
By incorporating transient gene expression technology, the FastPharming System can rapidly deliver high quality proteins for clinical use without several of the time-consuming steps that competitive mammalian-cell based expression systems require, such as the need to i) isolate a high-producing cell clone from millions of non-productive cells, ii) establish a master cell bank, and iii) grow the clonal cells in a sterile fermenter to start the manufacturing process. This speed and cost advantage may allow iBio the opportunity to test more pipeline opportunities and generate results quicker than conventional approaches. In addition to saving months of development time associated than traditional production platforms, iBio believes that the use of plants as bioreactors may be more environmentally friendly than mammalian cell culture protein expression systems. Traditional protein expression systems require large volumes of water-for-injection [WFI] that is energy-intensive to produce. Also, many modern cell culture production systems rely heavily upon single-use plastic consumables for their operations. The combination may contribute to the finding that in 2015, the pharmaceutical industry’s emission intensity was about 55% higher than that of the automotive industry4. Given that our process, plants, which fix carbon, are at the heart of the process and the use of disposable plastics is minimized.
​
iBio seeks to continuously improve the FastPharming System via incremental and step changes in process to ensure additional advantages are incorporated as technology changes for bioprocessing.
Strategic Alliances, Collaborations, and Joint Ventures
iBio has formed collaborations and strategic alliances to gain access to funding, capabilities, technical resources and intellectual property to further its development efforts, commercialize its technology and to generate revenues, including through the development and manufacture of products at iBio’s FastPharming Facility.

10



technology to market as soon as practicable, consistent with sound and reasonable business practice and judgment, and to continue active, diligent marketing efforts for the licensed technology throughout the term of the Exclusive License Agreement. In addition, the Exclusive License Agreement sets forth specific milestone completion deadlines including filing an investigational new drug application by December 31, 2021, enrollment of first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial by March 31, 2022, enrollment of first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial by June 30, 2023, enrollment of first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial by June 30, 2026 and filing of a Biologics License Application or foreign equivalent by December 21, 2029. We are also required to meet certain diligence milestones. We are unlikely to file an investigational new drug application by December 31, 2021 so we have engaged in discussion with UP to extend the deadlines. We don’t know if or on what terms we will be able to extend the deadlines.
If we breach the Exclusive License Agreement and do not cure such breach within 30 days of receipt of notice, the UP may terminate the Exclusive License Agreement in its entirety. UP may also terminate the Exclusive License Agreement, effective immediately, if we file for bankruptcy, are dissolved or have a receiver appointed for substantially all of our property.
Planet Biotechnologies: ACE2-Fc
After reviewing our internal strategy, we have decided to terminate the partnership with Planet Biotechnologies, Inc. for the development of the recombinant ACE2-Fc protein as treatment for COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases. As part of our original agreement, no payments are due to Planet at the time of termination.

FastPharming Facility Joint Venture with Eastern Capital Limited 
iBio CDMO’s operations take place in Bryan, Texas in a 130,000 square-foot cGMP manufacturing facility controlled by an affiliate (the “Second Eastern Affiliate”) of Eastern Capital Limited (“Eastern”), a former significant stockholder of ours, as sublandlord (the “Sublandlord”). The facility is a Class A life sciences building located on land owned by the Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (“Texas A&M”) system designed and equipped for the manufacture of plant-made biopharmaceuticals. The Sublandlord granted iBio CDMO a 34-year lease for the facility that expires in 2050.
On December 16, 2015, we formed iBio CDMO as a Delaware limited liability company to develop and manufacture plant-made pharmaceuticals. On January 13, 2016, we entered into a contract manufacturing joint venture with an affiliate of Eastern (the “Eastern Affiliate”). The Eastern Affiliate contributed $15 million in cash for a 30% interest in iBio CDMO. We retained a 70% interest in iBio CDMO and granted iBio CDMO a non-exclusive license to use our proprietary technologies for research purposes and an exclusive U.S. license for manufacturing purposes. We retained the exclusive right to grant product licenses to those who wish to sell or distribute products made using our technology. On February 23, 2017, we entered into an exchange agreement with the Eastern Affiliate, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of the interest held by the Eastern Affiliate in iBio CDMO and issued one share of our iBio CMO Preferred Tracking Stock, par value $0.001 per share. After giving effect to the transaction, we own 99.99% of iBio CDMO. At any time, at our election or the election of the Eastern Affiliate, the outstanding share of iBio CMO Preferred Tracking Stock may be exchanged for 29,990,000 units of limited liability company interests of iBio CDMO. Following such exchange, we would own a 70% interest in iBio CDMO and the Eastern Affiliate would own a 30% interest.
See Notes 1, 15 and 16 in the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.
Commercial activities commenced in January 2016 with most of our initial efforts directed towards recommissioning the facility to help meet cGMP manufacturing standards and provisions for iBio’s service offerings. The facility houses laboratory and pilot-scale operations, as well as large-scale automated hydroponic systems capable of growing more than four million plants and delivering dozens of kilograms of protein per year

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.
We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies.
Our competition in the CDMO market includes a number of full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party development and manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.
While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for biologic product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies for the purposes of establishing license agreements. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.
We expect to rely upon licensees, collaborators or customers for support in advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional work with our collaborators during our efforts to commercialize our product candidates. Our licensees, collaborators or customers may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us. Agreements with collaborators may not preclude them from pursuing development efforts using a different approach from that which is the subject of our agreement with them. Any of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with a drug candidate under development by a customer.
There are currently approved vaccines and therapies for many of the diseases and conditions addressed by the product candidates our clients and collaborators may be developing or manufacturing or in our own pipeline. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities.

As a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on cancer therapeutics, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, our therapeutics can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. Our most significant competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Bausch Health Companies, NewLink Genetics Corporation, Agenus Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Advaxis, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., IMV Inc., Oxford BioMedica plc, Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., and others, some of which have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches.
Additionally, as we are developing IBIO-100 for Systemic scleroderma and for IPF we will face competition from several candidates that are either commercialized or in late-stage clinical trials. These candidates are sponsored by large, multinational biopharmaceutical companies with greater capital resources. Much like in the oncology space, we will compete with the likes of Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Gilead and BMS in big Pharma; while trying to beat out small biotechs such as Lung therapeutics, Veritex, and Horizon Therapeutics. These companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive, safer or more effective than those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete.
Specifically, with respect to the development of COVD-19 biopharmaceuticals, there are over 231 vaccines in various stages of development, and 612 therapeutics, according to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. Several of those candidates are in late-stage clinical trials and are sponsored by large, multinational biopharmaceutical companies, some of whom have also received government funding. There are also a number of companies working to develop new drugs and other therapies for diseases of commercial interest to us that are undergoing various stages of testing including clinical trials. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our technologies for commercial product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, price, and convenience. We have competition with the first to market companies such as Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca; while other big pharmaceuticals such as GSK and Sanofi continue to develop their late-stage drugs.
Research and Development
Our research and development functions are focused on the creation of new products and services, as well as enhancements to our existing offerings, both of which are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Our research and development activities take place primarily at our facilities in Bryan, Texas currently. However, iBio has subsequently announced it has leased lab and office space in San Diego for the purpose of conducting research.

Suppliers
We outsource certain functions and supplies to third parties such as Charles River Laboratories, Sartorius, Repligen, Cytiva, and Purolite. While we rely on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions, we are continuing to build internal capabilities. Our suppliers are generally available to meet our demands and supply requirements, but our items are long lead time items that have been exacerbated by the current macro environment due to increased demand. We continue to mitigate the risks through inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when possible. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a description of risks associated with our reliance on suppliers and outsourcing partners.Backlog
Our backlog consists primarily of orders for which we have entered into a Master Services Agreement with an accompanying Statement of Work (“SOW”). Our backlog was approximately $0.8 million as of June 30, 2021.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines.
U.S. Drug Approval Process
All of the vaccine and therapeutic products developed from our technologies will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations, also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of vaccines and pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of our product candidates, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed. Further, FDA approved vaccines and drugs are subject to ongoing oversight and discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use, or in their withdrawal from the market.
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application or NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the NDA or BLA based on results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidates are produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical trial and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensure of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Tests
Before any product candidates with potential immunization or therapeutic value may be tested in human subjects, we must satisfy stringent government requirements for preclinical studies. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. “In vitro” refers to tests conducted with cells in culture and “in vivo” refers to tests conducted in animals. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. Preclinical testing results obtained from studies in several animal species, as well as data from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. These preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical trials. In the case of vaccine candidates, animal immunogenicity and immune protection tests must establish a sound scientific basis to believe that the product candidate may be beneficial when administered to humans.
IND
An IND becomes effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA raises concern or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such an event, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials may proceed. For additional information on the most recent FDA regulations and guidance on vaccine and therapeutic product testing and approval, visit its website at http://www.fda.gov. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to potential safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
Clinical Trails
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations composing the good clinical practice requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials involving biological products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into a small number of closely monitored healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16




when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the targeted disease.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials generally enroll a large number of volunteers and are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted. 
Many other countries in which iBio might choose to develop drugs or run clinical trials have similar rules and regulation. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union or other foreign countries, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

Overall potential risks:
Although we are still in preclinical stages, we potentially could have some risks associated with commercializing a product. These risks include but are not limited to:

● | NDA/BLA:
--+---------


o | Once clinical trials of a product candidate are completed, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Approval Requirements: 

o | Any products for which we receive FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ‘off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirement: 

o | In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and similar state laws, each as amended. Once commercialized, we could be liable to ensure full compliance with the law. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

o | Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. This is dictated by third-party payors’ coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Foreign Regulation: 

o | In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18




and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orphan Drug Act
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Healthcare Regulations and Healthcare Reform
Healthcare regulation and pricing (included drug pricing) is complex, extensive, and dynamic around the world. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs. 
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.

19



We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. For example, it is possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
CDMO Regulatory Requirements
iBio CDMO’s operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent local and state agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Any failure to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions, or other future liabilities. iBio CDMO is also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and the handling and disposal of regulated material. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”), labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facility is subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions where our customers have marketing approval for their products. 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities. Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers’ products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization. 
Human Capital/Employees 
As of June 30, 2021 we had 18 employees in iBio and 57 employees in iBio CDMO, 49 of which are full time employees. Our employees are not represented by any union and are not the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that we will need to continue to add staff during Fiscal 2022 in order to meet our new growth objectives for Therapeutic, Vaccine, and Research & Bioprocess proprietary product development.
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research and development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory affairs, and iBio directly benefits from this experience and industry knowledge. 
We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully currently and will need to attract new talent to the organization in order to achieve its plans for growth.

Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan, whereby they may elect to make elective deferral contributions pursuant to a salary deduction agreement and receive matching contributions upon meeting age and length-of-service requirements. We will make a 100% matching contribution that is not in excess of 5% of an eligible employee’s compensation. In addition, we may make qualified non-elective contributions at our discretion.
