Item 1. Business
History and Background
 
In April of 2012, Nutriband Ltd. was established and registered in Dublin, Ireland, by CEO and founder Gareth Sheridan, to enter the health supplement market with new applications of transdermal patches for delivery of supplements. Initial market research was performed, and Nutriband Ltd. worked on the science of the patch and to develop three core products that would be effective and reliable for market testing: a multivitamin patch, an amino acid mix patch and finally an energy patch.
 
Having engaged a contract manufacturer in Asia to produce a small quantity of products to test the market, Nutriband Ltd. went to production and started to create sales accounts. By the end of 2012, Nutriband Ltd. had received small purchase orders from independent stores and distributors in Ireland. 
 
The year 2013 was a restructure phase; expenditures were made towards creating contacts for expansion internationally. In February 2014 Nutriband Ltd. signed a license and distribution deal with a Utah based company, Nutranomics Inc. Over the following eight months, efforts were focused on rebranding, reformulating and improving the products. In February 2015 Nutriband Ltd. was acquired by Nutranomics. The acquisition, however, was rescinded in November 2015 pursuant to an agreement by both parties, as terms of our agreement with Nutranomics were not met. According to the agreement signed with Nutranomics on January 26, 2015, Nutranomics agreed to issue Gareth Sheridan 5% of the total and outstanding shares of Nutranomics, which would had been about 3.2 million shares as of January 26, 2015. Subsequent stock issuances had the result of diluting Mr. Sheridan to well below 1%. In addition, Nutranomics had not, as it had agreed, developed Nutriband products from stage of acquisition, offered Mr. Sheridan a position in Nutranomics, or generated any sales of Nutriband products, as it was not in a financial position to produce Nutriband products or generate sales. The companies mutually agreed to rescind the January 26, 2015 acquisition agreement effective November 30, 2015.
 
Mr. Sheridan decided to completely restructure the approach to the marketing effort for the Nutriband products, and brought on our Chief Financial Officer, whose experience in the financial industry would assist the Company in raising investment capital and introducing and marketing our products to the nutritional supplement distributors, retailers and others in that market. In 2016 Nutriband Ltd. had raised limited working capital and was acquired by a newly-formed Nevada corporation, Nutriband Inc., in January 2016, from Gareth Sheridan in exchange for 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Nutriband Ltd. following the acquisition became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nutriband Inc. (Nevada) and we moved manufacturing and operations to the United States.
 
Following the acquisition of Nutriband Ltd. by the Company, all prior sales agreements, licensing arrangements and acquisitions entered into or under negotiation by Nutriband Ltd., have been terminated. In particular, we are no longer exploring the opportunity of a possible acquisition in Memphis. 
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company", “Nutriband”, "we," "our" and "us" refers to Nutriband Inc., and, as the context requires, its subsidiary Nutriband Limited.
 
Business and products
 
As at this time, the Company has not had any sales of its products, which are nutritional, cosmetic and therapeutic transdermal patches. The Nutriband product line initially consists of three transdermal patch products currently, with additional products under development. The basis of the product’s operation is that, once the product is applied, the ingredients will pass through the skin and release the product over a period of time. 
 
The initial products of Nutriband Ltd. were developed solely by Gareth Sheridan and were manufactured in China on a small scale to initiate a test market. The products are being redeveloped with U.S. based manufacturer in North Carolina. Product shape, density and quality has been improved along with packaging design and branding.
 
The product line currently consists of three products: an Energy Patch line, a Weight Management supplement patch line and a Multivitamin Patch line.
 
As to caffeine, an ingredient in our products, a test was conducted at Rutgers University to test the flow of caffeine through cadaver skin, with results as to amount of time and flow consistent what the Company had anticipated. The Rutgers test was carried out by our manufacturer.  We believe this test to be applicable to us, as our manufacturer’s ingredients and compounds were used and this test was provided to us by our manufacturer as proof of efficacy. There was no further formal testing of our dosage or time of delivery, and the Rutgers test provided a basis to forecast how our dosage would be delivered through our patch products. We have not conducted any further tests.
 
The caffeine dose in our products is based off similar products on the market and Global RDA allowances, staying within published safety limits, which are effective. Our patch has less caffeine that a can of Red Bull® energy drink. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion on the safety of caffeine, advising that single doses of caffeine up to 200 mg (about 3 mg/kg bw for a 70-kg adult) do not give rise to safety concerns. 
 
The Mayo Clinic has stated that ‘Up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two "energy shot" drinks.’ The FDA is in agreement with EFSA on caffeine intake being safe up to 200mg, as per the article on the FDA website, ‘medicines in my home, Caffeine and your body’.

For further ingredients in our patch formulation we based our decision on ingredients and levels of dosages of market competitors and what we deemed effective while also referring to recommended daily allowances in the US and EU.
 
No studies have been conducted internally; however, the Company has based the quantities of vitamins on government recommended daily requirements, as well as the medical suggested tolerable upper intake levels (UIL). Nutriband patches contain lesser quantities than what would be required to cause any health issue involving hypervitaminosis or other problematic results based on current medical institutional or governmental recommendations or practice, for example, the UIL for Vitamin D promulgated by the U.S. Institute of Medicine.
 
All product lines can be bought for a single application, and in five pack and thirty pack options.
 
The current range of Nutriband patches we have developed are all 1X3 inches in size and approximately 1 mm in thickness. Where applied on the body is up to the user; however, we will recommend areas of application in future manufacturing runs through a product insert. These include the shoulder, arm and torso. Sizes are subject to alterations in future as more products are added to the line.
 
Some Unique Features of Nutriband Products
 

● | Similar to a nicotine patch, the contents are absorbed slowly and continuously over extended periods of time. This avoids 'overdosing' of vitamins and other nutrients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Nutriband patch is small, discreet and simple to use. 
● | Only essential ingredients plus our proprietary delivery gel. No additives, flavorings, preservatives or other. 
● | Nutriband Patches are also completely vegetarian and vegan friendly, which cannot be claimed for similar capsule form supplements as gelatine is derived from collagen which is obtained from various animal by-products. 

Competition and Markets
 
Target Markets
 
The target market for the Company is the global supplement market and currently to a lesser extent, the therapeutic pharmacy and cosmetic markets. In the U.S., sales of vitamins and dietary supplements grew consistently from US$19.7 billion in 2009 to US$24.6 billion in 2013, according to Euromonitor International’s latest data.
 
In 2013 for Ireland and the U.K., the markets were valued at: UK - c. 700 million pounds Sterling; and
 
Ireland - 60 million euros.
 
"Healthcare reform, an aging population and growth in the number and variety of dietary supplements offered will boost revenue for the Vitamin and Supplement Manufacturing industry at an average rate of 4.5% annually, according to IBIS World, publisher of industry research.” (www.neutraceuticalsworld.com)
 
Our Market Strategy
 
Raw Materials, Production and Fulfillment
 
We are currently using a third party manufacturer, Pocono Coated Products, Cherryville, North Carolina, but plan, if the markets for our products develop and we have sufficient capital, to use facilities around the world to ensure that production will continue in the event of a disturbance in operation at any given location, and to source some of our raw materials directly. All raw materials are sourced by our contract manufacturer in N. Carolina through their list of suppliers. We do not deal directly with the raw material suppliers and believe that the raw materials used in our products are widely available from a large number of sources. Our manufacturer does not have a FDA CGMP certificate; however, they advise us that the facility is completely compliant with FDA regulations for manufacturing our current range, and have been inspected by the FDA resulting in comments for certain improvements, which were carried out.
 
We have not yet formalized an agreement with our manufacturer governing the business terms of the manufacture by them of our products. We are currently operating under a business arrangement under which Pocono produces our products to order. We will be negotiating a manufacturing agreement once we are more established which will outline pricing, lead times, late penalties, quality assurances and payment terms. We currently have a written agreed pricing structure through email only. We have not yet set up a schedule for negotiation of a manufacturing agreement, but plan to do this in the near future. There is no assurance that our arrangement with the manufacturer, for production of our products and acquisition of the necessary raw materials, will continue on satisfactory terms to us until we formalize the arrangements in an agreement.
 
At this time, we are substantially dependent on this manufacturer and have a quality control agreement the manufacturer as of July 19, 2016, which agreement sets out responsibilities for both parties for quality control. Prior to this date we did have not had any agreement in place.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The highly fragmented, competitive nature of the nutritional supplement market makes sales and marketing efforts within the sector largely relationship driven. We are currently selling our products to customers through our website and plan to use direct marketing to wholesalers and distributors, so that we establish a network of retail distributors as well as an online customer base.

We also plan to use the social media to promote our products, multiple times daily, through Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and other social media sites. Through this medium we are able to obtain referral customers, new customers, and educate our customers.
 
The third tool is email campaigns. We plan to utilize email to our customer lists for newsletters, pricing updates, and promotional offers.
 
The Company has marketing contacts through the various distributors we have contacts with. We plan to budget to ensure SEO placement (favorable and higher ranking appearance on search engines so as to generate more traffic) for online presence. Samples have been sent to a number of distributors with positive feedback; however, no distribution agreements have been requested or offered.
 
We plan to participate in industry conferences and expos, and to seek endorsements from athletes and other known celebrities. There are no assurances that such endeavors will be successful and will materialize in distribution agreements or any other agreements.
 
Competition
 
The U.S. and international nutritional supplements retail industry is a large, highly fragmented and growing industry, with no single industry participant accounting for a majority of total industry retail sales. We believe competition is based on price, quality and assortment of products, customer service, marketing support and availability of new products. In addition, the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products.
 
Virtually all of our competitors have had longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do.  In order for us to successfully compete in our industry, we will need to raise additional capital, develop our brand, leverage our management’s contacts and business experience to develop a wider customer base, develop a comprehensive marketing system for retail clients, and increase our financial resources.
 
We compete with shots, nutrition shakes, supplement pills, supplement capsules, and dissolvable multivitamins. Some key players in this area are Patch MD, Le-Vel, 5 Hour Energy, Berocca and Red Bull.
 
The above brands have all established themselves as key brands in the area of supplemental nutrition although much of their product ingestion diversification is very minimum therefore we believe leaving the gap open for Nutriband to exploit. As seen previously almost half of supplement users are open to new methods of ingestion due to reasons such as taste quality or hassle or pill swallowing complications.
 
However, there can be no assurance that even if our products gain market acceptance, that we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. As we are a relatively small company, we face the same problems as other small companies in any industry, including the lack of available funds, lack of established distribution channels or large customer base. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
The manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA. Advertising and other forms of promotion and methods of marketing are subject to regulation primarily by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, which regulates these activities under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA. The FTC and the FDA work together under a division of responsibilities between the two agencies. As applied to dietary supplements, the FDA has primary responsibility for claims on product labeling, including packaging, inserts, and other promotional materials distributed at the point of sale. The FTC has primary responsibility for claims in advertising, including print and broadcast ads, infomercials, catalogs, and similar direct marketing materials. The foregoing matters regarding our products are also regulated by various state and local agencies as well as those of each foreign country in which we would distribute our products.
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA") amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDC Act") to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Dietary supplements are defined, in part, as products (other than tobacco products) taken by mouth that contain a "dietary ingredient", i.e., products intended for ingestion (meaning oral consumption) in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, or liquid form or, if not intended for ingestion in such a form, are not represented as conventional food and not represented for use as a sole item of a meal or of the diet. Transdermal patches would not fall under this definition of dietary supplement, and nicotine patches are specifically allowed under the FDA rules.
 
Dietary ingredients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbs or botanicals, as well as other substances that can be used to supplement the diet. Federal law requires that every dietary supplement be labeled as such, either with the term "dietary supplement" or with a term that substitutes a description of the product's dietary ingredient(s) for the word "dietary" (e.g., "herbal supplement" or "calcium supplement"). Federal law does not require dietary supplements to be proven safe to FDA's satisfaction before they are marketed.

Generally, under the FDC Act, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. "New" dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were "not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994") must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been "present in the food supply as an article used for food" without being "chemically altered." A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a "history of use or other evidence of safety" establishing that use of the dietary ingredient "will reasonably be expected to be safe." A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient.
 
To date, our products have not had “new” ingredients in accordance with FDA regulations and guidance so as to require notification to FDA; however, if notification would be required as to any future ingredients proposed to be used, we would incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, enjoining the manufacturing of our products until the FDA determines that we are in compliance. 
 
FDA monitors drug manufacturers' compliance with its Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations.  The CGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product.  The regulations make sure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. The approval process for new drug and generic drug marketing applications includes a review of the manufacturer's compliance with the CGMP.  FDA inspectors determine whether the firm has the necessary facilities, equipment, and skills to manufacture the new drug for which it have applied for approval. Decisions regarding compliance with CGMP regulations are based upon inspection of the facilities, sample analyses, and compliance history of the firm. This information is summarized in reports which represent several years of history of the firms.
 
FDA can issue a warning letter or initiate other regulatory actions against a company that fails to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations.  Failure to comply can also lead to a decision by FDA not to approve an application to market a drug. The FTC has taken action not just against supplement manufacturers, but also, in appropriate circumstances, against ad agencies, distributors, retailers, catalog companies, infomercial producers and others involved in deceptive promotions.
 
Our contract manufacturer is aware of FDA guidelines for labeling, packaging and product regulation, and we rely primarily on our manufacturer for the compliance of our products with FDA manufacturing requirements.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two executive employees, our CEO and CFO.
