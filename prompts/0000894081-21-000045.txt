ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Air Transport Services Group, Inc. leases aircraft and provides airline operations, ground handling services, aircraft modification and maintenance services, and other support services to the air transportation and logistics industries. We are a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation services in the United States and internationally. In addition, we are the largest provider of passenger charter service to the United States Department of Defense (“DoD”) and other governmental agencies. Our portfolio of freighter aircraft is focused on mid-sized air freighters, which is the category of choice for express and e-commerce driven regional air networks operating both within and outside the United States. Our freighter fleet is primarily Boeing 767 aircraft, which are in high demand because of their reliability, cubic cargo capacity and durable performance. (When the context requires, we may use the terms “Company,” "we," "our" and “ATSG” in this report to refer to the business of Air Transport Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.) 
Our customers consist of e-commerce companies, air express integrators, freight forwarders, airlines and governmental agencies. Our ability to offer our customers a bundle of customized and differentiated services, including aircraft leasing, airline express operations, line and heavy maintenance, freighter conversions, material handling equipment and ground handling services makes us unique from other service providers in the air transportation industry. Through our decades of experience with express network airline operations, we offer best-in-class, reliable services to customers including Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. and its affiliates (“DHL”), and United Parcel Service in addition to the DoD.
Our strategy targets opportunities primarily for medium range and medium capacity airlift by investing in the acquisition of used passenger aircraft. We convert most of these aircraft to a freighter configuration, where upon we lease the converted freighters to customers for operations in specific networks and regional geographies. We manage the conversion of passenger aircraft into freighters and bring freighter aircraft to market leveraging our decades of experience as an airline. As a result, the aircraft can be deployed into regional markets more economically than larger capacity aircraft, newly built aircraft or other competing alternatives. We customize the interiors of our passenger aircraft for the DoD and commercial customers. In 2017, we launched a joint venture to convert Airbus A321 passenger aircraft into freighters, which is intended to further support our ability to meet the growing demand worldwide for narrow body air freighters. We modify our level of investment in growth assets based on our perception of strength in market demand. 
We are unique in our ability to offer a broad range of integrated, operational solutions to air cargo and express package transportation companies and e-commerce companies, as well as charter passenger transport to governmental and commercial entities. We have extensive experience in the express business. We know what it takes to run a highly reliable air network and leverage our experience to help our customers with reliable on-time service. Our charter operations maintain high availability and short advance times to perform missions around the world. We also offer a broad range of ancillary services including engineering services, sort and gateway operations, equipment installation, maintenance and leasing, and aircraft modifications which are tailored to the needs of the customers. The breadth of integrated, complementary services we offer to customers distinguishes us from other leasing and airline service companies and gives us a competitive advantage in our industry. 
We have become a leader in an industry with established barriers to entry, possessing reliable airlift capability, and strategic alignment with our key customers since being founded in 1980 as a airline subsidiary of Airborne Express. We became an independent, publicly-owned company in August 2003, as a result of a spin-off by Airborne Express prior to its acquisition by DHL. The spin-off was necessitated in large part due to restrictions imposed by federal law on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines. Our headquarters are located at the Wilmington Air Park in Wilmington, Ohio, which also serves as a regional air hub for Amazon. Our common shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol ATSG. 
Principal Services
Our principal services fall into three general categories:
Aircraft leasing. We own and lease aircraft through our subsidiary, Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. (“CAM”). We are able to provide competitive lease rates for our cargo freighters by purchasing passenger aircraft, typically 15 to 20 years old, and converting them into cargo freighters, after which we anticipate an economic life of 20 years or more. We monitor the global market for available passenger aircraft and only purchase aircraft for conversion that meet our requirements for condition and technical specifications and that can be purchased and converted into freighters at a price that will meet or exceed our targeted return on capital. Aircraft freighters that are converted from passenger aircraft can be deployed into markets more economically in comparison to newly-built freighters.
Aircraft operations. We own and operate three separate airline subsidiaries: ABX Air, Inc. (“ABX”), Air Transport International, Inc. (“ATI”), and Omni Air International, LLC (“OAI”). Each of these airlines is independently certificated by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and by the Federal Aviation Administration, ("FAA"), a constituent agency of the DOT. Our airline subsidiaries offer different combinations of aircraft, crews, maintenance and insurance to provide customized transportation capacity to our customers. We specialize in carrying both freight and passengers for a variety of customers, including private sector companies and governmental organizations. ABX operates all-cargo aircraft; ATI operates all-cargo and passenger/freighter combination ("combi") aircraft; and OAI operates passenger aircraft.
Support services. We provide a wide range of air transportation related services to our customers including aircraft maintenance and modification, ground handling and crew training. We offer these support services to delivery companies, e-commerce companies, freight forwarders and other airlines. Our ground support services, which are provided through our subsidiary, LGSTX Services, Inc. (“LGSTX”), consist of load transfer and sorting, the design, installation and maintenance of material handling equipment, the leasing and maintenance of ground support equipment, and general facilities maintenance. LGSTX has more than 30 years of experience in material handling, facilities maintenance, equipment installation and maintenance, vehicle maintenance and repair, and jet fuel and deicing services. Our aircraft maintenance and modification services, which are provided by our subsidiaries, Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc. (“AMES”) and Pemco World Air Services, Inc. (“Pemco”), provide airframe modification and heavy maintenance, component repairs, engineering services and aircraft line maintenance. Another subsidiary, AMES Material Services, Inc. ("AMS"), resells and brokers aircraft parts. Our support services also involve the training of flight crews, which we offer through our subsidiary, Airborne Training Services, Inc. ("ATS").
The business development and marketing activities of our operating subsidiaries are supported by our Airborne Global Solutions, Inc. ("AGS") subsidiary. AGS markets the various services and products offered by our subsidiaries by bundling solutions that leverage the entire portfolio of our subsidiaries' capabilities and experience in global cargo operations. Our bundled services are flexible and scalable to complement our customers' own resources and support our operational growth. AGS assists our subsidiaries in achieving their sales and marketing plans by identifying their customers' business and operational requirements while providing sales leads. 
For additional financial information about our operating segments see Note O of the accompanying audited financial statements. 
Major Customers
We have long-standing, strategic customer relationships with Amazon, DHL and the DoD in addition to numerous other companies and government agencies that rely on aircraft services in their operations.
U.S. Department of Defense. Our airline subsidiaries have been providing services to the DoD since the 1990’s. The DoD comprised 31% of our consolidated revenues for 2020. Our business with the DoD and other government agencies expanded significantly as a result of our November 2018 acquisition of OAI, which is discussed below.
Amazon. We have been providing freighter aircraft and cargo handling and logistics support services to Amazon.com Services, LLC (“ASI”), the successor to Amazon.com Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon, since September 2015. Revenues from our commercial arrangements with ASI comprised approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues for 2020. Our CAM subsidiary has leased 31 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to ASI as of 
December 31, 2020, with eleven additional aircraft to be leased in 2021. We also provide flight crew and aircraft maintenance services for those aircraft under an Air Transportation Services Agreement with ASI.
DHL. We have provided aircraft services to DHL under multi-year contracts since August 2003. DHL accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues for 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we were leasing 14 of our Boeing 767 aircraft to DHL under multi-year contracts. We operate eight of these aircraft for DHL under a separate operating agreement. We provide ground equipment and maintenance services to DHL in the U.S.
Business Development 
On November 9, 2018, we acquired OAI, a passenger airline, along with related entities Advanced Flight Services, LLC; Omni Aviation Leasing, LLC; and T7 Aviation Leasing, LLC (referred to collectively herein as "Omni"). OAI is a leading provider of contracted passenger airlift for the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") via the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ("CRAF") program, and a provider of full-service passenger charter and ACMI services. OAI carries passengers worldwide for a variety of private sector customers and other government services agencies.  The addition of Omni expanded our customer solution offerings primarily through additional passenger transportation capabilities and the authority to operate Boeing 777 aircraft. The acquisition increased the Company's revenues, cash flows and customer diversification. (Additional information about the acquisition of Omni is presented in Note B to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
In September 2015, we began to operate a trial air network for ASI. We provided cargo handling and logistical support as the network grew to five dedicated Boeing 767 freighter aircraft during 2015. 
On March 8, 2016, we entered into an Air Transportation Services Agreement (the “ATSA”) with ASI pursuant
to which CAM leased 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to ASI, including 12 Boeing 767-200 freighter aircraft for a term of five years and eight Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft for a term of seven years. The ATSA also provided for the operation of those aircraft by our airline subsidiaries for a term of five years, and the performance of ground handling services by our subsidiary, LGSTX Services Inc. ("LGSTX").
In December 2018, the Company announced agreements with Amazon to (1) lease and operate ten additional Boeing 767-300 aircraft for ASI, (2) extend the term of the 12 Boeing 767-200 aircraft currently leased to ASI by two years to 2023 with an option on the part of ASI to extend the lease term for three more years, (3) extend the term of the eight Boeing 767-300 aircraft currently leased to ASI by three years to 2026 and 2027 with an option on the part of ASI to extend the lease term for three more years and (4) extend the ATSA by five years through March 2026, with an option on the part of ASI to extend the term for an additional three years. In January 2019, we entered into lease amendments which formalized the lease extensions described in (2), (3) and (4) above. As of December 31, 2020, we had executed leases with ASI for all ten of these Boeing 767-300 aircraft and we were operating them under the ATSA. 
On May 29, 2020, Amazon agreed to lease twelve more Boeing 767-300 aircraft from the Company. The first of these leases began in the second quarter of 2020 with the remaining eleven to be delivered in 2021. All of these additional Boeing 767-300 aircraft leases will be for ten years. We expect all of these aircraft will be operated under the ATSA.
In conjunction with the execution of the ATSA, the Company and Amazon entered into an Investment Agreement and a Stockholders Agreement on March 8, 2016. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Company issued warrants in three tranches granting Amazon the right to acquire up to 19.9% of the Company’s pre-transaction outstanding common shares measured on a GAAP-diluted basis, adjusted for share issuances and repurchases by the Company following the date of the Investment Agreement and after giving effect to the warrants granted. These warrants, which total 14.9 million common shares for all three tranches, are fully vested, have an exercise price of $9.73 per share and will expire on March 8, 2021, unless Amazon has not obtained by such date all regulatory approvals, exemptions, authorizations, consents or clearances (including the expiration or termination of any waiting periods) required to purchase the shares underlying such warrants, in which case the expiration date is extended.
In conjunction with Amazon's commitment for ten additional Boeing 767-300 aircraft leases, extensions of twenty existing Boeing 767 aircraft leases and additional aircraft operations under the ATSA, Amazon and the Company entered into a new investment agreement on December 20, 2018 (the "2018 Investment Agreement"). Pursuant to the 2018 Investment Agreement, the Company issued additional warrants to Amazon for 14.8 million 
common shares, all of which had vested as of December 31, 2020 in conjunction with the leases and operation of the aircraft under the ATSA. These warrants have an exercise price of $21.53 per share and will expire if not exercised December 20, 2025, subject to extension if all regulatory approvals, exemptions, authorizations, consents or clearances have not been obtained by such date.
In conjunction with Amazon's commitment in May of 2020 to lease twelve additional Boeing 767-300 aircraft, Amazon was issued warrants for 7.0 million common shares, pursuant to the 2018 Investment Agreement, of which 0.6 million common shares have vested as of December 31, 2020. These warrants will expire if not exercised by December 20, 2025, subject to extension if all regulatory approvals, exemptions, authorizations, consents or clearances have not been obtained by such date. The exercise price of these warrants is $20.40 per share.
Additionally, Amazon can earn incremental warrant rights under the 2018 Investment Agreement by leasing up to five more cargo aircraft from the Company before January 2026. Incremental warrants granted for Amazon’s commitment to any such future aircraft leases will have an exercise price based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the contractual commitment for each lease.
Through the 2016 and 2018 Investment Agreements, Amazon can potentially own approximately 39.9% of the Company if all issued and issuable warrants vest and are settled with cash. For all warrants vested, Amazon may select a cash exercise option or a cashless exercise option. Assuming ATSG’s stock price at the time of exercise is above the warrant exercise price, Amazon would receive fewer shares in exchange for any warrants exercised under the cashless option. Instead, Amazon would receive the number of ATSG shares equivalent in market value at the time of exercise to the appreciation above the exercise price of the warrants.
We have had multi-year contracts with DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. and its affiliates ("DHL") since August 2003. In 2010, we entered into commercial agreements with DHL under which DHL leased thirteen Boeing 767 freighter aircraft from CAM and ABX operates those aircraft under a separate crew, maintenance and insurance agreement. Effective April 1, 2015, the Company and DHL amended and restated the agreements (together, the "CMI agreement") which extended the Boeing 767 aircraft lease terms and the operation of those aircraft through March 2019. In March 2019, the expiring Boeing 767 aircraft leases and CMI agreement with DHL were renewed under terms similar to the previous agreements. On April 30, 2019, we extended the leases for four of the 767-300 aircraft and one of the 767-200 aircraft leased to DHL through April 2022.
Through CAM and the acquisition of Omni, we have expanded our combined fleet of Boeing 777, and 767 aircraft in recent years. Since the beginning of 2016, CAM has managed the modification of 39 Boeing 767-300 passenger aircraft to a freighter configuration and acquired two Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. CAM added two Boeing 767-200 passenger aircraft, six Boeing 767-300 passenger aircraft and three Boeing 777-200 passenger aircraft through the Company's acquisition of Omni on November 9, 2018. We have agreements to acquire 13 more Boeing 767-300 extended-range aircraft, ten of which we anticipate being delivered during 2021 and the remaining three in 2022. Most, if not all, of these will be converted into freighters. Additionally we own eight Boeing 767-300 aircraft that were being prepared for cargo service as of December 31, 2020. A complete list of the Company's aircraft is included in Item 2, Properties. 
On February 1, 2019, we acquired a group of companies under common control, referred to as TriFactor. TriFactor resells material handling equipment and provides engineering design solutions for warehousing, retail distribution and e-commerce operations. TriFactor is managed through our LGSTX business. 
On August 3, 2017, we entered into a joint-venture agreement with Precision Aircraft Solutions, LLC, to develop a passenger-to-freighter conversion program for Airbus A321-200 aircraft. We anticipate approval of an FAA supplemental type certificate in March of 2021. We expect to make contributions equal to our 49% ownership percentage of the program's total costs over the next year and account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
In December 2016, we acquired Pemco. Pemco provides aircraft maintenance, modification, and engineering services. Pemco is based at the Tampa International Airport where it operates a two-hangar aircraft facility of 311,500 square feet. Pemco is a leading provider of passenger-to-freighter conversions for Boeing 737-300 and 737-400 aircraft, having redelivered over 50 Boeing 737 converted aircraft to Chinese operators over ten years. Pemco's aircraft conversion capabilities and aircraft hangar operations are marketed with our other air transportation support services.
We seek to take advantage of business acquisition opportunities of complementary and adjacent businesses that enhance or extend our current value proposition or, alternatively, diversify our customer base. 
Description of Businesses
CAM
CAM leases aircraft to ATSG's airlines and to external customers, including DHL and ASI, usually under multi-year contracts with a schedule of fixed monthly payments. Under a typical lease arrangement, the customer maintains the aircraft in serviceable condition at its own cost. At the end of the lease term, the customer is typically required to return the aircraft in approximately the same maintenance condition that existed at the inception of the lease, as measured by airframe and engine time and cycles since the last scheduled maintenance event. CAM examines the credit worthiness of potential customers, their short and long-term growth prospects, their financial condition and backing, the experience of their management, and the impact of governmental regulation when determining the lease rate that is offered to the customer. In addition, CAM monitors the customer’s business and financial status throughout the term of the lease. 
ACMI Services
ACMI Services consists of the operations of the Company's three airline subsidiaries. Through these airlines, we provide airlift operations to DHL, ASI, the DoD and other transportation customers. A typical operating agreement requires our airline to supply, at a specific rate per block hour and/or per month, a combination of aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance for specified transportation operations. These services are commonly referred to as ACMI, CMI or charter services depending on the selection of services contracted by the customer. The customer bears the responsibility for capacity utilization and unit pricing in all cases. 
ACMI - The airline provides the aircraft, flight crews, aircraft maintenance and aircraft hull and liability insurance while the customer is typically responsible for substantially all other aircraft operating expenses, including fuel, landing fees, parking fees and ground and cargo handling expenses. 
CMI -The customer is responsible for providing the aircraft, in addition to the fuel and other operating expenses. The airline provides the flight crews, aircraft hull and liability insurance and typically aircraft line maintenance as needed between network flights. 
Charter - The airline is responsible for providing full service, including fuel, aircraft, flight crews, maintenance, aircraft hull and liability insurance, landing fees, parking fees, catering, passenger handling fees, ground and cargo handling expenses and other operating expenses for an all-inclusive price. 
We provide contracted transportation capacity to our customers. We do not sell individually ticketed passenger service, nor do we sell to the public individually air-billed package delivery services. Our airlines operate wide-body and medium wide-body aircraft usually on intra-continental flights and medium and long range inter-continental flights. The airlines typically operate our freighter aircraft in the customers' regional networks that connect to and from global cargo networks. The aircraft types we operate have lower investment and ongoing maintenance costs and can operate cost efficiently with smaller loads on shorter routes than the larger capacity aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380.
Our airlines participate in the DoD CRAF Program which allows our airlines to bid for military charter operations for passenger and cargo transportation. Our airlines provide charter operations to the Air Mobility Command ("AMC") through contracts awarded by the U.S. Transportation Command ("USTC"), both of which are organized under the DoD. The USTC secures airlift capacity through fixed awards, which are awarded annually, and through bids for "expansion routes" which are awarded on a quarterly, monthly and as-needed basis. Under the contracts, we are responsible for all operating expenses including fuel, landing and ground handling expenses. We 
receive reimbursements from the USTC each month if the price of fuel paid by us for the flights exceeds a previously set peg price. If the price of fuel paid by us is less than the peg price, then we pay the difference to the USTC. Airlines may participate in the CRAF program either independently, or through teaming arrangements with other airlines. Our airlines are members of the Patriot Team of CRAF airlines. We pay a commission to the Patriot Team, based on certain revenues we receive under USTC contracts. 
ATI contracts with the USTC to operate its unique fleet of four Boeing 757 "combi" aircraft, which are capable of simultaneously carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck. ATI has been operating combi aircraft for the DoD since 1993. In January 2018, the USTC contracted with ATI to provide combi aircraft operations through December 2021 and awarded ATI three international routes for combi aircraft. OAI has been operating aircraft for the DoD since 1995. Contracts with the USTC are typically for a one-year period, however, the current passenger international charter contract has a two-year term with option periods, at the election of the USTC, through September 2024.
Approximately 12% of the Company's consolidated revenues for 2020 were derived from providing airline operations for customers other than DHL, ASI and the DoD. These ACMI and charter operations are typically provided to delivery companies, freight forwarders, vacation businesses and other airlines.
Demand for air cargo transportation services correlates closely with general economic conditions and the level of commercial activity in a geographic area. Stronger general economic conditions and growth in a region typically increases the need for air transportation. E-commerce growth is a strong indicator of growth in the express and network flying businesses which we enable with our assets and services. Historically, the cargo industry has experienced higher volumes during the fourth calendar quarter of each year due to increased shipments during the holiday season. Generally, time-critical delivery needs, such as just-in-time inventory management, increase the demand for air cargo delivery, while higher costs of aviation fuel generally reduces the demand for air delivery services. When aviation fuel prices increase, shippers will consider using ground transportation if the delivery time allows. 
We have limited exposure to fluctuations in the price of aviation fuel under contracts with our customers. DHL and Amazon, like most of our ACMI customers, procure the aircraft fuel and fueling services necessary for their flights. Our charter agreements with the U.S. Military are based on a preset pegged fuel price and include a subsequent true-up to the actual fuel prices.
Aircraft Maintenance and Modification Services
We provide aircraft maintenance and modification services to other air carriers through our ABX, AMES and Pemco subsidiaries. These subsidiaries have technical expertise related to aircraft modifications through a long history in aviation. They own many Supplemental Type Certificates (“STCs”). An STC is granted by the FAA and represents an ownership right, similar to an intellectual property right, which authorizes the alteration of an airframe, engine or component. We market our subsidiaries capabilities by identifying aviation-related maintenance and modification opportunities and matching them to customer needs.
AMES operates in Wilmington, Ohio, a repair station certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under Part 145 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, including hangars, a component shop and engineering capabilities. AMES is AS9100 quality certified for the aerospace industry. AMES’ marketable capabilities include the installation of avionics systems and flat panel displays for Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft. The Wilmington facility is capable of servicing airframes as large as the Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 777 aircraft. AMES , through its Pemco subsidiary, also operates an FAA certificated Part 145 repair station from a two-hangar facility in Tampa, Florida. The Tampa location has the capability to perform airframe maintenance on Boeing 767, 757, 737, McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Airbus A320, A321 and various regional jet model aircraft. We have the ability to perform line maintenance and airframe maintenance on McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Boeing 767, 757, 737, 777, 727 and Airbus A320 aircraft. We also have the capability to refurbish airframe components, including approximately 60% of the components utilized by Boeing 767 aircraft. Through Pemco, we also perform aircraft modification and engineering services, including passenger-to-freighter and passenger-to-combi conversions for Boeing 737-200, 737-300, 737-400 and 737-700 series aircraft. 
AMS is an Aviation Suppliers Association, ASA 100 Accredited reseller and broker of aircraft parts. AMS carries an inventory of Boeing 767, 757 and 737 spare parts and also maintains inventory on consignment from original equipment manufacturers, resellers, lessors and other airlines. AMS's customers include the commercial air cargo industry, passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers and contract maintenance companies serving the commercial aviation industry, as well as other resellers.
Ground Services
Through the Company's LGSTX subsidiaries, we provide labor and management for load transfer and sorting services at certain facilities inside or near airports in the U.S. LGSTX also provides maintenance services for material handling and sorting equipment as well as ground support equipment throughout the U.S. LGSTX has a large inventory of ground support equipment, such as power units, airstarts, deicers and pushback vehicles that it rents to airports, ground handlers, airlines and other customers. LGSTX is also licensed to resell aircraft fuel. 
We currently provide mail sorting services to the United States Postal Service ("USPS") at two locations in the U.S. Under each of these contracts, we are compensated at a firm price for fixed costs and an additional amount based on the volume of mail handled at each sort center. We also provide international mail forwarding services through the John F. Kennedy International Airport and the O'Hare International Airport. We formerly provided mail sorting services at five other USPS locations between September 2004 and September 2018, but the contracts for these locations were not renewed with us after they expired during September 2018. LGSTX also arranged similar load transfer services to support ASI at certain locations, but the contracts for these services were terminated as of August 2019.
Flight Support 
ATS is certificated under Part 142 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to offer flight crew training to customers. ATS also offers Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 flight simulators which can be rented by customers for use in conjunction with their flight training programs. The simulators allow airlines to qualify flight crewmembers under FAA requirements without performing check flights in an aircraft. 
Competitive Conditions
Competition for aircraft lease placements is generally affected by aircraft type, aircraft availability and lease rates. The aircraft in our fleet provide cost-effective air transportation for medium range requirements. We target our leases to cargo airlines and delivery companies seeking medium widebody airlift. We believe our fleet gives us the ability to offer our customers a superior value proposition. Competitors in the aircraft leasing markets include GE Capital Aviation Services and Altavair Aviation Leasing, among others. The Airbus A300-600 and A330 aircraft can provide capabilities similar to the Boeing 767 for medium wide-body airlift. 
Our airline subsidiaries compete with other airlines to place aircraft under ACMI arrangements and charter contracts. Other cargo airlines include Amerijet International, Inc., Atlas Air, Inc., Kalitta Air LLC, Northern Air Cargo, LLC, National Air Cargo Group, Inc., Southern Air, Inc. and Western Global Airlines, LLC. Of these, Atlas Air, Inc. also operates passenger aircraft. The primary competitive factors in the air transportation industry are operating costs, fuel efficiency, geographic coverage, aircraft range, aircraft reliability and capacity. The cost of airline operations is significantly impacted by the cost of flight crewmembers, which can vary among airlines depending on their collective bargaining agreements. Cargo airlines also compete for cargo volumes with passenger airlines that have substantial belly cargo capacity. The air transportation industry is capital intensive and highly competitive, especially during periods of excess aircraft capacity competing for commercial cargo and passenger volumes and DoD requirements. 
The scheduled delivery industry is dominated by integrated, door-to-door delivery companies including DHL, the USPS, FedEx Corporation, United Parcel Service, Inc. and ASI. Although the volume of our business is impacted by competition among these integrated carriers, we do not usually compete directly with them. 
The aircraft maintenance industry is labor intensive and typically competes based on cost, capabilities and reputation for quality. U.S. airlines may contract for aircraft maintenance with maintenance and repair organizations ("MROs") in other countries or geographies with a lower labor wage base, making the industry highly cost competitive. Other aircraft MROs include AAR Corp and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. 
Airline Operations
Flight Operations and Control
The Company's airline operations are conducted pursuant to authority granted to each of the three airlines by the FAA and the DOT. Airline flight operations, including aircraft dispatching, flight tracking, crew training and crew scheduling are planned and controlled by personnel within each airline. The Company staffs aircraft dispatching and flight tracking 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The FAA prescribes the minimum requirements, methods and means by which air carrier flight operations are conducted, including but not limited to the qualifications and training of flight crew members, the release of aircraft for flight, the tracking of flights, the length of time crew members can be on duty, aircraft operating procedures, proper navigation of aircraft, compliance with air traffic control instructions and other operational functions.
Aircraft Maintenance
Our airlines’ operations are regulated by the FAA for aircraft safety and maintenance. Each airline performs routine inspections and airframe maintenance in accordance with applicable FAA-approved aircraft maintenance programs. In addition, the airlines build into their maintenance programs FAA-mandated Airworthiness Directive and manufacturer Service Bulletin compliance on all of their aircraft. The airlines’ maintenance and engineering personnel coordinate routine and non-routine maintenance requirements. Each airline’s maintenance program includes tracking the maintenance status of each aircraft, consulting with manufacturers and suppliers about procedures to correct irregularities, and training maintenance personnel on the requirements of its FAA-approved maintenance program. The airlines contract with MROs, including AMES and Pemco, to perform heavy maintenance on airframes and engines. Each airline owns and maintains an inventory of spare aircraft engines, engine parts, auxiliary power units, aircraft parts and consumable items. The quantity of spare items maintained is based on the fleet size, engine type operated and the reliability history of the item types.
Security
The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) requires ABX and ATI to comply with security protocols as set out in each carrier’s standard all-cargo aircraft operator security plan which provide for extensive security practices and procedures that must be followed. The security plan provides for the conducting of background checks on persons with access to cargo and/or aircraft, the securing of the aircraft while on the ground, the acceptance and screening of cargo to be moved by air, the handling of suspicious cargo and the securing of cargo ground facilities, among other requirements. Comprehensive internal audit and evaluation programs are actively mandated and maintained. In the case of OAI, a passenger carrier, and for ATI's passenger/freighter "combi" operations, additional requirements apply under the carriers' respective security programs, including passenger and baggage screening, airport terminal security, assessment and distribution of intelligence including the TSA "no-fly" list, and threat response.
Customers are required to inform the airlines in writing of the nature and composition of any freight which is classified as "Hazardous Materials" or “Dangerous Goods” by the DOT and passengers are generally prohibited from carrying "Hazardous Materials" or “Dangerous Goods” in their baggage. Notwithstanding these procedures, our airline subsidiaries could unknowingly transport contraband or undeclared hazardous materials for customers, or could unknowingly transport an unauthorized passenger or a passenger in possession of an unauthorized item, which could result in fines and penalties and possible damage to the aircraft.
Insurance
Our airline subsidiaries are required by the DOT to carry a minimum amount of aircraft liability insurance. Their aircraft leases, loan agreements and ACMI agreements also require them to carry such insurance. The Company currently maintains public liability and property damage insurance, and our airline subsidiaries currently maintain aircraft hull and liability insurance and war risk insurance for their respective aircraft fleets in amounts consistent with industry standards. CAM’s customers are also required to maintain similar insurance coverage.
Human Capital
Description
As of December 31, 2020, our workforce was composed of 5,305 full-time and part-time employees. We employed approximately 1,015 flight crewmembers, 400 flight attendants, 215 flight support personnel, 1,940 aircraft maintenance managers and technicians, 1,210 employees for ground equipment and logistics services, 45 employees for sales and marketing and 480 employees for administrative functions. In addition to full time and part time employees, we often employ contractors and temporary employees to assist in aircraft line maintenance and package sortation during peak operational times. On December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 4,380 full-time and part-time employees. Over 99% of our workforce is based in the United States.
The Company’s flight crewmembers and flight attendants are unionized employees. The table below summarizes the representation of the Company’s flight crewmembers at December 31, 2020.

Under the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”), as amended, crewmember labor agreements do not expire, so the existing contract remains in effect throughout any negotiation process. If required, mediation under the RLA is conducted by the National Mediation Board, which has the sole discretion as to how long mediation can last and when it will end. In addition to direct negotiations and mediation, the RLA includes a provision for potential arbitration of unresolved issues and a 30-day “cooling-off” period before either party can resort to self-help, including, but not limited to, a work stoppage.
Objectives
Our employees are critical to the on-going success of the Company. Our approach to managing human capital includes the following: maintaining the health and safety of our employees; attracting and retaining skilled individuals; continuously improving the skills of our workforce; promoting inclusive and engaging work environments; and compensating and treating all employees fairly. 
To attract and retain skilled employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits, including medical care, paid time off, retirement savings, mental health counseling and other employee benefits. Further, we are committed to training and supporting our employees' continuous development of professional, technical and management skills. We develop technical training programs which facilitate the licensure and certification of flight crews, aviation mechanics and other skilled jobs. We partner with third parties to assist employees in developing leadership skills and valuing diversity in our workforce. In 2020, our voluntary employee resignation rate was approximately 11%. 
We have taken precautions to prevent, detect and limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the workplace. These practices include daily temperature checks, requiring face masks, periodically sanitizing facilities, frequent cleaning of high touch surfaces, supporting remote working, implementing travel restrictions, promoting social distancing and frequent hand washing, contact tracing, quarantining, and other practices prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have not experienced a wide-spread outbreak at any location. The virus positivity rate is approximately 11% of our workforce. 
Pursuant to payroll support programs under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “PSP Extension Law”) the Company has received funds to protect employees’ jobs by offsetting payroll expenses. In light of these payroll support programs, we have not implemented and do not anticipate implementing pay cuts or furloughs through March 2021.
Flight crewmembers are required to be licensed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (“FARs”), with specific ratings for the aircraft type to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to operate aircraft. Licenses and medical certifications are subject to recurrent requirements as set forth in the FARs, to include recurrent training and minimum amounts of recent flying experience.
The FAA requires initial and recurrent training for most flight and maintenance personnel. Quality control inspectors must also be licensed and qualified to perform maintenance inspections on Company operated and maintained aircraft. The majority of our aircraft mechanics have one or more FAA licenses. Our subsidiaries pay for all of the required recurrent training and provide training for their ground service personnel as well. Their training programs have received all required FAA approvals. Similarly, our flight dispatchers and flight followers receive FAA approved training on the airlines' requirements and specific aircraft.
Intellectual Property
The Company owns many Supplemental Type Certificates ("STCs") and similar approvals issued by the FAA. The Company uses these STCs mainly in support of its own fleets; however, AMES and Pemco have marketed certain STCs to other airlines.
Information Systems
We are dependent on technology to conduct our daily operations including for data processing, communications and regulatory compliance. We rely on critical computerized systems for aircraft maintenance records, flight planning, crew scheduling, employee training, financial records, cyber-security and other processes. We utilize information systems to maintain records about the maintenance status and history of each major aircraft component, as required by FAA regulations. Using our information systems, we track aircraft maintenance schedules and also control inventories and maintenance tasks, including the work directives of personnel performing those tasks. We rely on information systems to track crewmember flight and duty times, and crewmember training status. The Company’s flight operations systems coordinate flight schedules and crew schedules. 
We invest significant time and financial resources to acquire, develop and maintain information systems to facilitate our operations. Our information technology infrastructure includes security measures, backup procedures and redundancy capabilities. We rely increasingly on software applications, hosted technologies, data transmissions and cybersecurity safe-guards provided by or in conjunction with third parties. To remain competitive, we must continue to deploy new technologies while controlling costs and maintaining regulatory compliance and security safeguards. 
Regulation
Our subsidiaries’ airline operations are primarily regulated by the DOT, the FAA, and the TSA. Those operations must comply with numerous economic, safety, security and environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. In addition, they must comply with various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations.
Environment
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization ("ICAO"). In 2016, the EPA issued a finding on greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from aircraft and its relationship to air pollution. This finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. In January 2021, the EPA issued a final rule regarding GHG emissions standards for new aircraft engines consistent with ICAO standards that were adopted in 2017. The EPA final rule does not apply to engines on aircraft that are already in service, as is also the case with the ICAO standards. However, the administration of President Biden has stated that it plans to review the EPA emissions standards issued by the prior Administration and, further, the EPA standards have been challenged by several states and environmental organizations. We cannot predict the results of the Biden administration's review or the outcome of legal challenges to the EPA's final rules. Our subsidiaries’ aircraft meet all currently applicable requirements for engine emission levels. 
Under the Clean Air Act, individual states or the EPA may also adopt regulations requiring reductions in emissions for one or more localities based on the measured air quality at such localities. These regulations may seek 
to limit or restrict emissions by restricting the use of emission-producing ground service equipment or aircraft auxiliary power units. Further, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.
In addition, the European Commission has approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") for GHG emissions to the airline industry. Currently, under the European Union’s ETS, all ABX, ATI and OAI flights that are wholly within the European Union are covered by the ETS requirements, and each year our airlines are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. If the airline's flight activity during the year produces carbon emissions exceeding the number of carbon emissions allowances that it had been awarded, the airline must acquire allowances from other airlines in the open market. Our airlines operate intra-EU flights from time to time and management believes that such flights are operated in compliance with ETS requirements.
Similarly, in 2016, the ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. A pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate, followed by a first phase of the program beginning in 2024 that is also voluntary, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. The United States has agreed to participate in the two voluntary phases. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
The U.S. has also recently re-entered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 196 countries to reduce GHG emissions, and the effect of the re-entry by the U.S. on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. 
The federal government generally regulates aircraft engine noise at its source. However, local airport operators may, under certain circumstances, regulate airport operations based on aircraft noise considerations. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 provides that, in the case of Stage 3 aircraft (all of our operating aircraft satisfy Stage 3 noise compliance requirements), an airport operator must obtain the carriers’ consent to, or the government’s approval of, the rule prior to its adoption. We believe the operation of our airline subsidiaries’ aircraft either complies with or is exempt from compliance with currently applicable local airport rules. However, some airport authorities have adopted local noise regulations, and, to the extent more stringent aircraft operating regulations are adopted on a widespread basis, our airline subsidiaries may be required to spend substantial funds, make schedule changes or take other actions to comply with such local rules.
Department of Transportation
The DOT maintains authority over certain aspects of domestic and international air transportation serving the United States, such as consumer protection, accommodation of passengers with disabilities, requiring a minimum level of insurance and the requirement that a company be “fit” to hold a certificate to engage in air transportation. In addition, the DOT continues to regulate many aspects of international aviation, including the award of certain international routes. The DOT has issued to ABX a Domestic All-Cargo Air Service Certificate for air cargo transportation between all points within the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The DOT has issued to ATI certificate authority to engage in scheduled interstate air transportation, which is currently limited to all-cargo operations. ATI's DOT certificate authority also authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.  Additionally, the DOT has issued to ABX and ATI Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing each of them to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of cargo and mail between the U.S. and all current and future U.S. open-skies partner countries, which currently consists of approximately 130 foreign countries.  ABX and ATI also hold exemption authorities issued by the DOT to conduct scheduled all-cargo operations between the U.S. and certain foreign countries with which the U.S. does not have a liberal ("open-skies") air transportation agreement. The DOT has issued to OAI a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Interstate Charter Air Transportation and a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Foreign Charter Air Transportation that authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail. In 2019, the DOT also issued OAI exemption authority to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of property and mail between the U.S. and all existing and future countries with an open-skies air service agreement with the U.S.
By maintaining these certificates, the Company, through ABX and ATI, can and currently does conduct all-cargo charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Further, the certificates issued to ATI and OAI authorize the air carriers to conduct passenger charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Periodically, the DOT re-examines a company’s managerial competence, financial resources and plans, compliance disposition and citizenship in order to determine whether the carrier remains fit, willing and able to engage in the transportation services it is authorized to provide. 
The DOT has the authority to impose civil penalties, or to modify, suspend or revoke our certificates and exemption authorities for cause, including failure to comply with federal laws or DOT regulations. A corporation or a limited liability company structured like a corporation holding the above-referenced certificates and exemption authorities must continuously qualify as a citizen of the United States, which, pursuant to federal law, requires that (1) it be organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state, territory or possession thereof, (2) that its president and at least two-thirds of its Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, (3) that no more than 25% of its voting interest be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, and (4) that it not otherwise be subject to foreign control. We believe our airline subsidiaries possess all necessary DOT-issued certificates and authorities to conduct their current operations and that each continues to qualify as a citizen of the United States.
Federal Aviation Administration
The FAA regulates aircraft safety and flight operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, flight dispatch, training, communications, the carriage of hazardous materials and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA issues operating certificates and detailed "operations specifications" to carriers that possess the technical competence to safely conduct air carrier operations. In addition, the FAA issues certificates of airworthiness to each aircraft that meets the requirements for aircraft design and maintenance. ABX, ATI and OAI believe they hold all airworthiness and other FAA certificates and authorities required for the conduct of their business and the operation of their aircraft. The FAA has the power to suspend, modify or revoke such certificates for cause and to impose civil penalties for any failure to comply with federal laws or FAA regulations.
The FAA has the authority to issue regulations, airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, the inspection, maintenance and modification of aircraft and the replacement of aircraft structures, components and parts, based on industry safety findings, the age of the aircraft and other factors. For example, the FAA has required ABX to perform inspections of its Boeing 767 aircraft to determine if certain of the aircraft structures and components meet all aircraft certification requirements. If the FAA were to determine that the aircraft structures or components are not adequate, it could order our airline subsidiaries and other operators to take certain actions, including but not limited to, grounding aircraft, reducing cargo loads, strengthening any structure or component found to be inadequate, or making other modifications to the aircraft. New mandatory directives could also be issued requiring the Company’s airline subsidiaries to inspect and replace aircraft components based on their age or condition. As a routine matter, the FAA issues airworthiness directives applicable to the aircraft operated by our airline subsidiaries, and our airlines comply, sometimes at considerable cost, as part of their aircraft maintenance program.
In addition to the FAA practice of issuing regulations and airworthiness directives as conditions warrant, the FAA has adopted new regulations to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft on a more systematic basis. FAA regulations mandate that aircraft manufacturers establish aircraft limits of validity and service action requirements based on the number of aircraft flight cycles (a cycle being one takeoff and one landing) and flight hours before widespread fatigue damage might occur. Service action requirements include inspections and modifications to preclude development of significant fatigue damage in specific aircraft structural areas. The Boeing Company has provided its recommendations of the limits of validity to the FAA, and the FAA has now approved the limits for the Boeing 757, 767 and 777 model aircraft. Consequently, after the limit of validity is reached for a particular model aircraft, air carriers will be unable to continue to operate the aircraft without the FAA first granting an extension of time to the operator. There can be no assurance that the FAA would extend the deadline, if an extension were to be requested. At this point, we do not foresee a situation in which we would seek an extension from the FAA for an aircraft.
The FAA requires each of our airline subsidiaries to implement a drug and alcohol testing program with respect to all employees performing safety sensitive functions and, unless already subject to testing, contractor employees that engage in safety sensitive functions. Each of the Company's airlines complies with these regulations.
Transportation Security Administration
The TSA, an administration within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for the screening of passengers and their baggage. TSA rules also require airlines to adopt and comply with standard aircraft operator security programs, including the manner in which cargo must be screened prior to being loaded on aircraft. Our airline subsidiaries comply with all applicable aircraft, passenger and cargo security requirements. The TSA has adopted cargo security-related rules that have imposed additional burdens on our airlines and our customers. The TSA also requires each airline to perform criminal history background checks on all employees. In addition, we may be required to reimburse the TSA for the cost of security services it may provide to the Company’s airline subsidiaries in the future. The TSA holds (and has exercised) authority to issue regulations, including in cases of emergency the authority to do so without advance notice, including issuance of a grounding order as occurred on September 11, 2001. TSA's enforcement powers are similar to the DOT's and FAA's described above.
International Regulations
When operating in other countries, our airlines are subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or, in the absence of such an agreement, the airlines' operating rights are governed by principles of reciprocity. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of the agreements affecting our international operations. Commercial arrangements such as ACMI agreements between our airlines and our customers in other countries, may require the approval of foreign governmental authorities. Foreign authorities may limit or restrict the use of our aircraft in certain countries. Also, foreign government authorities often require licensing and business registration before beginning operations. Foreign laws, rules, regulations and licensing requirements governing air transportation are generally similar, in principle, to the regulatory scheme of the United States as described above, although in some cases foreign requirements are comparatively less onerous and in others, more onerous. Such authorities have enforcement powers generally similar to those of the U.S. agencies described above.
Data Protection 
There has recently been increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and in other countries. For example, the European Union ("E.U.") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and increases the requirements related to the protection of personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, violations of the GDPR can result in significant fines. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, and are considering data localization laws that would govern the use of data outside of their respective jurisdictions. 
Other Regulations
Various regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over significant aspects of our business, and it is possible that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to the above, other laws and regulations to which we are subject, and the agencies responsible for compliance with such laws and regulations, include the following:

•The labor relations of our airline subsidiaries are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board certain regulatory powers with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions arising under collective bargaining agreements;
•The Federal Communications Commission regulates our airline subsidiaries’ use of radio facilities pursuant to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended;
•U.S. Customs and Border Protection issues landing rights, inspects passengers entering the United States, and inspects cargo imported to the U.S. from our subsidiaries’ international operations, and those operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions;
•The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has authority to impose requirements related to the mitigation of communicable diseases such as requiring masking on aircraft, negative test results, collection of passenger data for contact tracing, quarantine requirements, etc.
•The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services regulations regarding the eligibility of our employees to work in the U.S., and the entry of passengers to the U.S.;
•The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with wage, work conditions and other regulations of the Department of Labor regarding our employees; and
•The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other government agencies administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy, which may limit our business activities in and for certain areas.
