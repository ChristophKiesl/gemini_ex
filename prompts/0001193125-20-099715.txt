 Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to School Specialty, SSI, the Company, we or our refer to School Specialty, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday in December. The January 1, 2017 to December 30, 2017, the December 31, 2017 to December 29, 2018, and the December 30, 2018 to December 28, 2019 years will be referred to as fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, respectively, in this Annual Report. 
 Company Overview 
 The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has significantly affected our business beginning with the latter part of March 2020. The ultimate impact of coronavirus is highly uncertain and subject to change. Our business is predominantly focused on serving public and private school districts. However, most states have taken the rare step of closing schools to try to slow the spread of the virus. As of March 23, 2020, forty-seven states have mandated state-wide school closures, and many districts in the remaining three states have independently decided to shutdown. School shutdowns have resulted in our customers inability to accept shipments of our products and substantially lower orders. While the Company does not yet know the full effect or length of school closures or the impact to the global economy as a whole, the effects could have a material impact on the Companys business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as those of the third parties on which we rely. 
 School Specialty is a leading distributor of innovative and proprietary products, programs and services to the education marketplace. The Company designs, develops, and sources products to provide educators with a comprehensive offering of school supplies, furniture and both curriculum and supplemental learning resources. Working in collaboration with educators, School Specialty reaches beyond the scope of textbooks to help teachers, guidance counselors and school administrators ensure that every student reaches his or her full potential. School Specialtys product offering includes supplies, furniture, technology products, supplemental learning products (instruction and intervention) and curriculum solutions, which are primarily sold to the education marketplace. The Company provides educators with its own innovative and proprietary products and services, from basic school supplies to products and services that address student safety and well-being to Science, Reading, Language and Math teaching materials, as well as test preparation materials. Through its nationwide distribution network, School Specialty also provides its customers with access to a broad spectrum of well-recognized, third-party brands across its product categories. This assortment strategy enables the Company to offer a broad range of products primarily serving the pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade (PreK-12) education market at the state, district and school levels. The Company has expanded the distribution of its products beyond the education market by establishing relationships with e-tailers and retailers. School Specialty offers its products through two operating segments: Distribution and Curriculum. 
 As of December 28, 2019, the Company had $2.1 million in cash and excess availability of $19.9 million on its ABL facility. However, the Companys operating results were below plan for fiscal 2019 which resulted in non-compliance with certain financial covenants of the Companys debt facilities in the third quarter of 2019 and all of the Companys debt has been classified as current in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 9  Debt for details regarding the Companys debt facilities. To address the non-compliance, the Company entered into short-term forbearance agreements and amendments with its senior secured lenders for a forbearance related to the third quarter non-compliance and amendments to the terms of its debt facilities. The forbearance and amendment, among other things, resulted in restrictions on the Companys borrowing capacity and an acceleration of the current maturity dates. However, the forbearance and amendments also allowed the Company to pursue an extension of the maturity date with the holders of the currently maturing deferred cash payment obligations, and the Company was able to successfully negotiate one-year extensions on $21.3 million, or 76 percent, of the total outstanding obligations of $27.9 million, which were scheduled to mature on December 12, 2019. Those deferred vendor payment obligations which have not been extended, approximately $6.6 million, are past due as of the end of fiscal 2019. Uncertainty as to the success of entering into amendments with the Companys senior secured lenders, extensions to the currently-maturing deferred cash payment obligations and the Companys ability to remain in compliance with future period covenants could result in the Companys senior secured lenders exercising their rights and remedies with respect to our current non-compliance, resulting in substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern twelve months from the date the financial statements are issued. 
 Management believes that the Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on a combination of its ability to return to normal business operations, negotiating satisfactory terms related to obtaining the additional funding necessary to repay its currently maturing debt obligations, renegotiating certain terms of its existing debt facilities, and pursuing other strategic alternatives. Management hired an investment banker in August 2019 to assist in both seeking additional capital financing and, as announced in October 2019, to pursue strategic alternatives.

  Indications received from the process, thus far, have not ascribed meaningful, if any, value to the equity. It is likely that our current financial situation will depend on the negotiations with senior secured lenders, and we expect those negotiations will result in our existing equity having little or no value, and the senior secured lenders taking control of the Company. The Board and management believe that, if the senior secured lenders acquire substantially all of the equity of the Company, it will result in in a restructuring of our debt obligations and other measures intended to improve the liquidity position of the Company. To the extent the senior secured lenders take control of the Company, it is our expectation that such measures would be taken in an effort to enable the Company to operate as a going concern. However, there can be no assurance that additional debt or other financing from the Companys current senior secured lenders will be sufficient amounts and on acceptable terms, necessary to provide adequate liquidity. 
 We believe our Distribution group offers educators the broadest range and deepest assortment of basic school supplies, instruction and intervention solutions, furniture and equipment, technology products, physical education products, safety and security, and other classroom and school equipment available from a single supplier. The Distribution group also offers a number of innovative and highly targeted teaching solutions for educators designed to help students who are performing below grade level or who could benefit from supplemental instruction in a specific area of learning. This group continues to expand its portfolio of instructional programs, combining print-based and digital instructional and assessment tools to deliver value to educators and build competitive advantages in the marketplace. This breadth of offering and unique positioning creates competitive advantages in our ability to aggregate an assortment of products to meet customer requirements across multiple categories. This group further differentiates itself through its distribution network and nationwide sales force, able to reach substantially all schools nationwide, as well as the Canadian marketplace. Another core differentiator is our commitment to innovation, which is achieved by working with teachers, administrators and other subject matter experts to develop proprietary products that result in innovative approaches to student development and learning. 
 Our Curriculum group develops proprietary science curriculum programs to help educators deepen students subject matter understanding and accelerate the learning process. This group offers curriculum and supplemental learning solutions for science and works with teachers and educators to drive new offerings based on standards, such as Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards, as well as its own and third-party customized products for various grade levels (primarily PreK-12).
Across both groups, during 2019 we reached our customers through a sales force of approximately 230 professionals (approximately 105 of which were inside sales representatives), 5.9 million catalogs, and our proprietary e-commerce websites. In fiscal 2019, we believe we sold products to approximately 68% of the approximately 133,000 schools in the United States, and we believe we reached a majority of the 3.1 million teachers in those schools. For fiscal 2019, we generated revenues of $626.1 million. 
 The following is a more complete description of our two operating groups, or segments. 
 Distribution Segment. Our Distribution segment provides a wide assortment of products, solutions and services primarily to the PreK-12 education market, e-tail and retail channel partners. Products include a comprehensive line of everyday consumables, specialized supplies, indoor and outdoor furniture and equipment, technology products, safety and security products, instructional teaching materials, and intervention products, including assessment tools, and state-specific test preparation materials, among others. Distribution products are sold via a nationwide sales force and distribution network, with reach to the majority of schools throughout the United States. Distribution products are also sold direct to teachers and to consumers through the Companys various e-commerce platforms. Distribution products are grouped into four product categories which include: 
 

 | Supplies
--+---------


 | Furniture
--+----------


 | Instruction and Intervention
--+-----------------------------


 | A/V Technology
--+---------------

 A fifth product category, Agendas, was exited by the Company at the end of fiscal 2019. Agendas was a category with declining revenues over the past ten years, with little chance for recovery in our estimation. Through 2018, the Agendas category was accretive to operating income and cash flow, while the categorys results for 2019 were dilutive. 
 By working closely with school administrators, teachers and other educators, the Distribution segment employs a curation strategy, offering a solutions-based approach across multiple product categories. The Company helps schools with their purchasing decisions by offering a suite of value-added products and services to fit within budget parameters, while also helping to manage supply chain issues, and back-to-school logistics to help school administrators save both time and money. This segment also offers project management and design services through its Project by Design® team (PbD), for both school refurbishment and new construction projects. As an end-to-end solution provider for schools, PbD is able to help schools outfit both indoor and outdoor school facilities with state- of-the-art furniture and equipment, while also serving as a single source for additional proprietary and/or third-party branded products.

 Distribution products include both proprietary branded products and other national brands. Among the segments well-known proprietary brands are Childcraft®, Sax® Arts & Crafts, Califone®, Classroom Select®, Sportime®, Abilitations®, Hammond & StephensTM, Brodhead Garrett®, School Smart®, Royal Seating®, Projects by Design®, CPO ScienceTM, Frey Scientific®, Educators Publishing Service®, Wordly Wise 3000®, Explode the Code®, ThinkMath!TM, SSI Guardian ®, Making Connections®, S.P.I.R.E®, Buckle Down®, and Coach®. Distribution products accounted for approximately 95% of our revenues for fiscal 2019. 
 Curriculum Segment. Our Curriculum segment is a publisher of proprietary core curriculum in the Science area of the PreK-12 education market: 
 Products in our Curriculum segment are typically sold to curriculum specialists and other educators with direct responsibility for advancing student outcomes. 
 The Curriculum segment develops standards-based curriculum science products. Its offerings are tailored to address specific learning needs, drive improved student performance, engage learners and accelerate the learning process. A team of approximately 13 product development associates leverages long-standing relationships with outside developers, authors, co-publishing strategic partners and consultants to develop educational products and solutions that meet curriculum standards and improve classroom teaching effectiveness. 
 Our product portfolio is guided by PreK-12 curriculum standards, which can vary by state. However, there is a consistency throughout the portfolio that allows for the creation of nationally marketed programs that can be customized to meet state-specific curriculum standards where needed. We believe our Curriculum segment provides a broad collection of educational programs that effectively combines supplemental curriculum solutions, academic planning and organization, inquiry based (hands-on) learning, comprehensive learning kits, extensive performance assessments, and consultant-led or web-delivered teacher training. New reading solutions, for example, combine research proven materials, technology, and teaching methods to create dynamic, systematic, and individualized instruction. Additionally, when applicable these solutions are designed to address Common Core State Standards at various grade levels as well as Next Generation Science Standards. 
 Our Curriculum segment product lines include Delta Education® and FOSS®. Our Curriculum products accounted for approximately 5% of our revenues in fiscal 2019. 
 School Specialty, Inc., founded in October 1959, was acquired by U.S. Office Products in May 1996. In June 1998, School Specialty was spun-off from U.S. Office Products in a tax-free transaction. In August 2000, we reincorporated from Delaware to Wisconsin. In accordance with the 2013 Reorganization Plan (as disclosed in prior years), in June 2013, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. Our principal offices are located at W6316 Design Drive, Greenville, Wisconsin 54942, and our telephone number is (920) 734-5712. Our general website address is www.schoolspecialty.com. You may obtain, free of charge, copies of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K (and amendments to those reports) filed with, or furnished to, the Securities Exchange Commission as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed or furnished such reports by accessing our website at http://www.schoolspecialty.com, selecting Investors and then selecting the SEC Filings link. Information contained in any of our websites is not deemed to be a part of this Annual Report. 
 Product Lines 
 We market our proprietary brands and third-party product assortments across a wide variety of industry categories including general school supplies, arts and crafts, physical education, school safety and security, instructional solutions and special needs, classroom furniture and equipment, outdoor furniture and equipment, technology solutions, and both standards-based and supplemental curriculum solutions. These products are marketed and sold through our two primary business segments: Distribution and Curriculum. 
 Our Distribution offerings are focused in the following areas: 
 Supplies Category: We believe we are the largest marketer of school and classroom supplies into the education market. Through our School Specialty Distribution catalogs, which offer both national brands and many of our proprietary School Smart® products, we provide an extensive offering of basic supplies that are consumed in schools and classrooms as well as in home use. This offering includes office products, classroom supplies, janitorial and sanitation supplies, school equipment, school and student safety and security products and services, physical education products, art supplies and paper, among others. Certain of these products are more commodity-like in 
 
4 


  nature and require an efficient supply chain and distribution and logistics expertise to be competitive. As a result of our large distribution network and supply chain expertise, our customers view us as a preferred supplier in the Supplies category. Our School Smart private label products are primarily sourced directly from low-cost, overseas manufacturers, which we believe will allow us to enhance our product offering and improve profitability. 
 Our leading market position in the art supplies area of this category is led by Sax® Arts & Crafts, which offers products and programs focused on nurturing creativity and self-expression through hands-on learning. The product line ranges from original cross-curricular lesson plans and teaching resource materials to basic art materials, such as paints, brushes and papers. 
 We also offer a full range of physical education programs, solutions, resources and equipment designed to help improve student and staff wellness. Our products, which are primarily offered under our Sportime® brand, range from traditional sports equipment to unique and innovative products designed to encourage participation by all. 
 We offer several proprietary and innovative instructional solutions and teaching materials to schools and school districts, all designed to help teachers teach and students remain on par with grade-level learning requirements. We also offer a full range of solutions for children with special learning needs through our Abilitations® and Integrations® product lines as well as several third-party brands. Our proprietary solutions and products are designed to help educate children with learning, behavioral, sensory or physical differences and are focused on helping educators and therapists make a real difference in a childs life. 
 Our early childhood offering provides educators of young children with products that promote learning and development. Our full-line, highly proprietary offering provides educators with everything from advanced literacy and dramatic play to manipulatives, and basic arts and crafts. We have several proprietary brands targeting the early childhood market and our flagship brand, Childcraft® is a well-known and trusted brand in the education market. 
 At Frey Scientific®, we offer a wide selection of science education products, supplemental curriculum, lab equipment and supplies, all of which are a part of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) solutions that advance effective learning. By working with a network of classroom teachers at various grade levels, we continually seek to understand and adapt to customers needs and Next Generation Science Standards. Our dedicated science education specialists, many with advanced degrees and teaching experience, provide powerful insights that continue to enhance our product line. Frey Scientific elementary, middle and high school education products include supplemental curriculum, Inquiry Investigations® hands-on kits with virtual labs, innovative equipment and precision instrumentation, essential science classroom supplies and laboratory design services and furniture. 
 Instructional & Intervention: We believe we are one of the largest marketers of educator supplies and related educational materials and technology solutions, as well as instructional learning materials. Our Instructional Solutions category includes supplemental learning materials (reading, math and science), teaching resources, classroom libraries and manipulatives. We offer several proprietary and innovative instructional solutions and teaching materials to schools and school districts, all designed to help teachers and students remain on par with grade-level learning requirements. Innovation, proprietary products, brand strength and direct marketing are key success factors. These product offerings create opportunity for margin enhancement through innovation and unique assortments. 
 Our reading and math intervention and supplemental learning programs, which are standards- and curriculum-based products, are focused on providing educators and parents with effective tools to encourage and enhance literacy and mathematics skills, serving the K-12 grade levels. Educators Publishing Service® (EPS®) provides tailored reading and language arts instruction for students with special needs and proprietary instructional materials for educators. For over 60 years, EPS Literacy and Intervention has been the leader in developing and publishing programs to help struggling students, including those with dyslexia and other reading difficulties, as well as providing materials that support on-level students so they can continue to meet their educational goals. Today, EPS provides K-12 blended, customized intervention solutions to help at-risk and on-level students build proficiency in reading and math. A variety of programs connect time-tested content and innovation to give educators the power of differentiation to reach all of their students and meet the changing demands of todays classrooms. From screening through to intervention, progress monitoring, reporting and professional development, EPS offers an integrated approach to address the Common Core State Standards and Response to Intervention (RTI). 
 Our products offer reading, math and response to intervention solutions to help K-12 schools close the achievement gap for students who fall below proficiency benchmarks. Our print and technology resources combine to meet the instructional needs of students possessing learning disabilities or who are at risk for reading and math failure. Some of our other innovative teaching materials include Explode the Code®, Making Connections® and Making Connections InterventionTM, Path Driver for Math® and Path Driver for Reading®, Sitton Spelling and Word Skills®, S.P.I.R.E®, and Wordly Wise®, among others.

 With our acquisition in fiscal 2017 of the assets of Triumph Learning LLC, our offering includes state-specific assessment preparation materials. Triumph Learnings flagship brand, Coach®, has been utilized throughout education, providing educational facilities and teachers with hands-on test preparation books for ELA, math, science and social studies, with materials customized to state-specific best practices, along with a comprehensive series of supplemental and intervention resources for ELA, math and science. Solutions are delivered through multiple platforms, including both print and digital, as well as through third-party platforms and applications. 
 Furniture Category: We believe we are one of the most comprehensive providers of school furniture in the United States, offering a full range of school-specific furniture and equipment, for both in-school, in-classroom and outdoor use. Our offering allows us to equip an entire facility, refurbish a specific location within a school, such as a cafeteria, gymnasium or media center, or to replace individual items such as student desks and chairs. We manufacture award-winning early childhood wood furniture in our Bird-in-Hand® Woodworks facility. We launched a product line of proprietary furniture under our Classroom Select® brand and also provide innovative furniture offerings through our Royal Seating®, Childcraft®, and Korners for Kids® product lines. We are authorized national or regional distributors for leading third-party lines. In addition, we offer our proprietary service, Projects by Design®, which provides turn-key needs assessment and conforming design, budget analysis and project management for new construction projects. 
 A/V Technology: We believe we are among the leading providers of educator-inspired quality audio technology products, including multi-media, audio visual and presentation equipment for the PreK-12 education market. These products are primarily marketed under the brand name Califone®. We also offer a host of other technology solutions under Califone and other third-party brands and are focused on expanding our assortment of products to take advantage of increased investments by schools and school districts in new and emerging technology platforms. 
 Our Curriculum offering is focused in the following area: 
 Science: Our science product category, largely comprised of highly recognized proprietary or exclusive offerings, provides learning resources focused on promoting scientific education and inquiry, literacy and achievement to the PreK-12 education market. Our products range from laboratory supplies, equipment and furniture to highly effective hands-on learning curriculums. Our science brands include FOSS® (Full Option Science System), Frey Scientific®, Delta Science Module®, Delta Education®, CPO ScienceTM, and Neo/SCI®. We have structured our solutions to engage students, focusing on science and engineering practices that promote scientific inquiry, literacy and achievements, all while aligning to the Next Generation Science Standards and supporting Common Core State Standards. 
 For example, science classroom resources offered by Delta Education are focused on the pre-K to 8th-grade education level. Our science curriculum products embody the best in inquiry-based STEM education. Delta provides the research-based FOSS® curriculum and other programs such as Delta Science Module®, as well as hands-on classroom resources. FOSS has evolved from a philosophy of teaching and learning at the Lawrence Hall of Science that has guided the development of successful active learning science curricula for more than 40 years. The FOSS program bridges research and practice by providing tools and strategies to engage students and teachers in enduring experiences that lead to a deeper understanding of the natural and designed worlds. Science is a discovery activity, and our belief is that the best way for students to appreciate the scientific enterprise, learn important scientific and engineering concepts, and develop the ability to think well is to actively participate in scientific practices through the use of manipulatives which enhance their own investigations and analyses. The FOSS Program was created specifically to provide students and teachers with meaningful experiences through active participation in scientific practices. 
 For further information regarding our Distribution and Curriculum segments, see our Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

We also sell products under brands we license, such as FOSS®, ThinkMath! and FranklinCovey® Seven Habits.

 Product Development and Merchandising 
 Our product development managers apply their extensive education industry experience to design instructional solutions, supplemental curriculum and age-specific products to enhance the learning experience. New product ideas are reviewed with customer focus groups and advisory panels comprised of educators to ensure new offerings will be well received and meet an educational need. 
 Our merchandising managers continually review and update the product lines for each business. They determine whether current offerings are attractive to educators and anticipate future demand. The merchandising managers also travel to product fairs and conventions seeking out new product lines. This annual review process results in a continual reshaping and expansion of the educational materials and products we offer. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Product procurement decisions within the education market are generally made at the classroom level by teachers and curriculum specialists and at the district and school levels by administrators. The Company currently has an expansive sales force that sells our products at the classroom, school and district level to educators nationwide. 
 During 2019, our Distribution segment sales and marketing approach utilized a sales force of approximately 210 professionals, approximately 36 distinct catalog titles, and School Specialty Online®, an e-commerce solution that enables us to tailor our product offerings and pricing to individual school districts and school administrators. Over the past few years, we took steps to realign our nationwide sales team and our go-to-market strategy, which also included the expansion of an inside sales team and the implementation of a team-based selling model focused on driving growth through increased customer penetration. 
 In the Supplies category, we leverage our national sales force, which we believe represented the largest distribution network in the market in 2019, and our supply chain expertise, to reduce our customers cost of acquisition in the most commonly purchased, highest volume commodity items used by schools. In the Instruction & Intervention category, we market our products through direct marketing channels and leverage category specific sales personnel. We compete by offering deep assortments in the most commonly purchased products, by leveraging our size to reduce product costs, and by driving customer retention and acquisition through sophisticated database analytics. In the Furniture category, our unique Projects by Design® service gives us significant competitive advantages by providing customers with value-added construction management support, from interior design through installation and field support. In the non-project related segment of furniture, we capitalize on relationship selling through a direct sales force we believe was among the largest in the market in 2019. 
 Schools typically purchase educational supplies and supplemental educational products based on established relationships with relatively few vendors. We seek to establish and maintain these critical relationships by assigning accounts within a specific geographic territory to a territory sales manager who is supported by inside sales, category specialists and a customer service team. The sales managers frequently call on existing customers to ascertain and fulfill their supplemental educational resource and basic supply needs. The customer service representatives maintain contact with these customers throughout the order cycle and assist in order processing. 
 We have a national sales, marketing, distribution and customer service structure. We believe that this structure significantly improves our effectiveness through better sales management, resulting in higher regional penetration and significant cost savings through the reduction of distribution centers. 
 Projects by Design. Projects by Design® is a service we provide our customers free of charge to aid in the design, building and renovation of schools. Our professional designers prepare a detailed analysis of the building and individual classrooms to optimize the layout of student and teacher desks, student lockers and other classroom equipment and fixtures. Customers have the ability to view prospective classrooms through our innovative software in order to efficiently manage the project. We believe this service makes us an attractive alternative to other furniture and school fixture and equipment suppliers. 
 Our Curriculum segment sales and marketing approach utilizes a field sales force of approximately 30 professionals. The sales coverage is nationwide, with the largest student populated states served by a larger contingent of sales professionals. The field and inside sales associates are supported by 7 targeted catalogs and our brand-specific websites to deliver premium educational products to teachers and curriculum specialists.

 Generally, for each Curriculum product line, a major catalog containing its full product offering is distributed near the end of the calendar year and during the course of the year we mail additional supplemental catalogs. Schools, teachers and curriculum specialists can also access websites for product information and purchasing. Further, we believe that by cross marketing our Curriculum brands to Distribution customers, we can achieve substantial incremental sales. 
 Internet Operations. Our internet channel activities through www.schoolspecialty.com are focused on enhancing customer loyalty, driving down cost by receiving more orders electronically and creating a customer self-service portal. Our brands are available through our website which allows our customers a single access point for purchasing. Our systems provide functionality to meet the specific needs of school districts and school customers, who generally purchase Distribution products, as well as the needs of individual teachers and curriculum specialists, who tend to buy Curriculum products. Our website allows our customers to manage funding through the use of purchase order spending limits, approval workflows, order management and reporting. In addition, we offer schools and school districts the ability to fully integrate their procurement systems with our website, which gives us another important link to our customers and a significant competitive advantage. It also includes other features that are more helpful to teachers, curriculum specialists and others with more sophisticated online ordering needs, including product search, custom catalogs and email notification, allowing users to have access to the full line of School Specialty products. We have maintained an electronic ordering system for the past 20 years and offer e-commerce solutions directed exclusively at the education market. Each of our Curriculum product lines has a dedicated website for its own products. We also continue to explore expanding our offerings provided through third party internet sources. As such, we have a relationship with Amazon.com under which we offer our propriety branded products through the Amazon.com shopping portal. We believe that this channel allows us to reach educators, consumers and segments of the education space that we did not reach previously. Over the past two years, we have significantly invested in our ecommerce platform to improve website functionality, make the online ordering process easier and faster and improve the overall customer experience, which we believe will help us grow organically. 
 Pricing. Pricing for our Distribution and Curriculum product offerings varies by product and market channel. We generally offer a negotiated discount from catalog or list prices for products from our Distribution catalogs and respond to quote and bid requests. The pricing structure of proprietary Curriculum products offered through direct marketing is generally less subject to negotiation. 
Procurement 
 Non-Proprietary Products. Each year, we add new items to our catalogs and our offerings. We begin to purchase and stock these items before the catalogs are released so that we can immediately satisfy customer demand. We typically purchase under annual supply agreements with our vendors. For our larger vendors we typically negotiate annual contracts that usually provide negotiated pricing and/or extended terms and often include volume discounts and rebate programs. We have exclusive distribution rights on several furniture and equipment lines. 
 Proprietary Products. We develop many proprietary products and generally outsource the manufacturing of these items. 
 Global Sourcing. We are decreasing our product unit costs by consolidating our international supplier network. We are also improving product quality by being very selective in our sourcing relationships. Working in conjunction with our supply partners, we have streamlined our international procurement process, gained real-time visibility, added in-process quality checks, and established new systems and procedures to ensure product safety. 
 Private Label Product. We launched the School Smart® brand in 2005. Since that time, we have focused our strategy on providing a private brand alternative for educators, using a combination of off-shoring and out-sourcing of products. In fiscal 2019, our revenue for School Smart branded products was approximately $51 million. We continue to evaluate the balance of branded and private brand products and we believe that there are additional opportunities to grow sales through new products, product line extensions and new product configurations. 
 We strive to maintain close and stable relationships with our vendors to facilitate a streamlined procurement process. At the same time, we continually review alternative supply sources in an effort to improve quality and customer satisfaction and reduce product cost. Increasingly, transactions with our vendors are processed through an electronic procurement process. This electronic process reduces costs and improves accuracy and efficiency in our procurement and fulfillment process. When more than one of our business units buys from the same vendor, we typically negotiate one contract to fully leverage our combined purchasing power.

 Logistics 
 We believe we have one of the largest and most sophisticated distribution networks among our direct competitors with three fully automated and seamlessly integrated distribution centers, two supporting the Distribution segment and one supporting the Curriculum segment, totaling approximately one million square feet of operating space. We believe this network represents a significant competitive advantage, allowing us to reach any school in a fast and efficient fashion. We have enhanced our distribution model, allowing most of our customers to receive their orders of in-stock items within 3 to 5 days, and, through third party strategic relationships, have the ability to offer next-day delivery for many items We utilize a third-party logistics provider in Asia to consolidate inbound shipments of items sourced overseas, lowering our transportation and inventory storage costs. 
 In order to maintain the proprietary nature of certain furniture products, we operate one manufacturing facility. Our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant manufactures wood furniture for our early childhood offerings. Products that we manufacture accounted for less than 10% of sales during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. 
 Over the past three years, through a series of initiatives, we have realigned our Distribution Centers and warehouses to efficiently serve the majority of our customers and effectively access key suppliers. We have also invested significantly in lean manufacturing principles and upgraded technology and logistics platforms, which have strengthened our operational footprint, enabling us to provide better, more accurate and faster shipments to our customers. This remains one of our key corporate priorities. 
 Information Systems 
 We believe that through the utilization of technology for process improvement in areas such as procurement, inventory management, customer order management, order fulfillment, and information management, we are able to offer customers more convenient and cost-effective ways to order products, improve the order fulfillment process to increase on-time and complete performance and effectively focus our sales and marketing strategies. 
 We have implemented a common enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform across all of our businesses. This platform primarily includes software from Oracles E-Business suite. One of the major benefits from the common ERP platform is the consolidation of both product and customer information, which is designed to enhance our ability to execute our sales and marketing strategies. In addition, by utilizing common business systems across the Company, we have improved business processes, reduced cycle time and enhanced integration between the business units. We believe the technologies of the systems will readily support continued growth and integration of our existing businesses. Our distribution centers utilize interfaced warehouse management software to manage orders from our ERP and legacy systems. 
 Competition 
 The supplemental educational products and equipment market is highly fragmented with many retail and wholesale companies providing products and equipment, many of which are family- or employee-owned, regional companies. We also compete, to a much lesser extent, with alternate channel competitors such as office product contract stationers, office supply superstores, purchasing cooperatives and internet-based businesses. Their primary advantages over us include size, location, greater financial resources and purchasing power. Their primary disadvantage is that their product mix typically covers less of a schools overall needs (measured by volume). We believe we compete favorably with these companies on the basis of service, product offering and customer reach. The standards-based curriculum market is highly competitive, and School Specialty competes with several large, well-known education companies as well as small, niche companies.

 As of March 6, 2020, we had approximately 1,136 full-time employees. Since the beginning of fiscal 2015, we have reduced the number of full-time employees by over 200 as we have integrated and aligned core function areas across the Company, such as operations, supply chain management, procurement and logistics, marketing, finance, information technology and human resources. Additionally, to meet the seasonal demands of our customers, we employ many seasonal employees during the late spring and summer months. Historically, we have been able to meet our requirements for seasonal employment. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Backlog 
 We had no material backlog at December 28, 2019. Our customers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis.
