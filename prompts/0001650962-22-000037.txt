ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
Welbilt, Inc. ("Welbilt", the "Company", "we", "us" "our") was incorporated in Delaware in 2015 and became publicly traded in March 2016 after a spin-off from The Manitowoc Company, Inc. ("MTW"). Welbilt is one of the world's leading commercial foodservice equipment companies currently leveraging a full suite of equipment capable of storing, cooking, holding, displaying, dispensing and serving in both hot and cold foodservice categories. We are headquartered in New Port Richey, Florida, and operate 19 manufacturing facilities globally.
We design, manufacture and supply best-in-class equipment for the global commercial foodservice market, which is used by commercial and institutional foodservice operators including full-service restaurants, quick-service restaurant ("QSR") chains, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, caterers, supermarkets, convenience stores, hospitals, schools and other institutions. We sell our products in each of our geographical segments, the Americas, EMEA and APAC, through a global network of over 5,000 distributors, dealers, buying groups and manufacturers' representatives (individually and collectively, "channel partners"). 
Our portfolio of award-winning product brands includes Cleveland™, Convotherm®, Crem®, Delfield®, Frymaster®, Garland®, Kolpak®, Lincoln™, Manitowoc® Ice, Merco®, Merrychef® and Multiplex®. These product brands are supported by three service brands: FitKitchen®, our fully-integrated kitchen systems business, KitchenConnect®, our digital cloud-based application offering, and KitchenCare®, our aftermarket parts and service business. Through these operations, we provide our customers with a full portfolio of products, platforms and solutions specific to meet our customers' needs, drive brand loyalty and maintain high customer satisfaction. With our in-house culinary staff and skilled engineers, we are also able to develop innovative solutions and tailor our product offerings to support our customers’ evolving menu choices and strategic plans, which serves to further strengthen our customer relationships. 
We intend to achieve sustainable growth globally and drive increased profitability by leveraging our position as a leading commercial foodservice equipment provider, growing our customer base, expanding the frontiers of foodservice innovation and continuing to attract and grow industry-leading talent. We may explore acquisition opportunities, which will complement our product lines, allow us to expand our presence in international markets, enable us to leverage our distribution capabilities, provide us with selective technologies and/or otherwise support the expansion of our business in a manner that is consistent with our strategic goals. 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
Global economic conditions will continue to be volatile as long as the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health threat. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus and new strains of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, curfews, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, vaccination mandates, social distancing measures and mandated business limitations and closures. These measures have resulted in a disruption in the foodservice industry, including substantial restaurant closures and, as a result, in commercial foodservice equipment markets across the geographies in which we operate. We expect global economic performance and the performance of our businesses to vary by geography and discipline until the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy subsides.
Our Company's 2021 net sales, earnings from operations and cash flows all improved significantly in comparison to 2020. While the commercial foodservice industry has continued to recover from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain disturbances and shipping and logistics delays, on our operational and financial performance will depend significantly on future developments, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain, mitigate or recover from its impact in each of the countries where we operate globally (including actions taken to ease supply chain backlogs), the vaccination rates and efficacy, emergence of new strains of the virus, and the timing of the resumption of economic activity to pre-pandemic levels.
Throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to see increases in the cost of specific commodities, components and parts purchased, as well as in the average cost of commodities, components and parts purchased, as compared to the prior year, driven both by rising inflation rates and rising tariffs, as challenges in the supply chain and shipping and logistics delays continued to persist. The availability of key electronic components used in embedded electronic controls diminished in 2021, and we expended significant effort and resources to utilize available parts and to source these electronic components on the spot market, often at a large premium to historical prices.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was enacted in March 2020 and includes measures intended to assist companies during the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws, some of which had been enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") in 2017. As a result of the Tax Act and the CARES Act, additional legislative and regulatory guidance has been and may continue to be issued, including final regulations that could impact our effective tax rate in future periods.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended eligibility for the employee retention tax credit for qualified wages paid from January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021. We were not eligible for this incentive during the year ended December 31, 2021.

On November 5th, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced an emergency temporary standard mandating the COVID-19 vaccine or weekly testing for most U.S. employees, which includes our employees. That standard was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court on January 13, 2022. However, the Biden Administration has indicated that it may seek to impose alternative vaccine mandates and other governmental authorities have imposed more targeted vaccine and testing orders and regulations, and may continue to do so in the future. If a mandate is ultimately issued and implemented in some form, we expect there would be further disruptions to our operations, such as inability to maintain adequate staffing at our facilities, difficulties in replacing disqualified employees with temporary employees or new hires, increased costs and diminished availability of raw materials and component parts, and increased compliance burdens, including financial costs, diversion of administrative resources, and increased downtimes to accommodate for any required ongoing COVID-19 testing, which would result in delays in the manufacturing process, negatively impact our future sales levels and ongoing customer relationships.
We continue to proactively monitor the developments surrounding COVID-19 and may take additional actions based on the requirements and recommendations of governmental and health authorities around the world in an attempt to protect our stakeholders. Although we are currently unable to quantify with certainty the ultimate severity or duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we expect that the challenges in the supply chain and shipping and logistics delays will likely have a continued impact on our operating results and financial condition throughout fiscal 2022.
Our History
Our heritage in the commercial foodservice equipment industry stretches back over a century. In 1929, Henry and Alexander Hirsch established the Welbilt Stove Co., which acquired foodservice equipment companies like Garland and Cleveland that had a history dating as far back as the mid-1800s. Our business has grown through strategic and transformational acquisitions of brands that have been integrated to become a foodservice equipment company offering a broad line of product solutions for commercial kitchens. We have also grown organically with expansion of these acquired brands through our long-standing customer relationships that have spanned decades. Coupled with our focus on research and development, innovation, and superior customer service, we have become an industry-leading provider of commercial foodservice equipment. 
In October 2008, our former parent, MTW, completed the acquisition of Enodis plc, a global leader in equipment manufacturing for the foodservice industry, for $2.7 billion. With this acquisition, our equipment portfolio expanded to include refrigeration, ice-making, cooking, food preparation, and beverage-dispensing technologies.
In January 2015, MTW announced plans to create two independent public companies to separately operate its two businesses: its crane business and its foodservice business. On March 4, 2016, we spun off from MTW and publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the name Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. Effective March 6, 2017, we renamed the Company to Welbilt, Inc. and rebranded our logo and brand identity to "Welbilt" as part of our strategic repositioning and long-standing commitment to our customers.
In April 2018, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Avaj International Holding AB, whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Crem International Holding AB ("Crem") develops, manufactures and markets a full suite of commercial coffee machines for use in offices, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, catering services and convenience stores, for a purchase price of $220.3 million. This acquisition provided us with an established presence in the complementary product category of hot beverage equipment, the potential for operational synergies and cross-selling benefits and an increased presence in both Europe and Asia.
Merger with Ali Holding S.r.l.
On July 14, 2021,Welbilt and Ali Holding S.r.l. (“Ali Group”), a significant and diversified global foodservice equipment manufacturer and distributor, entered into a merger agreement under which Ali Group will acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for $24.00 per share, or approximately $3.5 billion in aggregate equity value and $4.8 billion in enterprise value. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the Company's board of directors and on September 30, 2021, was approved by our stockholders. 
In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and immediately prior to the merger:
(i) all of the Company's outstanding and unvested common stock options and restricted stock units will become vested and exchanged for the right to receive cash equal to the $24.00 per share consideration (less the exercise price per share of common stock for the common stock options), and
(ii)    all of the Company's outstanding performance share units will also be exchanged, as determined assuming the maximum level of performance is achieved, for the right to receive cash equal to the $24.00 per share consideration, 
Upon completion of the transaction, the Company's shares will no longer trade on The New York Stock Exchange.

The Ali Group merger agreement provides that the Company may be required to pay Ali Group a termination fee equal to $110.0 million if the merger agreement is terminated:
(a) by Ali Group due to a breach of a covenant or agreement by the Company that causes the failure of a condition to closing, or
(b) by either party if the Merger has not been consummated prior to July 14, 2022 (subject to extension if certain approvals have not been obtained by such date) or
if, in the case of clauses (a) or (b), an alternative proposal has been publicly disclosed, announced or otherwise made public and has not been withdrawn and within twelve months of such termination our company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an alternative proposal. 
Welbilt and Ali Group have submitted regulatory filings in all required jurisdictions, including the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union. The companies have decided that they will proceed with divesting the Company's Manitowoc ice brand ( the "Ice Business,") and the companies are confident that this step will ensure regulatory approval. 
In October 2021, the Company's board of directors concluded that outside consultants should be authorized to commence a process that could result in the sale of the Ice Business. Our outside consultants, with the assistance of management, have initiated the marketing and due diligence process for the Ice divestiture. The companies expect to complete Ice divestiture in the first half of 2022 with the acquisition of Welbilt by Ali Group to close shortly thereafter.
As of December 31, 2021, we concluded that the Ice business does not meet the criteria to be classified as an asset held for sale or its operations to be classified as discontinued operations in accordance with the applicable accounting literature.
Key milestones in our history are depicted below.
Our Markets
Our global footprint positions us to capitalize on growth in both developed and emerging markets, as our full-line of hot and cold foodservice products, systems and services are sold in more than 100 countries. We manage our business in three geographic business segments: Americas, EMEA and APAC. The Americas segment includes the United States ("U.S."), Canada and Latin America. The EMEA segment consists of markets in Europe, including Middle East, Russia, Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The APAC segment consists primarily of markets in China, India, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Vietnam. 
Based on consolidated net sales by destination for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $1,546.9 million, approximately 37% of our consolidated net sales were generated outside the U.S, with approximately 69% of our revenue generated from customers within the Americas, approximately 19% from EMEA customers and approximately 12% from APAC customers, in each case after giving effect to the elimination of intersegment sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had one customer that represented more than 10% of our consolidated net sales; with sales totaling $167.6 million, across all three of our reportable segments. There were no other direct customers, which includes both channel partners and large chain accounts, that represented 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of our direct customers represented 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.

Strategic Objectives
While our strategic objectives are long-term and remain intact, the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact the extent and timing of the execution of these objectives. Our immediate focus remains on ensuring the safety of our stakeholders and the balancing productivity gains and the execution of our cost reduction initiatives implemented during our Business Transformation Program ("Transformation Program") and innovation investments with the pace of recovery in our revenues as the industry rebounds. Our specific strategic objectives for the long-term include:
Achieve profitable growth
We intend to grow sales organically with our best-in-class foodservice equipment portfolio of products and an integrated kitchen solution approach. While organic growth across all three of our geographic segments is our first priority, we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships as our capital structure allows in the future. Our industry is fragmented, and we believe there is significant opportunity for consolidation through acquisitions, partnerships and other strategic relationships to drive growth.
Selected initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:
•Product branding and value proposition: We believe that leveraging our individual brand identities allows us to better differentiate ourselves through customer preference enabling deeper customer relationships and in turn produces a competitive advantage. Our customer insight at the brand level enables us to innovate quickly and bring category leading products to market in order to capture sales in higher growth segments.
•Breadth and Go-to-Market approach: Our goal is to improve each customer's experience by effectively going to market as a portfolio of brands offering a broad line of foodservice equipment solutions, thus making it easier for customers to do business with us. Our breadth of product line and global scale allows us to pursue multi-product solutions for a given channel and more fully leverage technologies across our product categories, both of which increase our customer loyalty.
•Identify potential targets for acquisitions and strategic partnerships: We seek to identify, analyze and assess potential targets for acquisitions and partnerships to establish a presence in new markets, supplement our current product offerings or acquire technologies that can be leveraged in our existing product portfolio.
Create innovative products and solutions 
To remain an industry leader and grow our reputation as an innovative company, we continuously develop dynamic product and system solutions for the entire kitchen. We leverage our suppliers and customers to actively address product competitiveness and life cycle extensions. We co-create innovation and refresh existing products with new, locally relevant food-inspiring technologies, while simultaneously finding new ways to integrate those technologies into global platforms in a cost-effective manner and create cohesive kitchen systems for our customers.

•KitchenCare parts and service: Growing our parts and service business to capture a larger market share and further integrate the full solutions offering to our customers to support reduced operator downtime thereby increasing the profitability of our customers. 
Drive operational excellence
We are focused on productivity gains and cost reductions across our business and plan to continue to leverage our global footprint to drive greater efficiencies across our operations. We are executing these cost reduction initiatives through our Transformation Program, which was launched in the second quarter of 2019 and completed during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The Transformation Program was executed in multiple phases and was focused on specific areas of opportunity including strategic sourcing, manufacturing facility workflow redesign, select manufacturing footprint consolidation and distribution and administrative process efficiencies. Going forward, we will continue to execute on the initiatives identified during our Business Transformation and leverage the capabilities and approaches developed in that program. The operational improvements made at all of our facilities through our Transformation Program helped us accelerate our post-COVID production ramp-up capabilities throughout 2021.
Selected initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:
•Global sourcing initiative: Ensuring suppliers are able to provide parts to us at competitive costs and lead times. We have established a procurement center of excellence that leverages our global scale, manages critical vendors and deploys best practices, while developing stronger brand-based procurement capabilities at each of our manufacturing facilities.
•Facility rationalization and lean manufacturing: Reducing excess capacity in our network of global manufacturing facilities, implementing lean principles including Value Analysis Value Engineering initiatives in all operations and incorporating production systems that embed continuous improvement into the culture of our manufacturing processes. 
•Quality excellence: Ensuring we deliver high quality products by prioritizing quality and supply chain excellence in all aspects of production, from new product introduction to global manufacturing.

Develop great people
We strive to make Welbilt an employer of choice in our industry. We believe that we demonstrate a strong commitment to our people by providing a diverse and inclusive culture and environment where employee input, efforts and achievements are recognized and valued.
Selected current initiatives supporting this strategic objective include:
•Talent and succession program: Focused development through tailored programs for our top talent with key succession planning identified through a robust talent assessment process.
•Rewards strategy: A total rewards program that recognizes outstanding employee achievements and measurable results in leadership, individual and organizational performance, innovation, and positive culture change that support the values and strategic goals of the business and attracts as well as retains talent.
Our Product and Service Portfolio
We serve our customers using a complementary portfolio of brands integrated under one company. Our commercial foodservice equipment capabilities span storing, cooking, holding, displaying, dispensing and serving technologies. The breadth of our portfolio allows us to meet the needs of entire commercial kitchens and serve the world’s growing demand for food prepared away from home, including the recent growth in "ghost kitchens", which are professional cooking facilities created for the preparation of delivery-only meals which have enabled restaurants to rapidly initiate food delivery services to their customers. 
Our foodservice equipment brands include the following within each of our product categories: 
•Storing. We design, manufacture and sell commercial upright and undercounter refrigerators and freezers, blast freezers, blast chillers and cook-chill systems under the Delfield brand name. We manufacture modular and fully assembled walk-in refrigerators, coolers and freezers, and prefabricated cooler and freezer panels for use in the construction of refrigerated storage rooms and environmental systems under the Kolpak brand name. 
•Cooking. We sell traditional ovens, combination ovens, convection ovens, conveyor ovens, rapid-cooking ovens, range and grill products under the Convotherm, Garland, Lincoln, Merrychef and other brand names. We market fryers and frying systems principally under the Frymaster brand name, and our steam equipment under the Cleveland brand.
•Holding and Displaying. We design, manufacture and sell a range of cafeteria and buffet equipment stations, bins, boxes, warming cabinets, warmers, display and deli cases, and insulated and refrigerated salad and food bars. We market our equipment stations, cases, food bars and food serving lines under the Delfield, Merco and other brand names.
•Dispensing and Serving. We produce beverage dispensers, blended ice machines, ice/beverage dispensers, beer coolers, post-mix dispensing valves, backroom equipment and support system components and related equipment for use by QSR chains, convenience stores, bottling operations, movie theaters, the soft-drink industry and others. We design, manufacture and sell ice machines under the Manitowoc and other brand names. We sell our coffee equipment under the Crem brand name and other beverage-related products under the Multiplex and Manitowoc brand names.
Our foodservice equipment brands are augmented through the following cross-portfolio service offerings:
•FitKitchen. We produce kitchen systems and solutions for our chain customers that optimize the use of our customers' kitchen space through the introduction and benefits of our portfolio of brands, products and technologies. The goal of FitKitchen is to provide customized solutions that reduces the kitchen footprint and right-sizes equipment in order to reduce capital costs while producing improvements in speed of service, quality of food, and labor costs.
•KitchenConnect. Our KitchenConnect enabled products include the option for data output monitoring intended to facilitate menu management by the equipment operators through the interaction of menus and equipment. We believe that these products produce an operator experience that allows for a collaborative and agile service supported by just-in-time maintenance. We believe this reduces downtime, optimizes energy use and improves service response time. 
•KitchenCare. We provide a broad range of services and after-market parts and manage a comprehensive factory-authorized service network, assuring proper installation and start-up, preventative maintenance, after-market parts supply and maximum equipment operating time on all of our products.

-12-


Digitalization and Connectivity
•KitchenConnect 3.0 - Our award-winning open-cloud solution for the commercial food service industry provides an overview of the operator's menu, products cooked, product peak demand hours, product utilization, and product maintenance diagnostics, which improves operator efficiency, reduces equipment downtime (ultimately reducing costs), and enhances food quality through real-time operator data visualization. We frequently add new functionality and capabilities to KitchenConnect based on user needs and experience as we focus on continuous improvement to the digital experience of our equipment.
•Common Controller Platform - Making "Born Digital" the new standard for our products, out Common Controller Platform provides a common user interface to control equipment in a consistent manner across each of our equipment offerings, providing for operator level ease-of-use and reduced workforce training requirements. The Common Controller Platform also establishes connectivity to KitchenConnect, and the customer's broader systems infrastructure, resulting in reduced labor and supply costs for our customers. We believe this enhances our equipment as one of the easiest to use in the commercial foodservice industry. The use of a single user interface device across all brands leverages our combined volume across all brands and reduces the number of suppliers required.
•KitchenConnect Virtual Oil Quality Sensor - Virtual oil quality sensor is based in artificial intelligence and designed to create a predictive model used to monitor the quality of the cooking oil in our equipment and advise operators when to discard the oil, eliminating the "discard dilemma", resulting in improved food quality and customer satisfaction. This technology replaces conventional oil sensing hardware that is often prone to failure resulting in increased downtime and operator cost.
Additional key products and product upgrades introduced during 2021 include: 
•Garland XHP Broiler – XHP (Extra High Performance) is a new heavy-duty countertop broiler platform that uses patented SynergyTM technology. We believe the XHP Broiler is revolutionizing the industry with its high power and low-energy consumption design, enabling customers to prepare (meat, fish and vegetables) faster while using as much as 50% less gas than a traditional charbroiler. With a novel gas burner and heat dispersal system in which air is mixed with gas, ignited and vortexed under the food-delivering even ultra high heat output. Intensity of the heat causes cooking byproducts to vaporize, giving the food more flavor and significantly reducing the need for daily cleaning.
•Convotherm Maxx Pro – Building on the successful launch of Convothem Maxx in 2020, Maxx Pro introduces new technology into Convotherm’s leading countertop portfolio. The new Maxx Pro retains the premium cooking performance and feature mix of Convotherm Maxx, but additionally includes LED cooking chamber lighting, a triple glazed low energy glass door and a new 10” Welbilt Common Controller. 
•Manitowoc Galileo – This CrystalCraft Premier undercounter ice machine produces clear individually formed 1.5” ice cubes, designed to melt slowly for use specifically with whiskeys and hand-crafted premium cocktails. The product was named a 2021 Kitchen Innovations Award winner by the National Restaurant Association.
•Delfield SMART – Delfield’s new smart range of equipment is intended to provide improved customer solutions for front-of-house serving lines in various market segment, including schools, colleges and universities, casinos, business and industry, and healthcare. In order to bring this to market faster, different parts of the portfolio will be brought to market over time, including enhanced Flexishield, FlexiWell Gen2, increased induction offerings, AutoFill options, FlexiTop, beverage coolers and ozone sanitization. 
•Lincoln 2424 – The new 2424 is the first in a new family of premium gas/electric conveyor impinger ovens from Lincoln. This touchscreen-controlled compact unit features class high culinary performance, ease of use, reliability, cleaning and serviceability features. The 2424 is the midsize model within what we expect will be a new and expanded product offer planned to be launched in the coming years. 
•Garland DSG2 – The new DSG2 is a based on the Garland Double-Sided-Grill. The DSG2 includes ‘Active Compression’, the new Welbilt 7” Common Controller and improved in-field product reliability. Active compression is a new feature allowing the recipe (stored on the controller) to precisely manage the evenness and the amount of compression applied to the food during cooking, thus providing reduced cook times and improved food quality. 
•Merco Flow-Thru Order Pickup Locker - The new OrderHQ™ series of foodservice lockers addresses our customer’s biggest order pickup challenges by reducing employee labor, giving customers a fast, contactless experience, and providing new data to optimize order pickup processes. 
•FilterQuick 120 - The product was named a 2021 Kitchen Innovations Award winner by the National Restaurant Association. Automatic filtration fryers have been commonly used with freezer-to-fryer products that produce significantly less sediment. Until now, the heavy wet sediment that is inherent when cooking bone-in chicken was dependent on a manual filtration process. Using multiple return ports to direct the flushing of sediment, Frymaster created a large frypot capable of automatically filtering heavy sediment. Additionally, the FilterQuick 120 leveraged the capabilities of our touchscreen controller and automatic internet connection to simplify fryer operations.

Engineering, Research and Development
We have a staff of engineers and technicians, supplemented with external engineering resources, who are collectively responsible for the continual improvements of our existing products and the development of new products. We incurred total engineering costs of $49.5 million, $42.3 million and $47.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which included research and development costs of $42.5 million, $36.1 million and $41.3 million, respectively.
Customers and Distribution Channels
Our end customer base consists of a wide variety of foodservice providers, including full-service restaurants, QSRs, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, convenience stores, retail stores, supermarkets, leisure and convention facilities, healthcare facilities, schools and universities and many other foodservice outlets (collectively "end customers"). Our end customers range from large, multinational chain operators to independently owned establishments. We have the scale to serve the largest global customers and market expertise to leverage our international presence, along with an experienced and dedicated sales force, to sell directly to multinational and national chain customers.
To ensure our products reach our broad end customer base and promote our product offerings and our portfolio of equipment brands, we distribute our products through a variety of distribution channels. Our distribution network includes an expansive network of channel partners located in over 100 countries worldwide. We believe our distribution network has strengthened in recent years as we have continued to enhance our positive relationships with our channel partners and have demonstrated our customer-centric strategy. In addition, we sell original equipment manufacturer replacement parts through factory authorized service providers. 
Competition and Market Conditions 
We sell all our products in highly competitive markets and compete based on product design, quality, performance, aftermarket support services, as well as maintenance costs and equipment price. Through 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic created a decline in economic activity across the globe. Many hospitality and restaurant companies were forced to close either temporarily or permanently, and the vast majority have experienced a significant decline in revenues. The effects on businesses across many industries was pervasive and has injected uncertainty into the consumer foodservice industry. Full-service restaurants continue the trend as being the most negatively impacted by COVID-19 with limited-service restaurants (which includes QSR and fast casual restaurants) impacted the least. Many economic forecasts continue to show that sales in the consumer foodservice industries will not return to 2019 levels until 2023.
We believe our comprehensive offering of highly innovative and high-quality products and services provides us with the following competitive advantages:
•a complementary portfolio of industry-leading hot and cold food products, as well as cold beverage and coffee products, which are integrated under one operating company and supported by aftermarket parts, service and technical support;
•the ability to integrate food, equipment, digital technologies and people seamlessly through collaborative innovation that enhances our customers’ ability to compete in the marketplace;
•the scale and breadth of our distributor and dealer network to consistently deliver our products to our customers as they expand their operations globally, including into the fast-growing emerging markets;
•long-standing equipment brands and innovative engineering that customers can trust for superior quality and reliability; and
•dedication to prioritizing the customer experience.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property assets, including our patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, are important to our business. We hold numerous patents pertaining to our products and have applications pending for additional patents in the United States and various foreign countries. In addition, we have various registered and unregistered trademarks and licenses that are of material importance to our business. We believe our ownership of this intellectual property is adequately protected in customary fashions under applicable laws. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.
Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio provides:
•global protection of our research and development efforts and product development investments, 
•recognizable competitive distinctions and proprietary advantages, 
•brand support and enhancement; and 
•leverage for value creation opportunities such as licenses.

We take efforts to protect, enforce and defend our intellectual property and proprietary rights, as appropriate.
Seasonality
Typically, the first quarter of our fiscal year represents the least favorable period for our financial results while the third quarter of our fiscal year typically is the most favorable. Our customers are primarily located in the northern hemisphere, where the warmer summer weather generally leads to increased levels of construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry. As a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, these general trends were disrupted throughout the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Raw Materials and Component Parts
We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners where appropriate. The primary raw materials that we use in the manufacturing of our products are rolled steel, aluminum, and copper, all of which are generally available in adequate quantities from numerous suppliers, although we cannot predict their future availability. Our raw materials can also be susceptible to currency and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, government regulations, tariffs, and other unforeseen circumstances. We strive to maintain alternative sources of supplies and materials when possible, but some material parts and key components we use in the manufacturing of our products are obtained from sole supply sources. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced interruptions in the availability of raw materials, including intermittent shortages of component parts and reduced freight capacities, as well as price increases in raw materials. Our supply chain experienced disruptions through the year ended December 31, 2021, but to date, none of these disruptions have resulted in significant production delays.
While the commercial foodservice industry has continued to gradually recover from the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic, including through supply chain disturbances and shipping and logistics delays, on our operational and financial performance will depend significantly on future developments, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain, mitigate or recover from its impact in each of the countries where we operate globally (including actions taken to ease supply chain backlogs), the vaccination rates and efficacy, emergence of new strains of the virus, and the timing of the resumption of economic activity to pre-pandemic levels.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,800 employees, which includes workforce resources from six employee unions in North America, two trade unions and a local works council in Europe and two trade unions in China. We believe our overall relations with our workforce are positive and that the strength of our workforce is a critical success factor as a leader in the commercial foodservice equipment industry. Our employees share an entrepreneurial spirit, a passion for excellence and the inspiration to drive the future of the commercial foodservice equipment industry. Our core values are Integrity, Passion, Teamwork, Entrepreneurship and Accountability. In addition to the initiatives discussed under "Strategic Objectives" above, we continually focus on the following areas in order to ensure the continued strength and well-being of our workforce:
•Health and Safety: The safety and health of our employees is of paramount importance. Our facilities and operations use proven tools and systems to identify hazards and mitigate risk. We emphasize learning from past incidents and continuously review and improve our safety programs. We require that all incidents be reported, recorded and investigated in order to identify the root cause and prevent recurrence. We also expect our suppliers to commit to safety through the training and implementation of processes to prevent, detect and respond to safety and health risks that may impact our employees through a supplier code of conduct. 
•Diversity and Inclusion: We value and embrace diversity by fostering a culture that encompasses the unique attributes, ideas, perspectives, and experiences of our employees, customers, suppliers and communities. We believe that in a global marketplace, a more inclusive and diverse work environment allows us to achieve better results and makes us a stronger business.
•Employee Engagement: We strive to create a workplace where employees feel engaged, believe in our mission, understand their role in our strategy and are passionate about the work they do. We conduct employee engagement surveys to provide us with valuable insights into employee perspectives and experiences. We also hold quarterly global town-hall meetings to provide necessary Company updates, celebrate milestones in the business, communicate initiatives, recognize significant individual accomplishments and provide a forum for employees to communicate and engage with executive leadership.
