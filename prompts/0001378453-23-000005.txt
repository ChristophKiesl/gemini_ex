Item 1. Business
Business Overview
TravelCenters of America Inc. is a Maryland corporation. As of December 31, 2022, we operate or franchise 285 travel centers, standalone truck service facilities and standalone restaurants. Our customers include trucking fleets and their drivers, independent truck drivers, highway and local motorists and casual diners. We also collect rents, royalties and other fees from our tenants and franchisees.
As of December 31, 2022, our business included 281 travel centers in 44 states in the United States, primarily along the U.S. interstate highway system, operated primarily under the “TravelCenters of America,” “TA,” “TA Express,” “Petro Stopping Centers” and “Petro” brand names. Of these travel centers, we owned 56, we leased 181, we operated two for a joint venture and 42 were owned or leased from others by our franchisees. We operated 239 of our travel centers and franchisees operated 42 travel centers. Our travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as a wide range of truck repair and maintenance services, diesel exhaust fluid, or DEF, full service restaurants, or FSRs, quick service restaurants, or QSRs, and various customer amenities.
As of December 31, 2022, our business included three standalone truck service facilities operated under the “TA Truck Service” brand name. Of these standalone truck service facilities, we leased two and owned one. Our standalone truck service facilities offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and roadside services to large trucks.
On April 21, 2021, we completed the sale of our Quaker Steak & Lube, or QSL, business for $5.0 million excluding costs to sell and certain closing adjustments. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about the sale of our QSL business.
We manage our business as one segment. We make specific disclosures concerning fuel and nonfuel products and services because they facilitate our discussion of trends and operational initiatives within our business and industry. In March 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our only travel center located in a foreign country, Canada, which we did not consider material to our operations, and on April 26, 2022, we ceased all operations at our Canadian travel center. In December 2022, due to circumstances that were considered unlikely at the time the agreement was executed, we exercised our right to terminate the agreement. As a result, we are actively seeking other buyers for the property. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about the closure of this travel center.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 15,000 people on a full time basis and 2,500 people on a part time basis at our travel centers, standalone truck service facilities and standalone restaurants and we employed an additional 945 people in field management, corporate and other roles to support our locations. Approximately 48 of our employees at three travel centers are represented by unions. For more information regarding our employees, please refer to “Human Capital Resources” below.
Recent Significant Events
The Proposed Merger
On February 15, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with BP, Bluestar RTM Inc., a Maryland corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BP, or Merger Subsidiary, pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company, or the Merger, with the Company surviving the Merger.
As a result of the Merger, at the effective time of the Merger, or the Effective Time, each share of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of our common stock (i) owned by BP or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) held by any Subsidiary (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Company or BP (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time), will be converted into the right to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest, or the Merger Consideration.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of our common stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions under any Company stock plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will vest in full and become free of such restrictions and will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration under the same terms and conditions as apply to the receipt of the Merger Consideration by holders of our common stock generally.
The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) receipt by us of the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) that there is no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment issued by any court of competent jurisdiction in effect enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and all other approvals under antitrust laws, (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (subject to specified materiality qualifiers), (v) compliance with the covenants and obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; (vi) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the Company; and (vii) the execution, release and delivery of the Consent and Amendment Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2023, by and among us, our subsidiary TA Operating LLC, BP, SVC and certain of SVC’s subsidiaries, and all agreements entered into pursuant thereto.
We made customary representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and agreed to customary covenants regarding the operation of our business and the business of our subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.
The Merger Agreement also includes a covenant requiring us not to solicit any acquisition proposal, and, subject to certain exceptions, not to enter into or participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, related to an acquisition proposal or enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to an acquisition proposal. Further, our Board of Directors will not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, its recommendation in a manner adverse to BP, adopt, approve or recommend to our stockholders an acquisition proposal, fail to reaffirm its recommendation within ten business days following BP’s written request, fail to recommend against acceptance of a tender or exchange offer for shares of our common stock within ten business days after the commencement thereof, nor fail to include its recommendation in the proxy statement that will be prepared in connection with the company stockholder meeting and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding these restrictions, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if we have received a written, bona fide, unsolicited acquisition proposal from any third party (or a group of third parties) that our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, and the failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable law, then we, directly or indirectly through certain specified representatives, may, subject to certain conditions, engage in discussions with such third party and furnish to such third party non-public information relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement. Further, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in respect to a superior proposal we receive after the date of the Merger Agreement on an unsolicited basis, if our board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable law, the board of directors may, subject to compliance with certain conditions, (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or (ii) cause us to terminate the Merger Agreement in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a binding written definitive agreement providing for such superior proposal.
Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the closing of the Merger, we expect the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to occur by mid-year 2023.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on February 16, 2023.
Economic Conditions
The United States economy experienced high inflation since the beginning of 2022 and there are market expectations that inflation may further increase and remain at elevated levels for a sustained period. In addition, global supply chain challenges that arose during the second half of 2021 continued in 2022 and, although improvements have since been realized, it is uncertain whether those improvements will be continued and sustained. Also, labor availability has continued to be constrained and market labor costs have continued to increase. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board also increased interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022 and once in 2023, with additional rate increases expected in 2023. These conditions may give rise to an economic slowdown, and perhaps a recession, and could further increase our costs and/or impact our revenues. At the same time, these conditions and other factors, as further noted below, have created a volatile market for oil, diesel fuel and gasoline, which resulted in our realizing increased fuel margins and fuel revenues during 2022. It is unclear whether the current economic conditions and government responses to these conditions, including inflation, increasing interest rates, the war between Russia and Ukraine and high fuel prices, will result in an economic slowdown or recession in the United States. If that occurs, demand for the transporting of products across the United States by trucks may decline, which may significantly adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
Many of the restrictions that had been imposed in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted and commercial activity in the United States generally has increasingly returned to pre-pandemic practices and operations. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant adverse impact on our overall business. 
Growth Strategies
We continue to prioritize and focus on key initiatives across our organization including top-line growth through high return capital investments, bottom-line growth through process improvement and cost discipline, continued introduction of efficient technology and systems and defining the future of on-highway mobility through a commitment to energy alternatives, all in support of our core mission to return every traveler to the road better than they came.
Acquiring high quality existing travel centers and viable truck services facilities are key aspects of our strategic network growth plan. Our active acquisition pipeline may enable us to add independent and franchised sites along active corridors to strengthen the geographic coverage of our network and expand our scope of products and services and customer segments through investments of capital and human resources in our truck service business, particularly our TA Truck Service® Emergency Roadside Assistance, TA Truck Service® Mobile Maintenance and TA Commercial Tire Network™ programs. Each of these programs, as further described below under the heading “Operations – TA Truck Service,” can service our traditional long haul trucking customers as well as other truck owner customers we historically have not served.
Our recent acquisition, franchising and development activities are summarized as follows:
Travel Centers. During 2022, we completed the acquisitions of certain assets of seven existing travel centers, including the assumed operation of two travel centers which we own but which were previously leased and franchised to former tenants/franchisees.  Since the beginning of 2020, we entered into franchise agreements covering 68 travel centers to be operated under our travel center brand names, with 30 new franchise agreements entered in 2022, reaching our annual target. Five began operations during 2020, two began operations during 2021, and three began operations during 2022, and we expect the remaining 58 to open by the second quarter of 2025.
Typical improvements we make at recently added or refreshed travel centers include adding truck repair facilities and nationally branded QSRs, paving parking lots, rebranding gasoline offerings, replacing outdated fuel dispensers, installing DEF dispensing systems, adding biodiesel blending, changing signage, installing point of sale and other IT systems and general building and cosmetic upgrades. The cost of capital improvements to recently purchased travel centers are often substantial and require a long period of time to plan, design, permit and complete; and, after being completed, the improved travel centers require a period of time to become part of our customers’ supply networks and produce stabilized financial results. Depending on the extent of the improvements we estimate that the travel centers we acquire generally will reach financial stabilization approximately one to three years after completion of improvements, but actual results can vary widely from this estimate due to many factors, some of which are outside our control, and we cannot be certain that acquired locations will operate profitably. For instance, the acquisition of an existing franchised travel center or site refresh could have a financial stabilization period of one year or less, whereas the new construction or significant overhaul of a newly-franchised or company-owned travel center could take up to three years to reach financial stabilization.
Truck Service Facilities. During 2022, we completed the acquisitions of two truck service facilities, and entered into a lease for another facility, which began operating as TA Truck Service® during the year.
See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information about recent acquisitions.
Our Travel Centers
Our typical TA or Petro branded travel center includes:
•over 24 acres of land with parking for approximately 200 tractor trailers and 100 cars;
•a FSR and one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;
•a truck repair facility and parts shop;
•multiple diesel and gasoline fueling points, including DEF dispensers at the diesel lanes; and
•a travel store, game room, lounge and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.
Our typical TA Express branded travel center includes:
•approximately 10 acres of land with parking for approximately 70 tractor trailers and 50 cars;
•one or more QSRs that we operate as a franchisee under various brands;
•multiple diesel, gasoline and DEF fueling points; and
•a travel store and other amenities for professional truck drivers and motorists.
Substantially all of our travel centers are full service sites located on or near an interstate highway exit and offer fuel and nonfuel products and services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.
Our travel center locations offer a broad range of products and services designed to appeal to our customers, including:
•Fuel. We sell unbranded diesel fuel at separate truck fueling lanes and we sell gasoline and diesel fuel at motorist fuel islands. As of December 31, 2022, we offered branded gasoline at approximately 259 of our locations and unbranded gasoline at nine of our travel centers operated by our franchisees and five of our travel centers operated by us.
•Diesel Exhaust Fluid. DEF is an additive that is required by most truck engines manufactured after 2010. As of December 31, 2022, we offered DEF from dispensers on the diesel fueling island at approximately 278 of our travel centers and plan to have DEF dispensers available in all lanes at our travel centers.
•FSRs and QSRs. Most of our TA and Petro branded travel centers have both FSRs and QSRs, and our TA Express branded travel centers have one or more QSRs that offer customers a wide variety of nationally recognized branded food choices. The substantial majority of our FSRs within our travel centers are operated under our Iron Skillet® and Country Pride® brands and offer menu table service. We recently added the Fork and Compass FSR to our brand portfolio, a new dining experience, at a Petro branded travel center. At certain travel centers we have converted the FSR to a franchised brand, such as IHOP®, Black Bear Diner®, Fuddruckers® and Bob Evans®. We are continuing to evaluate other opportunities to drive value within our FSRs, including the conversion of select FSRs to a fast casual concept, which includes The Kitchen, a new proprietary fast food offering currently located at select TA and Petro locations. We also operate approximately 62 different brands of QSRs, including Popeye’s Chicken & Biscuits®, Subway®, Burger King®, Taco Bell®, Pizza Hut®, Dunkin’® and Starbuck’s Coffee®. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 152 of our travel centers included a FSR, approximately 194 of our travel centers offered at least one QSR and there were a total of approximately 458 QSRs in our 281 travel centers.
•Truck Service. Most of our travel centers have truck repair and maintenance facilities. Our 259 truck repair and maintenance facilities typically have between three and six service bays and are staffed by trained service technicians employed by us or our franchisees. These shops generally operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and offer extensive maintenance and emergency repair and road services, ranging from basic services such as oil changes, wheel alignments and tire repair or replacement to specialty services such as diagnostics and repair of air conditioning, brakes and electrical systems. Our repair and maintenance services are generally covered by our nationwide warranty. In addition to work we perform at our facilities, we also provide roadside emergency truck and trailer repair, facilitated by our internal call center and off site Mobile Maintenance repair and maintenance services, as described under the heading “Operations – TA Truck Service” below.
•Travel Stores. Travel stores located in our travel centers have a broad merchandise selection of more than 25,000 items. The General Merchandise selection is designated to support the professional driver’s lifestyle while on the road. It includes the latest electronics, oil and additives, hardware and tools, clothing, and cab and bunk supplies. The Convenience offering includes cold beverages, candy, salty snacks, sweet treats, and traditional grocery items such as meal solutions, pet supplies, and health and beauty products. Each store has fresh food, pre-packaged meal solutions, snacks to grab, freshly brewed coffee, and cold fountain drinks. Each store has unique gifts for guests to buy for family or friends, whether it’s a holiday or moment to celebrate. Guests can also purchase regional souvenirs to remember their trip by.
•Parking. We have a total of approximately 74,000 parking spaces, of which 48,000 are tractor trailer parking spaces and 26,000 are car parking spaces. Many of our travel centers offer the Reserve-It!® parking program, which allows drivers to reserve for a fee a parking space in advance of arriving at a travel center. As of December 31, 2022, we offered the Reserve-It!® parking program at 266 of our travel centers and we had dedicated a total of approximately 7,600 parking spaces for this program. 
•Additional Driver Services. We believe that trucking fleets can improve the retention and recruitment of truck drivers by directing them to visit large, high quality, full service travel centers with plentiful overnight parking such as ours. We offer commercial trucker and other customer loyalty programs, the principal program being the UltraOne® Program, that are similar to frequent shopper programs offered by other retailers. Under our loyalty programs, drivers receive points for diesel fuel purchases and for selected nonfuel products and services. These points may be redeemed for discounts on nonfuel products and services at our travel centers. Some of our travel centers offer casino gaming. We strive to provide a consistently high level of service and amenities to professional truck drivers at all of our travel centers, which we believe make our travel centers an attractive choice for trucking fleets. Most of our travel centers provide truck drivers amenities including:
•specialized business services, including an information center where drivers can send and receive faxes, overnight mail and other communications;
•a banking desk where drivers can cash checks and receive funds transfers from fleet operators;
•wi-fi internet access;
•a laundry area with washers and dryers;
•private showers;
•free exercise facilities; 
•areas designated for truck drivers only, including a theater or big screen television room with a video player and comfortable seating; and
•ample parking including Reserve-It!® parking.
Operations
Fuel. We sell fuel to our customers at prices that we establish daily or are indexed to market prices and reset daily. For the year ended December 31, 2022, diesel fuel and gasoline revenues represented approximately 90.2% and 9.8%, respectively, of our total fuel revenues. We use discounting as a principal form of competition to grow our business with key customers and channels. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90.6% of our diesel fuel sales volume was sold at discounts to posted prices under pricing arrangements with fleet customers. We have numerous sources for our diesel fuel and gasoline supply, including nearly all of the large oil companies operating in the United States. We purchase diesel fuel from various suppliers at rates that fluctuate with market prices and generally are reset daily. By establishing diesel fuel supply relationships with several alternate suppliers for most locations, we believe we are able to effectively create competition for our purchases among various diesel fuel suppliers, and also to capitalize on favorable purchasing opportunities that are accretive to our fuel margin. We also believe that purchasing arrangements with multiple diesel fuel suppliers may help us avoid product shortages during times of diesel fuel supply disruptions. At some locations, however, there are few suppliers for diesel fuel in that market and we may have only one viable supplier. Generally we have single sources of supply for gasoline at each of our locations. We offer biodiesel at a number of our travel centers and have a limited number of suppliers for this product at those sites. We continually monitor our fuel purchasing, pricing, supply and inventory management and take actions we believe appropriate and intended to improve fuel margins.
A large majority of truck drivers use a payment method known as truck “fuel cards” that allow truck drivers to purchase fuel and other products and services, and permits trucking companies to track fuel and other purchases made by their drivers throughout the United States. Most of our trucking customers transact business with us by use of these fuel cards, most of which are issued by third party fuel card companies. Currently, the fuel card industry has only two significant participants, FleetCor Technologies, Inc., the parent of Comdata Inc., or Comdata, and its subsidiaries, or FleetCor, and WEX Inc., and its subsidiaries, or WEX. During 2022, we entered into an agreement with WEX and launched a new private label fuel card as a one card solution for diesel, DEF, gasoline, repairs, scales and other services. The card program is underwritten and managed by WEX and offers loyalty perks to cardholders for transactions at TA sites. We believe almost all trucking companies use only a single fuel card provider and have become increasingly dependent upon the data, reports and other services provided by their respective sole fuel card provider to manage their fleets and simplify their data processing.
Generally, our fuel purchases are delivered directly from suppliers’ terminals to our locations and we do not contract to purchase substantial quantities of fuel to hold as inventory; however, we may do so in the future. We generally have only a few days of diesel fuel and gasoline inventory at our travel centers. We believe our exposure to market price increases for diesel fuel and gasoline is partially mitigated by the significant amount of our diesel fuel and gasoline sales that are sold under arrangements that include pricing formulae that reset daily and are indexed to market prices and by us generally not purchasing fuel for delivery other than on the date of purchase. Additionally, there has historically been a significant correlation over time between the indices used in our sales contracts and those used in our purchasing contracts. Due to this correlation, we historically have not engaged in any fixed or hedged price fuel contracts.
Non-Fossil Fuel and Alternative Energy. In anticipation of the possible changes that may eventually affect our industry regarding fuel and energy use, we are evaluating our long term strategies to position ourselves to efficiently and successfully adapt to these changes. These industry changes may include increasing adoption of the use of non-fossil fuel and alternative energy. Among these changes may be the use of electric vehicle, or EV, technologies, which have been led initially by the automotive and light duty truck industries and more recently followed by leaders in commercial trucking, as well as hydrogen fuel, natural gas and other possible sources. While we are in the preliminary stages of evaluating these changes, we believe that a defined strategy, with dedicated internal resources, is important as we position ourselves to successfully incorporate these changes into our business. While we are currently increasing our biodiesel blending capabilities, as well as expanding our ability to offer DEF at the pump, we are also preparing for the future. This preparation includes dedicated internal leadership, agreements with EV charging equipment providers, as well as the potential for direct capital investments in EV infrastructure. We are actively participating with states in their EV infrastructure rollout to support the expected increase in electric vehicles on the road. In the medium and heavy duty truck space, we are preparing to offer hydrogen fuel and high speed EV charging at one of our sites. We recently announced a non-exclusive agreement with Eletrify America, provider of the largest open direct current fast-charging network in the United States, to expand electric vehicle fast-charging infrastructure at our sites nationwide. We continue to actively explore other opportunities regarding alternative fuels and energy.
Nonfuel Products. We have many sources for the large variety of nonfuel products that we sell. We have developed supply relationships with several suppliers of certain nonfuel products and maintain two distribution centers to distribute certain nonfuel products to our locations using a combination of contract carriers. We believe these distribution centers allow us to purchase, maintain and transport inventory and supplies at lower costs.
TA Truck Service. In addition to the truck repair and maintenance services provided at our travel centers, we also provide customers a wide variety of “off site” repair and maintenance services, as described below.
•TA Truck Service® Emergency Roadside Assistance is a roadside truck service program that operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week. As of December 31, 2022, this program included a fleet of approximately 630 heavy duty professionally maintained emergency vehicles equipped with GPS technology at our travel centers and other sites and third party roadside service providers in 49 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces with a total of approximately 15,000 locations. We centrally dispatch our service trucks and third party service providers from our call center to assist customers with comprehensive repair services when they are unable to bring their trucks to our travel centers due to a break down. 
•TA Truck Service® Mobile Maintenance offers truck and trailer mobile maintenance and repair services performed by certified technicians at customer facilities, with a fleet of approximately 356 trucks in service as of December 31, 2022. TA Truck Service Mobile Maintenance is designed to be a “bay on wheels” fully stocked with standard and specialty parts and state of the art technology that offers various services such as pre-trip truck inspections, U.S. Department of Transportation required inspections, tire repair and replacement, electric systems checks, brake inspections, used truck inspections and complete lubrication services.
•TA Commercial Tire Network™ is a commercial tire program we began in late 2016 through which we sell a variety of branded tires at our truck repair and maintenance facilities, on customers’ lots, distribution centers, through direct sales and under tire manufacturers’ national fleet account programs. The TA Commercial Tire Network™ includes a tire retread facility that is part of the Goodyear Authorized Retread Network, providing a full line of Goodyear commercial tire retread products to fleets, local industries and tire dealers within a 150 mile radius of its location in Bowling Green, Ohio. Many of our truck service facilities have access to the retread tires produced at this plant. We believe the TA Commercial Tire Network™ is the most comprehensive commercial tire purchasing, monitoring and maintenance program in the United States.
Competition
Fuel and nonfuel products and services can be obtained by trucking companies and truck drivers from a variety of sources, including national and regional full service travel centers and pumper only truck stops, some of which are owned or franchised by large chains and some of which are independently owned and operated, and some large service stations. In addition, some trucking companies operate their own terminals to provide fuel and services to their own trucking fleets and drivers. Some of our competitors may have more resources than we do and vertically integrated fuel and other businesses which may provide them competitive advantages. For all of these reasons and others, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
We believe that although the travel center and truck stop industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 6,500 travel centers and truck stops in the United States, the largest trucking fleets tend to purchase the majority of their fuel from us and our two largest competitors. Based on the number of locations, Pilot Travel Centers LLC (which includes the Flying J brand), or Pilot, Love’s Travel Stops and Country Stores, or Love’s, and TA are the three largest companies focused principally on the travel center industry. We believe that in recent years, both of our principal competitors, Pilot and Love’s, added more travel centers to their networks than we added to our network, and in some cases, competition from new sites added by Pilot and Love’s may have impacted our results. Nevertheless, we believe we are able to compete successfully in part because many of our travel centers were originally developed years ago when prime real estate locations along the U.S. interstate highway system were more readily available than they are today, which we believe would make it difficult to fully replicate our travel center business, and also in part because of our full service offerings and larger locations that are not often replicated by our principal competitors. We compete with other travel center and truck stop chains based primarily on diesel fuel prices and the quality, variety and pricing of our nonfuel products, services and amenities. 
Our truck repair and maintenance facilities compete with other providers of truck repair and maintenance facilities, including some at Pilot and Love's locations. For truck maintenance and repair services, we also compete with regional full service travel center and smaller truck stop chains, full service independently owned and operated travel centers and truck stops, fleet maintenance terminals, independent garages, truck and commercial tire dealerships, truck quick lube facilities and other parts and service centers. We also compete with other FSRs, QSRs, mass merchandisers, electronics stores, drugstores, gasoline stations and convenience stores. Some truck fleets own their own fuel and repair and maintenance facilities; however, we believe the long term trend has been toward a reduction in these facilities in favor of obtaining fuel and repair and maintenance services from third parties like us. We believe that we are able to compete successfully because we offer consistent, high quality products and services, and our nationwide travel centers provide an advantage to large trucking fleets, particularly long haul trucking fleets, by enabling them to (i) take advantage of efficiencies afforded by the wide array of products and services our travel centers provide for their equipment and their drivers and (ii) reduce the number of their suppliers by routing their trucks through our broad nationwide footprint of travel centers.
An additional source of competition in the future could result from commercialization of state owned interstate highway rest areas. Some state governments have historically requested that the federal government allow these rest areas to offer fuel and nonfuel products and services similar to that offered at a travel center and certain congressional leaders have historically supported such legislation. If commercialized, these rest areas may increase the number of locations competing with us and these rest areas may have significant competitive advantages over existing travel centers, including ours, because they are generally located on restricted (i.e., toll) roads and have dedicated ingress and egress. 
Our Leases with SVC
We have five leases with SVC, four of which we refer to as the TA Leases and one of which we refer to as the Petro Lease, and which we refer to collectively as the SVC Leases.
SVC Leases. Pursuant to the SVC Leases, we lease 144 properties under the TA Leases and 35 properties under the Petro Lease. One of our subsidiaries is the tenant under the leases, and we guarantee the tenant’s obligations under the leases.
Term. The TA Leases expire on December 31, 2029, 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Petro Lease expires on June 30, 2035. We may extend each of these leases for up to two additional periods of 15 years.
Annual Minimum Rent. As of December 31, 2022, our aggregate annual minimum rent payable to SVC under the SVC Leases was $243.9 million. We may request that SVC purchase approved renovations, improvements and equipment additions we make at the leased properties, in return for an increase in our annual minimum rent equal to the amount paid by SVC multiplied by the greater of (i) 8.5% or (ii) a benchmark U.S. Treasury interest rate plus 3.5%. SVC is not required to purchase 
any improvements and we are not required to sell any improvements to SVC. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not sell to SVC any improvements we made to properties leased from SVC.
Percentage Rent. Under the SVC Leases, we incur percentage rent payable to SVC. The percentage rent is 3.5% of the excess of nonfuel revenues for any particular year over the percentage rent base year amount.
Deferred Rent. Under the SVC Leases, we owed deferred rent to SVC in an aggregate amount of $70.5 million, which became payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2019. The total amount of deferred rent outstanding as of December 31, 2022, was $4.4 million. This amount was fully paid in January 2023. 
In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, we agreed with BP and SVC to amend and restate our subsidiary’s leases with certain of SVC's subsidiaries and corresponding guaranty agreements, in each case effective at the Effective Time, conditioned on the occurrence of the closing of the Merger. 
For more information about other terms of the SVC Leases, please refer to Part I, Item 1 “Business – Our Leases with SVC” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.
Relationships with Franchisees
We have franchise agreements with owners of travel centers. We collect franchise, royalty, advertising and other fees under these agreements. The table below summarizes by state information as of December 31, 2022, regarding branding and ownership of the travel centers our franchisees operate and excludes travel centers we operate. Information about the locations we operate is included in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report.

TA, TA Express and Petro Franchise Agreements 
The following is a summary of the material provisions typically included in our TA, TA Express and Petro travel centers franchise agreements. 
Initial Franchise Fee. Franchisees pay an initial franchise fee for a new TA, TA Express or Petro franchise, with reduced fees for multiple sites. 
Term of Agreement. The initial term of a franchise agreement is generally 10 years. Our TA, TA Express and Petro franchise agreements generally provide for two five-year renewals on the terms then being offered to prospective franchisees at the time of the franchise renewal.
Protected Territory. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for TA and TA Express travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the TA or TA Express brand in a specified territory for that TA or TA Express branded franchised travel center. Under the terms of our franchise agreements for Petro travel centers, generally we have agreed not to operate, or allow another person to operate, a travel center or travel center business that uses the Petro brand in a specified territory for that Petro branded franchised travel center.
Restrictive Covenants. Generally our franchisees may not operate any travel center or truck stop related business under a franchise agreement, licensing agreement or marketing plan or system of another person or entity. If the franchisee owns the franchised premises, generally for a two year period after expiration or earlier termination of our franchise agreement the franchisee may not operate the premises under a competitive brand.
Nonfuel Product Offerings. Franchisees are required to operate their travel centers in conformity with guidelines that we establish and offer any products and services that we deem to be a standard product or service in our travel centers.
Fuel Purchases and Royalties. Our franchise agreements require the franchisee to pay us a royalty fee per gallon of fuel sold based on sales of certain fuels at the franchised travel center. We also purchase receivables generated by some of our franchisees in connection with sales to common trucking fleet customers through our proprietary billing system on a non-recourse basis in return for a fee.
Royalty Payments on Nonfuel Revenues. Franchisees are required to pay us a royalty fee based on a percentage of nonfuel revenues, including on revenues from branded QSRs, in some cases up to a threshold amount, with a lower percentage fee payable on amounts in excess of the threshold amount.
Advertising, Promotion and Image Enhancement. Our franchisees are required to make additional payments to us as contributions to the applicable brand wide advertising, marketing and promotional expenses we incur.
Termination/Nonrenewal. Generally, we may terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement for default by the franchisee. Generally, we may also refuse to renew if we determine that renewal would not be in our economic interest or if the franchisee will not agree to the terms in our then current form of applicable franchise agreement.
Rights of First Refusal. During the term of each franchise agreement, we generally have a right of first refusal to purchase the franchised travel center at the price the franchisee is willing to accept from a third party. In addition, some of our franchise agreements give us a right to purchase the franchised travel center for fair market value, as determined by the parties or an independent appraiser, upon expiration or earlier termination of the franchise agreement.
Regulatory Environment
Environmental Regulation
Extensive environmental laws regulate our operations and properties. These laws may require us to investigate and clean up hazardous substances, including petroleum or natural gas products, released at our owned and leased properties. Governmental entities or third parties may hold us liable for property damage and personal injuries, and for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs incurred in connection with any contamination and regulatory compliance at our locations. We use both underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks to store petroleum products, natural gas and other hazardous substances at our locations. We must comply with environmental laws regarding tank construction, integrity testing, leak detection and monitoring, overfill and spill control, release reporting and financial assurance for corrective action in the event of a release. Investigation and remediation of both surface spills and subsurface releases is handled by contracted third party consultants and managed by our environmental staff. At some locations we must also comply with environmental laws relative to vapor recovery or discharges to water. Under the terms of the SVC Leases, we generally have agreed to indemnify SVC for any environmental liabilities related to properties that we lease from SVC and we are required to pay all environmental related expenses incurred in the operation of the leased properties. We have entered into certain other arrangements in which we have agreed to indemnify third parties for environmental liabilities and expenses resulting from our operations.

For further information about these and other environmental and climate change matters, see the disclosure under the heading “Environmental Contingencies” in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report. In addition, for more information about these environmental and weather events and climate change matters and about the risks which may arise as a result, see elsewhere in this Annual Report, including “Warning Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” Item 1A “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Environmental and Climate Change Matters.”
Franchise Regulation
Subject to certain exemptions, the Federal Trade Commission regulations require that we make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees and some states require state registration and delivery of specified disclosure documentation to potential franchisees. Some state laws also impose restrictions on our ability to terminate or not renew franchises and impose other limitations on the terms of our franchise relationships or the conduct of our franchise business. The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act imposes special regulations on franchises where petroleum products are offered for sale. Also, a number of states include, within the scope of their petroleum franchising statutes, prohibitions against price discrimination and other allegedly anticompetitive conduct. These provisions supplement applicable federal and state antitrust laws. We believe that we are in compliance with all franchise laws applicable to our business.
Gaming Regulation
Because we have gaming operations at some of our travel centers, we and our concerned subsidiaries are currently subject to gaming regulations in Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Requirements under gaming regulations vary by jurisdiction but include, among other things:
•findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to, or licensure of, certain of our and our licensed subsidiaries’ directors, officers and key employees and certain individuals having a material relationship with us or our licensed subsidiaries;
•findings of suitability by the relevant gaming authorities with respect to certain of our security holders and restrictions on ownership of certain of our securities;
•prior approval in certain circumstances by the relevant gaming authorities of offerings of our securities;
•prior approval by the relevant gaming authorities of changes in control of us; and
•specified reporting requirements.
Holders of beneficial interests of our voting securities are subject to licensing or suitability investigations by the relevant gaming authorities under various circumstances including, generally, service on our Board of Directors, the attainment of certain levels of ownership of a class of our voting securities, or involvement in the gaming operations of or influence over us or our licensed subsidiaries. Persons or entities seeking to acquire control of us or our operation of the license are subject to prior investigation by and approval from the relevant gaming authorities. Any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required by a relevant gaming authority to file an application and have their suitability reviewed in certain circumstances, including if the gaming authority has reason to believe that such ownership of our voting securities would otherwise be inconsistent with its state’s gaming laws. In some jurisdictions, the applicant must pay all costs of investigations incurred in connection with such investigations. Additionally, in the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a person or entity is unsuitable to be an owner of our securities, such person would be prohibited from, among other things, receiving any dividend or interest upon such securities, exercising any voting right conferred through such securities or continuing to hold our securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by such gaming authority, managing the licensed business and, in some cases, the stockholders may be required to divest themselves of our voting securities.
Certain of our and our subsidiaries’ directors and officers must also file applications, be investigated and be licensed or found suitable by the relevant gaming authorities in order to hold such positions. In the event of a finding by a relevant gaming authority that a director, officer, key employee or individual with whom we or our licensed subsidiary have a material relationship is unsuitable, we or our licensed subsidiary, as applicable, may be required to sever our relationships with such individual or such individual may be prohibited from serving as our director or officer.
Any violations by us or any of our licensed subsidiaries of the gaming regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, penalties (including the limiting, conditioning, suspension or revocation of any licenses held) and criminal actions. Additionally, certain jurisdictions, such as Nevada, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports regarding those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
We have a Gaming Compliance Plan, or the Compliance Plan, as required by the Nevada Gaming Commission in connection with our gaming operations at certain of our travel center locations. In connection with the Compliance Plan, we have a Gaming Compliance Committee, or the Compliance Committee, on which a member of our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors serves as the Board of Directors’ liaison to the Compliance Committee pursuant to the terms of the Compliance Plan. The Compliance Committee assists us in monitoring activities relating to our continuing qualifications under applicable gaming laws.
Seasonality
Our sales volumes are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters than the second and third quarters of each year. In the first quarter, the movement of freight by professional truck drivers as well as motorist travel are usually at their lowest levels of the calendar year. In the fourth quarter, freight movement is typically lower due to the holiday season. While our revenues are modestly seasonal, quarterly variations in our operating results may reflect greater seasonal differences as our rent expense and certain other costs do not vary seasonally. 
Human Capital Resources
Our core mission is to “Return every traveler to the road better than they came.” Our five values, Welcoming, Empathetic, Integrity, Openness and Team Player, define the behaviors we expect from our employees. We have a longstanding history of supporting the professional truck drivers who keep the U.S. economy moving and those who have served our country, including both retired and active-duty military. We are committed to supporting the local communities we serve.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 18,500 employees with 5.1% employed at our corporate headquarters and 94.9% across 243 locations throughout the United States. Approximately 81.1% of our field employees were classified as full-time employees and the average tenure of our employees was three years. We are an equal opportunity employer, with all qualified applicants receiving consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, marital status, ancestry, sex, gender, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, handicap, military service or veteran status, genetic information or membership in any other category protected by applicable federal, state or local law. Diversity and inclusion are an important part of our hiring, retention and development programs. As of December 31, 2022, 45.1% and 37.9% of our employees were female and non-white, respectively, and 43.0% and 29.0% of our Board of Directors were female and non-white, respectively.
Our employee engagement, immersion and training initiatives center around our Mission Vision & Values. Our recruiting, on-boarding and retention programs and development of on-going training programs currently include the following:
•National Training Center. We maintain a national training center in Lodi, Ohio where we host educational programs to develop employees by teaching new skills and relevant technological changes.
•Manager in Training Program. This training program assists non-management and new management employees in learning the skills and experience to help enable them to advance their career and benefit our business and operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 306 field employees were promoted from non-manager to management level positions.
•Healthy Journeys Wellness Plan. We value the health and well-being of all our employees. For this reason, we offer the Healthy Journeys Wellness Program to help eligible employees and their spouses manage their health while controlling their family’s healthcare costs. The program includes many resources to support wellness, including online health courses and a smoking cessation program.
•Educational Assistance Plan. Eligible employees can participate in TA’s Educational Assistance Plan for tuition reimbursement. We pay up to 75.0% of the cost of tuition and certain fees for any approved course taken by a regular full-time employee at an accredited high school, university or college, trade, business or correspondence school. Eligible truck service technicians who graduated from a certified technical school and have education related loan repayment obligations can also earn funds to repay their loan.
