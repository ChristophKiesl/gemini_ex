Item 1. Business
 
The discussion of our business is as of the date of filing this report, unless otherwise indicated.
 
Overview
 
QS Energy, Inc. (“QS Energy” or “Company” or “we” or “us” or “our”) develops and commercializes energy efficiency technologies that assist in meeting increasing global energy demands, improving the economics of oil extraction and transport, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Company's intellectual properties include a portfolio of domestic and international patents and patents pending, a substantial portion of which have been developed in conjunction with and exclusively licensed from Temple University of Philadelphia, PA (“Temple”). QS Energy's primary technology is called Applied Oil Technology™ (AOT), a commercial-grade crude oil pipeline transportation flow-assurance product. Engineered specifically to reduce pipeline pressure loss, increase pipeline flow rate and capacity, and reduce shippers’ reliance on diluents and drag reducing agents to meet pipeline maximum viscosity requirements, AOT is a 100% solid-state system that reduces crude oil viscosity by applying a high intensity electrical field to crude oil feedstock while in transit. AOT technology delivers reductions in crude oil viscosity and pipeline pressure loss as demonstrated in independent third-party tests performed by the U.S. Department of Energy, the PetroChina Pipeline R&D Center, and ATS RheoSystems, a division of CANNON™, at full-scale test facilities in the U.S. and China, and under commercial operating conditions on one of North America’s largest high-volume crude oil pipelines. Recent testing on a commercial crude oil condensate pipeline demonstrated high correlation between laboratory analysis and full-scale AOT operations under commercial operating conditions with onsite measurements and data collected by the pipeline operator on its supervisory control and data acquisition (“SCADA”) system. The AOT product has transitioned from laboratory testing and ongoing research and development to initial production and continued testing in advance of our goal of seeking acceptance and adoption by the midstream pipeline marketplace. We continue to devote the bulk of our efforts to the promotion, design, testing and the commercial manufacturing and operations of our crude oil pipeline products in the upstream and midstream energy sector. We anticipate that these efforts will continue during 2017 and 2018.
 
Our Company was incorporated on February 18, 1998, as a Nevada Corporation under the name Mandalay Capital Corporation. The Company changed its name to Save the World Air, Inc. on February 11, 1999. Effective August 11, 2015, the Company changed its name to QS Energy, Inc. The name change was effected through a short-form merger pursuant to Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Additionally, QS Energy Pool, Inc., a California corporation, was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on July 6, 2015 to serve as a vehicle for the Company to explore, review and consider acquisition opportunities. The Company’s common stock is quoted under the symbol “QSEP” on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. More information including the Company’s fact sheet, logos and media articles are available at our corporate website, www.qsenergy.com.
 
Between 2011 and 2012, the Company transitioned from prototype testing of its AOT technology at the U.S. Department of Energy Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center, Midwest, Wyoming (“RMOTC”), to the design and production of full-scale commercial prototype units. The Company worked in a collaborative engineering environment with multiple energy industry companies to refine the AOT Midstream commercial design to comply with the stringent standards and qualification processes as dictated by independent engineering audit groups and North American industry regulatory bodies. In May 2013, the Company’s first commercial prototype unit known as AOT Midstream, was completed.
 
In 2013, the Company entered into an Equipment Lease/Option to Purchase Agreement (“TransCanada Lease”) with TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. by its agent TC Oil Pipeline Operations, Inc. ("TransCanada") which agreed to lease and test the effectiveness of the Company’s AOT technology and equipment on one of TransCanada’s operating pipelines. As previously reported in our 10-K report filed with the SEC on March 16, 2015, in June 2014, the equipment was accepted by TransCanada and the lease commenced and the first full test of the AOT equipment on the Keystone pipeline was performed in July 2014 by Dr. Rongjia Tao of Temple University, with subsequent testing performed by an independent laboratory, ATS RheoSystems, a division of CANNON™ (“ATS”) in September 2014. Upon review of the July 2014 test results and preliminary report by Dr. Tao, QS Energy and TransCanada mutually agreed that this initial test was flawed due to, among other factors, the short-term nature of the test, the inability to isolate certain independent pipeline operating factors such as fluctuations in upstream pump station pressures, and limitations of the AOT device to produce a sufficient electric field to optimize viscosity reduction. Subsequent testing by ATS in September 2014 demonstrated viscosity reductions of 8% to 23% depending on flow rates and crude oil types in transit. In its summary report, ATS concluded that i) data indicated a decrease in viscosity of crude oil flowing through the TransCanada pipeline due to AOT treatment of the crude oil; and ii) the power supply installed on our equipment would need to be increased to maximize reduction in viscosity and take full advantage of the AOT technology. While more testing is required to establish the commercial efficacy of our AOT technology, we are encouraged by the findings of these field tests performed under commercial operating conditions. The TransCanada Lease was terminated by TransCanada, effective October 15, 2014. Upon termination of the TransCanada Lease, all equipment was uninstalled, returned, inspected and configured for re-deployment.

On July 15, 2014, the Company entered into an Equipment Lease/Option to Purchase Agreement (“Kinder Morgan Lease”) with Kinder Morgan Crude & Condensate, LLC (“Kinder Morgan”) under which Kinder Morgan agreed to lease and test the effectiveness of the Company’s AOT technology and equipment on one of Kinder Morgan’s operating pipelines. Equipment provided under the Lease includes a single AOT Midstream pressure vessel with a maximum flow capacity of 5,000 gallons per minute. The equipment was delivered to Kinder Morgan in December 2014 and installed in March 2015. In April 2015, during pre-start testing, low electrical impedance was measured in the unit, indicating an electrical short. A replacement unit was installed May 2015. The second unit also presented with low impedance when flooded with crude condensate from Kinder Morgan’s pipeline. Subsequent to design modifications, a remanufactured AOT unit was installed and tested at Kinder Morgan’s pipeline facility in in August 2015. Initial results were promising, with the unit operating generally as expected. However, voltage dropped as preliminary tests continued, indicating decreased impedance within the AOT pressure vessel. QS Energy personnel and outside consultants performed a series of troubleshooting assessments and determined that, despite modifications made to the AOT, conductive materials present in the crude oil condensate continued to be the root cause of the decreased impedance. Based on these results, QS Energy and Kinder Morgan personnel mutually agreed to hold on final acceptance of equipment under the lease and temporarily suspend in-field testing to provide time to re-test crude oil condensate in a laboratory setting, and thoroughly review and test selected AOT component design and fabrication. Subsequent analysis and testing led to changes in electrical insulation, inlet flow improvements and other component modifications. These design changes were implemented and tested by Industrial Screen and Maintenance (ISM), one of QS Energy's supply chain partners in Casper, Wyoming. Test performed by ISM at its Wyoming facility indicated significant improvements to system impedance and efficiency of electric field generation.
 
In February 2016, the modified AOT equipment was installed at Kinder Morgan’s facility. Pre-acceptance testing was performed in April 2016, culminating in more than 24 hours of continuous operations. In-field viscosity measurements and pipeline data collected during this test indicated the AOT equipment operated as expected, resulting in viscosity reductions equivalent to those measured under laboratory conditions. Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (“SCADA”) pipeline operating data collected by Kinder Morgan during this test indicated a pipeline pressure drop reduction consistent with expectations. Kinder Morgan provided the Company with a number of additional crude oil samples which were tested in the laboratory for future test correlation and operational planning purposes. Based on final analysis of in field test results, SCADA operating data and subsequent analysis of crude oil samples at Temple University, Kinder Morgan and QS Energy are considering moving the AOT test facility to a different, higher-volume pipeline location.
 
Southern Research Institute (SRI) was engaged by QS Energy in 2015 to investigate the root cause of the crude oil condensate impedance issue by replicating conditions experienced in the field utilizing a laboratory-scaled version of the AOT and crude oil condensate samples provided by Kinder Morgan. In addition, QS Energy retained an industry expert petroleum pipeline engineer to review the AOT design and suggest design modifications to resolve the crude oil condensate impedance issue. This engineer has studied design details, staff reports and forensic photographs of each relevant AOT installation and test. Based on these investigations, specific modifications were proposed to resolve the impedance issue, and improve the overall efficiency of the AOT device, resulting in a new value-engineered design of certain AOT internal components.
 
The Company is actively seeking new deployments of its AOT technology. In August, 2015, QS Energy was invited to an offshore oil transfer platform in the Gulf of Mexico. This offshore platform was assessed by QS Energy personnel for a potential deployment of the AOT viscosity reduction technology as a solution for super-heavy crude oil flow assurance issues. Following the site visit, subject to non-disclosure agreements executed by all parties, laboratory testing was performed on crude oil samples provided by the operator, which demonstrated significant AOT viscosity reductions. Detailed hydraulic analysis based on laboratory results and pipeline operating parameters was presented to the operator demonstrating potential benefits of AOT technology within the operator’s specified infrastructure. Based on this analysis, the Company was directed by the operator to prepare a preliminary configuration for AOT units optimized for the operator’s high-volume, space-constrained operations. Company engineers and supply chain partners have prepared an optimized configuration and production budget. Based on this optimized configuration, the operator is considering an onsite pilot test with full scale AOT equipment for deployment in 2018 or 2019.
 
The Company is in discussions with a large Middle Eastern oil company regarding AOT technology in Middle East, having tested multiple oil samples provided by this oil company at Temple University in 2015 and 2016. The most recent round of testing on Middle Eastern oil company samples was completed early 2017, demonstrating AOT viscosity reductions of 20% to 50% in a laboratory setting.

During the third quarter 2016, the Company developed a new onsite testing program designed to accelerate the AOT sales cycle. This program utilizes a fully functional laboratory-scale AOT device designed and developed by the Company in 2015, and tested at the Southern Research Institute. Under this new program, Company engineers will set up a temporary lab at the customer’s site to test a full range of crude oils. Fees charged for providing this service will be dependent on scope of services, crude oil sample to be tested, and onsite time requirements. This program has received a positive response from potential customers. In the fourth quarter 2016, the Company entered a contract to provide these onsite testing services to a Canadian oil producer and pipeline operator over a one-week period in early 2017 at a fixed price of $50,000. This initial test was performed in January 2017; data analysis and final report is expected to be completed in April 2017.
 
In 2014, the Company began development of a new suite of products based around the new electrical heat system which reduces oil viscosity through a process known as joule heat (“Joule Heat”). The Company is designing and optimizing the Joule Heat technology for the upstream oil transportation market. The Company filed two provisional patents related to the technology’s method and apparatus in the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. The first of the two provisional patents was finalized and submitted to non-provisional status on April 29, 2014. The second of the two provisional patents was finalized and submitted to non-provisional status at the end of the third quarter 2014.
 
In October 2014, QS Energy entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Newfield Exploration Company (“Newfield”) to test a prototype of QS Energy Joule Heat equipment, and combined Joule Heat and AOT technology, on a crude oil pipeline serving the Greater Monument Butte oilfield located in the Uintah Basin of Utah. This test of the Joule Heat technology provides ideal conditions to demonstrate efficiency and efficacy. The Uintah Basin is 5,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level with average low winter temperatures of 16ºF. Crude oil pumped from the region is highly paraffinic with the consistency of shoe polish at room temperature. Uintah's black wax crude must remain at a minimum of 95ºF and yellow wax above 115ºF and therefore requires a substantial amount of heat to keep it above its high pour point. Operators in the upstream market often run at temperatures of 140ºF to 160ºF. Newfield, like many other companies in the region, incurs significant operating expense in the form of fuel and power used to heat the waxy crude and counter the cold climate conditions characteristic of Utah. The Company’s first Joule Heat prototype was installed for testing purposes at the Newfield facility in June 2015 and the system is operational; however, changes to the prototype configuration will be required to determine commercial effectiveness of this unit. During the third and fourth quarters of 2015, we worked with Newfield and Dr. Carl Meinhart to modify the prototype configuration based on observed pipeline and Joule Heat operating factors. In addition, QS Energy provided a scaled-down version of the Joule Heat unit for static and flow-through testing at SRI. Testing performed by SRI in September 2015 on a laboratory-scale Joule Heat unit demonstrated the ability of the Joule Heat technology to deliver temperature increases in the laboratory setting.
 
In 2015, the Company worked in collaboration with Newfield, SRI, Dr. Carl Meinhart, and our manufacturing partner to design and build an AOT prototype unit, for operations in the upstream crude oil pipeline market (“AOT Upstream”), specifically configured for pipeline operating factors observed at Newfield’s Utah site. Our original plan was to retrofit an earlier prototype device previously tested at RMOTC; however, after multiple site visits and discussions with Newfield, it was determined a new, smaller unit, specifically optimized for Newfield operations would be more appropriate for this field test opportunity. We plan to jointly test the AOT Upstream prototype unit under typical upstream commercial pipeline conditions on Newfield’s pipeline in conjunction with the previously installed Joule Heat unit.
 
In December 2015, we temporarily suspended Joule Heat and AOT Upstream development activities to focus Company resources on finalizing commercial development of the AOT Midstream. Testing terminated at SRI and all prototype equipment was returned to the Company. We currently plan to resume Joule Heat and AOT Upstream development in 2017 depending on the availability of sufficient capital and other resources.
 
In July 2015, the Company formed QS Energy Pool, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of QS Energy, Inc., for the sole purpose of taking advantage of asset acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas operations market. QS Energy Pool is specifically targeting the acquisition of one or more operating companies or properties with proven positive cash flow, providing operating income and bottom line revenue which are both accretive to and synergistic with QS Energy, Inc.’s current operations. QS Energy has identified multiple attractive opportunities to acquire producing oil and gas field operations. Our strategy is to acquire producing oil and gas fields with production profiles of at least ten years, proven long-term development rights, and demonstrated positive cash flow at commodity prices as low as $25/barrel of oil and $2.00/MCF of gas. Any such acquisitions would be subject on our ability to obtain acquisition financing under acceptable terms and conditions. To date, we have not acquired any oil and gas properties, and there can be no assurances that we will do so in the future. We can provide no assurances that acquisition financing would be available to us.

Our expenses to date have been funded primarily through the sale of shares of common stock and convertible debt, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock purchase warrants and options. We will need to raise substantial additional capital through 2017, and beyond, to fund our sales and marketing efforts, continuing research and development, and certain other expenses, until our revenue base grows sufficiently.
 
There are significant risks associated with our business, our Company and our stock. See “Risk Factors,” below.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
QS Energy intends to continue commercialization and marketing of its current technologies. Our current and primary product portfolio is dedicated to the crude oil production and transportation marketplace, with a specifically-targeted product offering for enhancing the flow-assurance parameters of new and existing pipeline gathering and transmission systems.
 
Our primary goal is to provide the oil industry with a cost-effective method by which to increase the number of barrels of oil able to be transported per day through the industry’s existing and newly built pipelines. We also seek to provide the oil industry with a way to reduce emissions from operating equipment. We believe our goals are realizable via viscosity reduction using our AOT and Joule Heat product lines.
 
We believe QS Energy’s technologies will enable the petroleum industry to gain key value advantages boosting profit, while satisfying the needs of regulatory bodies at the same time. In 2014, we installed and operated AOT equipment on one of TransCanada’s North American pipeline, proving our ability to build, deliver and operate our AOT equipment on a high-volume commercial pipeline and key players in the pipeline industry continue to demonstrate strong interest in our technologies.
 
Our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third-party vendors and suppliers, each with a strong reputation and proven track record in the pipeline industry. These vendors are broken up by product component subcategory, enabling multiple manufacturing capacity redundancies and safeguards to be utilized. In addition, this strategy allows the Company to eliminate the prohibitively high capital expenditures such as costs of building, operating and maintaining its own manufacturing facilities, ratings, personnel and licenses, thereby eliminating unnecessary capital intensity and risk. 
 
Our identified market strategy is to continue meeting with oil and gas industry executives in the upstream, gathering, and midstream sectors from both domestic and foreign companies. Our goal is to introduce our technology to oil and gas companies and to demonstrate potential value for the purposes of negotiating commercial implementation of our AOT technology to their existing infrastructures.

Market Analysis Overview
 
The energy sector continues to operate in a period of both rapid change and expansion. Due to the relatively recent and widespread adoption of advanced oilfield drilling and completion technologies, known as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, enormous reserves of “tight” oil and gas are now recoverable from shale formations throughout North America and the world. This historic surge in upstream crude oil production has resulted in costly and persistent transportation bottlenecks when moving upstream production to downstream storage, offloading facilities and refineries. This persistent and severe industrywide problem is stimulating investments in new and existing pipeline infrastructure and a reliance on less desirable alternate forms of transport, including rail and freight truck.
 
Since the initial use of EOR or tertiary recovery techniques in the 1970s, oil and gas producers have progressively relied more heavily on the application of gas and chemical injection as well as thermal recovery. These extraction techniques, coupled with a much greater number of new wells in active oilfields, has raised the output of reservoirs by 30 to 60 percent above traditional primary and secondary recovery practices. Due to the rapid adoption of advanced extraction technologies throughout the U.S. energy industry, a 34-year decline in domestic oil and gas production was reversed in 2006. Historically high output from massive shale formations such as North Dakota’s Bakken, Texas’ Eagle Ford and Permian Basin, Colorado’s Green River and Utah’s Uintah Basin continues to the present day.
 
Other nations with significant exploitable shale formations include Russia, China, Argentina, Libya, Australia, Venezuela, Mexico and dozens of others, providing a ready market for crude oil pipeline optimization technologies as production comes online. All told, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates there to be 345 billion barrels of identified and recoverable shale oil worldwide.
 
Consequently, oil production greatly exceeds the capacity of existing pipelines in the U.S., Canada and many other regions of the world, often resulting in delivery delays to refineries, as well as reliance on less desirable rail and tanker truck transport.
 
Recently, the softening of oil prices worldwide has incentivized producers and transporters to reduce costs and seek technologies that can provide greater operational efficiencies. AOT and Joule Heat technologies are specifically designed to increase pipeline capacity, while reducing pipeline operating costs and overhead, thereby increasing margins and delivering measurable competitive advantages.

Projected Pipeline Infrastructure Investment
 
Among the challenges facing the global crude oil production and transportation sectors, few are as intransigent or detrimental to the industry as the transportation bottlenecks and well-to-market delivery delays that are endemic here in North America and overseas. While new pipeline infrastructure projects are underway here in the U.S., Canada and in foreign markets, gaining legislative approval is a lengthy process and their construction is highly capital-intensive.
 
Although pipelines are by far the safest and most economical transportation method, outmoded pipeline infrastructure constructed primarily in the 1950s and 1960s cannot provide the capacity necessary to move production downstream to storage, refinery and offloading facilities. Consequently, delivery delays to refineries and reliance on less desirable rail and tanker truck transport have increased exponentially since 2008 when the shale boom began in earnest. Data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, IHS Global and the American Petroleum Institute identify billions in lost revenue opportunities for E&P companies and tax collection agencies in leading oil producing states such as Texas, North Dakota, Alaska, California, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah directly attributable to production takeaway constraints.
 
As of 2013, the U.S. and Canadian midstream oil market was serviced by a total of 60,911 miles of crude oil pipelines, up 3,448 miles or 6 percent over 2012 and up 11,647 miles or 23 percent over the past decade. Planned midstream pipeline projects are expected to bring an additional 20,000 miles of pipeline capacity over the 5 to 10 years. However, the bulk of the active pipelines in the U.S. were constructed several decades ago, necessitating enormous capital investments to maintain and update the aging pipeline infrastructure. Studies by research firm IHS Global Inc. estimate that between 2014 and 2020, an average of greater than $80 billion will be invested annually in U.S. midstream and downstream petroleum infrastructure.
 
Despite the recently depressed price level of global oil benchmarks, experts forecast continued growth in crude oil pipeline capital expenditures. For example, a study published by GlobalData in February of this year, ‘North America and Russia to Dominate Global Oil and Gas Pipeline Construction by 2018’, estimates that U.S. oil and gas pipeline capital expenditures for new construction will exceed $500 billion, resulting in the construction of 24,000 miles of new oil and gas pipeline capacity.
 
QS Energy’s AOT and Joule Heat Technologies are strategically aligned with the major requirements and challenges facing the petroleum pipeline economy.
 
First, AOT allows the midstream sector to increase capacity while remaining within maximum pressure requirements. The technology can increase capacity for the industry and reduce reliance on truck and train transport, which has often proven inefficient and environmentally hazardous. Second, AOT and Joule Heat help to reduce operating expenses for pipeline operators. These technologies optimize pipeline operating efficiency, which is especially important given the current oil price environment.
 
Recently, the softening of oil prices worldwide has incentivized producers and transporters to reduce costs and seek technologies that can provide greater operational efficiencies. As noted by industry analysts, the drive to squeeze out better margins began in late 2013 when oil prices fell to the $100 per barrel mark after a price expansion cycle that had been in place since 2000 (“Deloitte: Low Oil Prices Creating Need for More Efficient Operations”, Rigzone.com, February 5, 2015). Capital-intensive extraction techniques necessary for unlocking tight oil and gas have boosted costs across the industry since the shale boom began in earnest in 2008, and today’s low spot prices have caused for upstream and midstream operators to aggressively reduce overhead.
 
In answer to the energy industry’s pressing challenges, QS Energy is commercializing cost-efficient solutions for increasing the capacity of existing and new pipeline gathering and transmission systems, capable of reducing operational overhead, increasing margins and delivering measurable competitive advantages.
 
Target Markets
 
The oil and gas sector market can be segmented into three primary categories: Upstream Producers, Midstream Transporters and Downstream Refiners:
 

· | The Upstream segment is involved in the exploration and production (E&P) of oil and gas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Midstream companies and partnerships transport oil and gas to markets via pipelines, rail and shipping, and provide storage in the field and at the destination location.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Downstream sector refines oil and gas into finished products and, in cooperation with manufacturers and retailers, markets and distributes fuels and other refined petroleum products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upstream Producers
 
The Upstream segment has the greatest exposure to commodity prices. When prices fall as has been the case recently, they feel the brunt of this realignment. They also have the most to gain from additional flow throughput capacity and therefore would see immediate benefit from QS Energy’s AOT and Joule Heat solutions.
 
This sector is typically nimble and faces few barriers to entry. With clear financial upside for every additional barrel of crude oil that they are able to transport, these companies are often open to new and innovative technology capable of providing greater efficiencies, lower costs and improved cash flow. Upstream producers physically move the most volume of product. They are customers to the Midstream transporters and enter into long-term contractual shipping obligations (tariff-based transportation contracts) with Midstream transporters to secure the movement of product from their fields to the refiners and markets downstream.
 
Producers make the spot market price for every barrel delivered to refinery, minus the transport costs, tariffs, and marketing discounts associated with bringing the product to market. A rough rule of thumb for this market is that the further away they are from the refinery, the higher the transport costs to deliver the product. Discussions with Upstream entities has uncovered strong interest in solutions that unlock chokepoints from their field equipment to the transmission line loading terminals through viscosity reduction (AOT) and optimizing flow by directly heating feedstock (Joule Heat). In addition, this group would also benefit from transporters implementing our AOT transmission-line series due to its ability to increase the overall flow capacity of pipelines transporting product from loading terminals to market.
 
Midstream entities transport the bulk of the world’s crude oil output via the 400,000 miles of crude oil pipelines globally. Domestically, they deliver a large percentage of the U.S. daily production of 9.2 million barrels per day through 160,000 miles of crude pipelines. Midstream operators represent a strong and ready market for both AOT and Joule Heat, and field test deployments for both solutions are underway.
 
The pipeline transport operators’ business model is to charge a tariff to transport each barrel of oil through their pipeline. Due to the high daily volume of oil being transported and its value as a commodity, even incremental performance efficiencies can drive significant reductions in overhead reduction and increases in toll revenues.
 
The potential benefits of the AOT and Joule Heat technologies include increased flow, reduced pipeline operating pressure and reduced friction losses and friction-induced heat build-up, providing economic benefits through increased capacity and toll rate income, and regulatory benefits through reductions in BTU per ton-mile, off-gassing and reduced carbon emissions (CO2).
 
Midstream Gathering Transporters
 
A subset of the Midstream transporters sector is the gathering line operators, this group often functions as a part of the Upstream producers’ operations, or within the Midstream transporter’s operations. Midstream gathering lines are the regional transportation infrastructure that connect Upstream oilfield gathering lines to Midstream long distance main trunk lines. Typically, these pipelines are of a relatively short length (20-100 miles) and have diameters between 6” and 12”, and could benefit from our smaller, lower cost AOT Upstream technology.
Downstream Refineries / Offloading Facilities
 
The third market category of the industry that can potentially benefit from our technologies consists of downstream refineries and rail, truck and marine offloading facilities. AOT viscosity reduction and Joule Heat technologies have the potential to benefit the Downstream market sector through reduced reliance on chemical based flow assurance additives, reduced friction from turbulent pipelines, reduced volatility, and subsequent evaporation mitigation practices and hardware requirements as mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Our Products and Technology
 
AOT Commercial Products
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2012, the Company began the design and engineering efforts required to transition from prototype testing to full-scale commercial unit production. The Company established its supply chain, designs, drawings, engineering, certifications and specifications to comply with the engineering audit processes as dictated by the energy industry regulation processes and North American regulatory bodies. We have built, delivered and tested, under limited duration and conditions, AOT equipment on a high-volume commercial pipeline. We have not proven the commercial viability of this product. Please see “ITEM 1A, Risk Factors”, for a discussion associated with the commercial viability of our products.
 
The first commercial deployment of AOT occurred on the Keystone Pipeline in Udall, Kansas in May 2014, utilizing four AOT pressure vessels in a parallel “4-Pack” configuration for a cumulative capacity of 600,000 barrels per day. This system was operated under normal pipeline operating conditions as reported in the ATS RheoSystems field test summary report dated February 5, 2015. A copy of the ATS summary report is available on the Company website at: https://wsenergy.box.com/ATS-AOT-SummaryRpt. See section titled “Laboratory and Scientific Testing” below for more information on test procedures and results. Subsequent to testing and termination of the TransCanada lease, the AOT 4-Pack was uninstalled and reconfigured for deployment as four individual AOT units.
 
Our second AOT commercial installation was a single AOT deployment initially installed in March 2015 on the Kinder Morgan Crude & Condensate pipeline, which provides takeaway capacity for the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, primarily delivering crude oil condensate. Testing and re-engineering of this unit continued through the remainder of 2015, specifically addressing issues experienced treating crude oil condensate, resulting in a value-engineered unit which was delivered to and installed on the Kinder Morgan condensate pipeline in February 2016, with testing scheduled to begin in March 2016.
 
The Company continues to optimize and value engineer its AOT product line, targeting both Midstream and Upstream markets. In 2016, the Company plans to focus its efforts and resources on finalizing commercialization of the AOT Midstream product line. Development efforts of the AOT Upstream product was temporarily suspended in December 2015. We currently plan to resume AOT Upstream development in the fourth quarter of 2016 depending on the availability of sufficient capital and other resources.
 
Joule Heat Product Development
 
The Company began development its Joule Heat product in 2014, based around the new electrical heat system which reduces oil viscosity through a process known as joule heat, specifically targeting the upstream crude oil transportation market. The Company is designing and optimizing the Joule Heat technology for the upstream oil transportation market. The Company’s first Joule Heat prototype was installed for testing purposes under a joint development agreement with Newfield Exploration Company in June 2015 and the system is operational; however, changes to the prototype configuration will be required to determine commercial effectiveness of this unit. In December 2015, we temporarily suspended Joule Heat development activities to focus Company resources on finalizing commercial development of the AOT Midstream. We currently plan to resume Joule Heat development in 2017 depending on the availability of sufficient capital and other resources.
AOT Commercial Supply Chain
 
The Company has developed a well-established supply chain for fabrication of the commercial AOT and Joule Heat devices. The supply chain consists of multiple component suppliers and manufacturing companies engaged under Independent Contractor Agreements according to their respective fields of expertise. The supply chain entities have been chosen for their ability to work collaboratively with QS Energy and for their existing relationships with current and potential future customers of QS Energy technologies. The external components such as pressure vessels, inlet and outlet piping header systems, personnel and equipment shelters are manufactured under contract with Power Service Inc. with offices in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, and Texas. Internal components such as grid packs, electrical connections and other machined parts are manufactured by Industrial Screen and Maintenance, with offices in Wyoming and Colorado. All equipment is manufactured in the United States of America, using only approved raw materials and vendors for quality control and import/export compliance purposes and meet the certifications and specifications as dictated by our customers and their independent oversight and auditing authorities.

Other components such as power systems, electrical junction boxes, cabling, hardware, switches, circuit breakers, computer equipment, sensors, SCADA/PLC, software and other power and integration equipment are purchased as complete units from various suppliers with operations based throughout North America. All component vendors are required to meet or exceed the same specifications as the parts manufacturers to maintain compliance as dictated by our customers and their independent oversight and auditing authorities.
 
AOT Intellectual Property
 
The Company began its own independent audit process for the updating of its intellectual property portfolio in 2012. The goal of this process was to streamline unnecessary legacy items left over from prior management, consolidate efforts to countries and regions of interest and retire items that were no longer valid or had been replaced with new intellectual property developments. In 2013, the Company retained the law firm of Jones Walker LLP, with operations based in Houston, Texas and began consolidation and streamlining efforts to manage intellectual properties. Since that time, QS Energy has filed two additional provisional patents related to our technologies’ method and apparatus.
 
QS Energy is currently maintaining and licensing from Temple University a portfolio of domestic and international patents, which have either been granted or have been published and are pending subject to final approval by the respective patent agency. Each of these intellectual properties are related to QS Energy’s AOT, Joule Heat and Fuel Injector technologies. The AOT and Joule Heat technologies are being actively developed and marketed by the Company. Active development of QS Energy’s fuel injector technology was suspended in 2013, but the Company continues to maintain a license agreement with Temple University with respect to the underlying patents, and is considering its options to re-start commercialization, sublicense the technology, or terminate the fuel injector license agreement with Temple. For details of the licensing agreements with Temple University, see Financial Statements attached hereto, Note 6. Please see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors below for a discussion of risks associated with these intellectual properties.

Current Business Status
 
We are subject to non-disclosure agreements with national and multi-national upstream and midstream energy production and transportation companies throughout the USA and overseas for evaluation, testing and analysis of our AOT products' value to their systems. The Company has non-disclosure agreements in place with companies located on the following continents:
North America
 Europe
 Africa
 Asia
 Australia
 
Many of these companies have further demonstrated interest in our technology by electing to send crude oil samples to Temple University to test the potential efficacy of AOT technology on oils typical to their operations, results of which are used to provide detailed benefits analysis and determine baseline AOT configurations optimized for each company’s unique operating conditions. Oil samples tested under these non-disclosure agreements include: African crude oil; refinery fuels; black wax and yellow wax crudes from the Uintah Basin; #2 diesel fuel; ultra-low sulfur diesel; Central California crude oil; crude oil condensate; and sour crude oil. Results of laboratory these tests vary greatly depending on properties of the oil samples (viscosity, water content, particulate matter, etc.), and pipeline operating characteristics (oil temperature, flow rate, etc.). All samples tested demonstrated viscosity reductions, with half of the samples measuring viscosity reductions for 40% or more; one quarter of the samples measuring viscosity reductions ranging from 15% to 25%; and one quarter of the samples measuring viscosity reduction ranging from 4% to 6%.
 
The Company is currently in discussions with a large crude oil and transportation company with operations in the Southern United States and gulf coast region. Temple University has tested multiple oil samples provided under a non-disclosure agreement, demonstrating viscosity reductions up to 46% in a laboratory setting.
 
The Company is in active discussions with a large Middle Eastern oil company regarding AOT technology in Middle East, having tested multiple oil samples provided by this oil company at Temple University in 2015 and 2016. The most recent round of testing on Middle Eastern oil company samples was completed early 2017, demonstrating AOT viscosity reductions of 20% to 50% in a laboratory setting. 
 
The Company is currently in discussions regarding AOT technologies with five additional top-tier national and multi-national oil and gas companies.
 
Laboratory and Scientific Testing
 
From 2010 through 2013, the Company worked with the U.S. Department of Energy (“US DOE”) to test its technology at the Department of Energy’s Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (“RMOTC”), near Casper, Wyoming.  This third-party testing independently verified the efficacy of the Company’s technology operating in a controlled facility, using commercial-scale prototype of our AOT equipment. These tests were summarized in the US DOE Rocky Mountain Oilfield Test Center report dated April 4, 2012 (“ROMRC Report”), which reported AOT measured pressure loss reduction of 40% (RMOTC Report, Fig. 1, page 4) and viscosity reduction of 40% (RMOTC Report, Fig. 2, page 4); and reported observed reductions in line-loss and gains in pump operation efficiency across the entire length of the 4.4-mile test pipeline. A copy of the RMOTC April 4, 2012 Report is available on the Company website at: https://qsenergy.box.com/DOE-STWA-RMOTC-Report. A subsequent long-duration (24-hour) test at the RMOTC facility tested the effectiveness of AOT in treating oil overnight, as pipeline oil temperatures and viscosities drop. In its report dated May 3, 2012 to May 4, 2012, US DOE engineers recorded 56% reduction in viscosity of the AOT-treated oil versus untreated oil, with AOT effectively stabilizing oil viscosity throughout the overnight run despite dropping temperatures. A copy of the RMOTC May 3, 2012 to May 4, 2012 report is available on the Company website at: https://qsenergy.box.com/DOE-STWA-RMOTC-Overnight.

Laboratory testing of our AOT technology has been conducted by Dr. Rongjia Tao.  Testing of the technology as applied to crude oil extraction and transmission has been conducted at Temple University in their Physics Department, in addition to the US DOE, at their Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center, located on the Naval Petroleum Reserve #3 Teapot Dome Oilfield, north of Casper, Wyoming. In addition, a group led by Dr. Rongjia Tao, Chairman, Department of Physics of Temple University conducted experiments, using the laboratory-scale Applied Oil Technology apparatus at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (CNR). NIST is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, founded in 1901 in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
 
Independent laboratory testing was also conducted as a collaborative effort by Temple University and PetroChina Pipeline R&D Center (“PetroChina”) in 2012. In its report dated June 26, 2012 (“PetroChina Report”), PetroChina concluded, “The above series of tests show that it is very effective to use AOT to reduce the viscosity of crude oil. We can see that AOT has significantly reduced the viscosity of Daqing crude oil, Changqing crude oil, and Venezuela crude oil, and greatly improved its flow rate.” (PetroChina Report, page 15). A copy of the PetroChina Report is available online at: https://qsenergy.box.com/PetroChina-STWA-Report
 
As previously reported in 2014, QS Energy installed and tested its commercial AOT equipment, leased and operated by TransCanada on TransCanada’s high-volume Keystone pipeline operation.  The first full test of the AOT equipment on the Keystone pipeline was performed in July 2014, with preliminary data analyzed and reported by Dr. Rongjia Tao of Temple University. Upon review of the July 2014 test results and preliminary report by Dr. Tao, QS Energy and TransCanada mutually agreed that this initial test was flawed due to, among other factors, the short-term nature of the test, the inability to isolate certain independent pipeline operating factors such as fluctuations in upstream pump station pressures, and limitations of the AOT device to produce a sufficient electric field to optimize viscosity reduction.  Although Dr. Tao’s preliminary report indicated promising results, QS Energy and TransCanada mutually agreed that no conclusions could be reliably reached from the July 2014 test or from Dr. Tao’s preliminary report. As a result of this test, the Company modified its testing protocols and contracted with an independent laboratory, ATS RheoSystems, a division of CANNON (“ATS”), to perform follow-up tests at the TransCanada facility. This independent laboratory performed viscosity measurements at the TransCanada facility during subsequent testing in September 2014. As detailed in its field test report dated October 6, 2014, ATS measured AOT viscosity reductions of 8% to 23% depending on flow rates and crude oil types in transit. Over the duration of a 24-hour test intended to measure the recovery of the AOT treated oil from its reduced-viscosity treated state to its original pre-treated viscosity, ATS measured viscosity reductions of 23% three hours after treatment and 11% thirteen hours after treatment, with the crude oil returning to its untreated state approximately twenty-two hours after treatment. In its summary report dated February 5, 2015, ATS concluded that i) data indicated a decrease in viscosity of crude oil flowing through the TransCanada pipeline due to AOT treatment of the crude oil; and ii) the power supply installed on our equipment would need to be increased to maximize reduction in viscosity and take full advantage of the AOT technology.  A copy of the ATS summary report dated February 5, 2015 is available on the Company website at: https://qsenergy.box.com/ATS-AOT-SummaryRpt. A copy of the ATS field test report dated October 6, 2014, with certain confidential information redacted, is available on the Company website at: https://qsenergy.box.com/ATS-AOT-Detailed-Report.
 
Although, as reported by ATS, the efficacy of the AOT technology operated in the TransCanada field test was constrained due to limitations of the electric field applied by that unit’s power supply, subsequent analysis by QS Energy personnel of ATS test results compared against laboratory tests performed at Temple University on oil samples provided by TransCanada revealed a single test run in which the electric field generated by the AOT was sufficient to fully treat the oil given operating conditions at the time of the test. In this test run, ATS measured a 23% reduction in viscosity three hours after AOT treatment. Laboratory tests at Temple University performed on a sample of crude oil provided by TransCanada of the same type treated in that specific field test measured a 27% reduction in viscosity in the laboratory immediately following treatment. Allowing for the actual three-hour of recovery time of the field test measurement, the resulting field test viscosity reduction of 23% correlates very well to the 27% viscosity reduction achieved in the laboratory setting.
 
Due to the small sample size of tests performed during the TransCanada field test, results reported by ATS are statistically inconclusive and cannot be relied upon to provide proof of AOT efficacy. While more testing is required to establish the efficacy of our AOT technology, we are encouraged by the findings of our independent research laboratory and the results of subsequent comparative analysis of data collected under laboratory and commercial operating conditions. We look forward to further development and commercialization of our technology. The TransCanada Lease was terminated by TransCanada, effective October 15, 2014. The Company has modified the design of the AOT power supply such that future installations of the AOT device are expected to achieve sufficient electric field to optimize viscosity reduction.

The Company contracted Southern Research Company (“SRI”) in 2015 to perform independent laboratory tests on its prototype Joule Heat units AOT Upstream units. SRI performed tests on a prototype Joule Heat unit in September 2015, which showed promising results in which the Joule Heat prototype was observed to increase crude oil temperatures. In December 2015, we temporarily suspended Joule Heat and AOT Upstream development activities to focus Company resources on finalizing commercial development of the AOT Midstream. Testing terminated at SRI and all prototype equipment was returned to the Company. We currently plan to resume Joule Heat and AOT Upstream development in the fourth quarter of 2016 depending on the availability of sufficient capital and other resources.
 
Competition
 
The oil transportation industry is highly competitive. We are aware of only three currently available competitive technologies in widespread use for reducing the viscosity of oil throughout the world. Many of our competitors have greater financial, research, marketing and staff resources than we do. For instance, oil pipeline operators use heat, diluents such as naphtha and/or natural gasoline, and/or chemical viscosity reduction additives, or chemical drag-reducing agents to improve flow in pipelines. Our research indicates that these methods are either very energy-intensive, or costly to implement on a day to day basis. Management believes that the Company’s AOT technology presents advantages over traditional methods, yet the industry’s willingness to experiment with new technology may pose some challenges in acceptance.
 
We are not aware of any other technology using uniform electrical field crude oil viscosity reduction technology which is designed to significantly improve pipeline operation efficiency. Although we are unaware of any technologies that compete directly with our technologies, there can be no assurance that any unknown existing or future technology will not be superior to products incorporating our AOT technology. Major domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of pipeline flow-improvement chemical solutions include Pemex, Petrotrin, Pluspetrol, Repsol, Glencore, Conoco-Philips, and Baker-Hughes. According to our research, heater skid manufacturers are generally local to the oilfield and pipeline regions, and are comprised of a large number of relatively small businesses in a fragmented industry. Major heater skid manufacturers are Parker, KW International, Thermotech Systems, LTD.
 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
Our research and development activities are not subject to any governmental regulations that would have a significant impact on our business and we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations that apply to our business as it is presently conducted. Our products, as such, are not subject to certification or approval by the EPA or other governmental agencies domestically or internationally. Depending upon whether we manufacture or license our products in the future and in which countries such products are manufactured or sold, we may be subject to regulations, including environmental regulations, at such time.
 
Non-Disclosure Agreements
 
To protect our intellectual property, we have entered into agreements with certain employees and consultants, which limit access to, and disclosure or use of, our technology. There can be no assurance, however, that the steps we have taken to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property or third party development of our technology and/or processes will be adequate, that others will not independently develop similar technologies and/or processes or that secrecy will not be breached. In addition, although management believes that our technology has been independently developed and does not infringe on the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that our technology does not and will not so infringe or that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Management believes that the steps they have taken to date will provide some degree of protection; however, no assurance can be given that this will be the case.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had three (3) full-time employees. As of such date, we also utilized the services of six part-time consultants to assist us with various matters, including engineering, logistics, investor relations, public relations, accounting and sales and marketing. We intend to hire additional personnel to provide services when they are needed on a full-time basis. We recognize that our efficiency largely depends, in part, on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel as and when needed and we have adopted procedures to assure our ability to do so.
