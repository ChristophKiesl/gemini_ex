Overview
Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing effective treatments for cancers with high, unmet medical need. Specifically, we are developing treatments for cancers caused by dysregulated gene expression, i.e., genes are incorrectly turned on or off. The field concerned with regulation of gene expression is called ‘epigenetics’. As cancers are often diseases driven by gene dysregulation, epigenetics is an area of interest for cancer treatment. Our lead epigenetic-based technology, seclidemstat (“SP-2577”), may treat cancers by restoring correct gene expression.
In 2011, Salarius licensed SP-2577 and related compounds from the University of Utah Research Foundation. SP-2577 is a small molecule, administered orally, that inhibits the epigenetic enzyme lysine specific demethylase 1 (“LSD1”). LSD1’s enzymatic activity can cause genes to turn on or off and thereby affect the cell’s gene expression and overall activity. In addition, LSD1 can act via its scaffolding properties, independently of its enzymatic function, to remodel chromatin and alter gene expression, modulating cell fate. In healthy cells, LSD1 is necessary for stem cell maintenance and cell development processes. However, in several cancers LSD1 is highly expressed and acts aberrantly to incorrectly silence or activate genes leading to disease progression. High levels of LSD1 expression are often associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor patient prognosis. In addition, recent data from “LSD1 Ablation Stimulates Anti-tumor Immunity and Enables Checkpoint Blockade” by W. Sheng, et al. and “Inhibition of Histone Lysine-specific Demethylase 1 Elicits Breast Tumor Immunity and Enhances Antitumor Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Blockade” by Y. Qin, et al. suggests that LSD1 plays a role in tumor immune activity. Hence, there has been interest in developing targeted LSD1 inhibitors for treatment of various cancers alone and/or in combination with other approved agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors.

From January 1, 2021 through March 9, 2021, we received approximately $1.5 million from warrants exercised for cash. 
Salarius’ Strategy and Ongoing Programs
Salarius’ goal is to develop SP-2577 for treatment of cancers while attempting to maximize return for investors. To achieve this goal, Salarius' strategy consists of a two-pronged approach: 1) speed-to-market by developing SP-2577 in Ewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcomas and 2) market expansion by developing SP-2577 in larger market indications. 
Development of SP-2577 in Ewing Sarcoma Patients
Due to Ewing sarcoma being a rare pediatric cancer with a lack of treatment options, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") has put in place several different types of incentives for companies pursuing therapeutic 
opportunities for this type of cancer. Salarius has benefited from several of these incentives, including SP-2577’s orphan status designation and designation as a potential treatment for a “rare pediatric disease.” This means that if proven efficacious with a benefit-risk profile that the FDA judges to be positive and supportive of approval, SP-2577 could qualify for priority review and to receive a priority review voucher ("PRV"), although there can be no assurance that Salarius will be able to do so. If received, Salarius would have the ability to sell the PRV to other qualifying pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, in December 2019 Salarius announced that SP-2577 had been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma patients. Fast Track is a process designed by the FDA to expedite the development and review of new drugs with the potential to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill unmet medical needs. The aim is to streamline the drug development and review process by allowing for more frequent communications with the agency to assure that questions and issues are resolved quickly, which often leads to earlier drug approval and access by patients. Salarius initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2021 Salarius announced that the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) had been established and the dose expansion phase of the trial would begin. Salarius also announced that it will be combining SP-2577 with a commonly administered 2nd and 3rd line regimen, topotecan and cyclophosphamide. This modification allows Salarius to treat patients earlier in the continuum of care, increasing its potential addressable patient population, and the modification also facilitates patient access to SP-2577. Additional clinical trials will be necessary to receive FDA approval.
Disease background: Ewing sarcoma is a devastating pediatric and young adult cancer that suffers from a lack of approved targeted therapies. The cause of Ewing sarcoma is a chromosomal translocation involving the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (“EWSR1”) gene and ETS family genes, resulting in expression of a fusion oncoprotein. The resulting oncoprotein has been found to co-localize with LSD1 throughout the genome, making LSD1 an attractive therapeutic target for Ewing sarcoma. Based on data from the National Institute of Health (“NIH”) and physician collaborators, Salarius believes there are approximately 500 Ewing sarcoma patients diagnosed annually in the United States. Current treatment for Ewing sarcoma consists of an intensive chemotherapy regime, radiation and often disfiguring surgeries. Due to the harshness of current treatment options, children and adolescents often experience long-term side effects such as slowed growth and development, learning problems and an increased risk of developing second cancers. According to published literature, including “Management of recurrent Ewing sarcoma: challenges and approaches” by David Van Mater and Lars Wagner, patients with overt metastasis (20-30% of patients) or recurrent disease (~20%) have poor prognosis, with less than a 30% chance of experiencing disease-free survival, and there is currently not a standardized treatment available for recurrent Ewing sarcoma. These are the patients Salarius aims to help.
Development of SP-2577 in Ewing-related Sarcoma (FET-translocated Sarcoma) Patients
Based on SP-2577’s proposed mechanism of action, preclinical data, and encouraging clinical data from our Advanced Solid Tumor trial (see below), Salarius announced that it expanded the Ewing sarcoma dose expansion trial to include a cohort of Ewing-related sarcomas (also referred to as FET-translocated sarcomas). These sarcomas, like Ewing sarcoma, are caused by a chromosomal translocation that involves the FET-family of genes (EWSR1, FUS, or TAF15) which are also found to co-localize with LSD1. Sarcomas of this type include myxoid liposarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, clear cell sarcoma and several other sarcoma subtypes. Salarius believes that there are approximately 1,500 patients with FET-translocated sarcomas diagnosed each year in the United States. Of these, 20-40% are advanced stage patients with a 30-50% 5-year survival. Current treatments are rarely curative and only delay disease progression on average for ~5 months. Salarius is aiming to help these patients.
Development of SP-2577 in FET-translocated sarcomas provides Salarius with additional paths to SP-2577's approval. In addition, because FET-translocated sarcomas are orphan diseases, many of the regulatory incentives for pursuing Ewing sarcoma may also apply to FET-translocated sarcomas. In Salarius' ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, Salarius will enroll up to 30 patients with FET-translocated sarcomas. Fifteen of the 30 patients will be of the myxoid liposarcoma subtype, which is the most common of the FET-translocated sarcoma according to current data. Hence, Salarius will be treating three patient groups across Ewing and Ewing-related sarcomas, each with a potential path to regulatory approval and commercial opportunity. Additional clinical trials will be necessary to receive FDA approval.
Expand SP-2577 Market by Pursuing Large Market Indications
In parallel to Salarius’ development of SP-2577 in Ewing sarcoma and FET-translocated sarcoma patients, Salarius is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Advanced Solid Tumors, including patients with breast, ovarian and 
prostate cancers, as well as patients with sarcomas. LSD1 has been implicated in several advanced solid malignancies, with high levels of LSD1 expression often associated with more aggressive cancers. The possible markets for successful therapies in these indications could be large and thus greatly expand the potential opportunities for SP-2577 outside of Ewing sarcoma. In December 2018, Salarius received FDA approval of the protocol design for a second Phase 1/2 Advanced Solid Tumor study with SP-2577. The trial opened in the second quarter of 2019 and is currently in the dose escalation phase. This trial is studying single agent SP-2577 in advanced malignancies, excluding Ewing sarcoma and central nervous system tumors.
The following table lists Salarius’ programs and their respective stages of development:

Product Candidate | Target | Disease Area | Development Stage | Sponsor 
Clinical | | | | 
SP-2577 | LSD1 | Ewing sarcoma | Phase 1/2, active recruitment | Salarius
SP-2577 | LSD1 | Advanced Solid Tumors | Phase 1/2, active recruitment | Salarius

LSD1 Overview
Background
LSD1 is an enzyme that is, in part, responsible for epigenetic regulation of genes that support cancer growth. According to B. Majello, et al. in “Expanding the Role of the Histone Lysine-Specific Demethylase LSD1 in Cancer”, LSD1 dysregulation is a key driver in multiple malignancies. LSD1 induces a cancer phenotype through its enzymatic activity and through its role as a scaffolding protein in epigenetic complexes. LSD1 is over-expressed in various cancers, and higher levels of LSD1 are often associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, making LSD1 inhibition an area of interest in cancer research.
SP-2577
SP-2577 is a small-molecule LSD1 inhibitor with a novel scaffold. The molecule was discovered using structure-based computational screening coupled with chemical screening and further optimization with structure-activity relationship studies.
Salarius believes that SP-2577 is different from the three other LSD1 inhibitors that have active clinical development programs because in addition to inhibiting LSD1’s enzymatic activity, it also more comprehensively inhibits LSD1’s scaffolding properties. To the best of our knowledge, SP-2577 is one of two reversible LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development. The two other LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development are irreversible inhibitors. SP-2577 has differentiated properties that may allow it to be developed in a broader range of cancer indications and in different combination regimens compared to the other LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development. Thus far, dose escalation data has demonstrated that SP-2577 has a manageable safety profile. Pharmacokinetic data indicates that SP-2577 can be given at dose levels that achieve drug exposure levels in patients above where activity was demonstrated in preclinical studies. Salarius believes that SP-2577’s manageable safety profile will allow for more flexible dosing strategies by potentially having a wide therapeutic window. This is being studied and developed in Salarius’ ongoing clinical program.
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trials
Ewing Sarcoma and Ewing-Related Sarcoma
Salarius is conducting a multi-site, open-label Phase 1/2 trial of SP-2577 for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma or Ewing-related sarcoma (also referred to as FET-translocated sarcoma). Patients must have histologic confirmation of Ewing sarcoma or Ewing-related sarcoma that is refractory or recurrent and must have received one prior course of therapy for the disease. Among other inclusion criteria, patients must be 12 years or older and have a life expectancy of greater than 4 months. 
The primary objectives of this clinical trial are to study the safety and tolerability of SP-2577. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetic assessment, food effects on drug pharmacokinetics, determination of the maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) and assessment of preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity. Additionally, the trial will explore the use of circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”), cell-free DNA (“cfDNA”), Hemoglobin F and changes in molecular signatures of the tumor as pharmacodynamic markers of disease burden, drug effect and tumor response.
In February 2021, Salarius announced that it reached the recommended phase 2 dose and would initiate the dose expansion portion of the trial. Ewing sarcoma patients will be treated in combination with topotecan/cyclophosphamide. FET-translocated sarcoma patients will be treated with single-agent SP-2577. 
Salarius has eight active sites: Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Moffit Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Sarcoma Oncology Center.
Advanced Solid Tumors
Salarius’ second company-sponsored trial is in Advanced Solid Tumors. It is an open-label Phase 1/2 trial of SP-2577 in patients with advanced cancers, excluding Ewing sarcoma. The clinical trial follows a similar format to the Ewing sarcoma trial. Patients must be diagnosed with advanced or recurrent, histologically or cytologically confirmed, solid malignancy that is either metastatic or unresectable. This trial is currently in dose escalation. 
The primary objectives of the clinical trial are to study the safety and tolerability of SP-2577. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetic assessment, food effects on drug pharmacokinetics, determination of the MTD and assessment of preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity. Additionally, the trial will look at Hemoglobin F as an exploratory pharmacodynamic marker.
Ongoing Development Programs
In addition to the aforementioned clinical trials, Salarius is exploring other opportunities with SP-2577, in combination with immunotherapy agents (checkpoint inhibitors), which include patients with select tumor mutations and, in combination with anti-cancer treatment in hematological malignancies.
Recent preclinical studies demonstrated that LSD1 inhibition has the potential to sensitize refractory patients to checkpoint inhibitors. While checkpoint inhibitors have been successful in a subset of patients, they remain ineffective in a large portion of cancer patients. Considering that the checkpoint inhibitor market is already a multibillion-dollar market, drugs that can be used to increase the clinical benefit of checkpoint inhibitors are attractive. Importantly, recent data shows that certain mutations in chromatin modifying complexes (e.g. mutations in the SWI/SNF complex) could increase tumor sensitivity to LSD1’s immunomodulatory effects. Salarius is currently assessing the potential of SP-2577 to be combined with checkpoint inhibitors through ongoing and planned studies.
Cancer patients who harbor select tumor mutations may be more susceptible to LSD1 inhibition. As such, identifying patients with these types of mutations could allow Salarius to enrich for patients that have an increased chance of benefiting from SP-2577 treatment. Salarius is currently conducting preclinical work to identify mutations that may increase patient response to SP-2577’s therapeutic effects.
Strategic Collaborations and License Agreements
The University of Utah Research Foundation
On August 3, 2011, Salarius entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Utah Research Foundation (the “University of Utah”), for the exclusive license with respect to patent rights protecting SP-2577 and related compounds. The patent rights were for a provisional patent. The term of agreement is until the last-to-expire of the patent rights licensed under the agreement, which is expected to be as late as 2037, unless otherwise terminated by law or by the parties pursuant to the agreement.
In further consideration of the rights granted by the University of Utah, Salarius agreed to pay all past patent expenses incurred in filing and prosecuting the patent application, and pay all future patent expenses incurred including filing, prosecuting, enforcing and maintaining the patent right.
Under the terms of the agreement, Salarius may be obligated to make certain future milestone and royalty payments, including: (i) an earned royalty payment based on a single digit percentage of net sales and a required minimum annual royalty payment commencing with the third full calendar year after the first commercial sale in the U.S., Germany, France, Japan or the U.K. ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 per year which minimum payments are fully creditable towards the earned royalty payment with respect to the relevant calendar year, (ii) a sublicensee fee based on a single digit percentage of revenues received by sublicensees, (iii) milestone payments in agreed dollar amounts upon receiving regulatory approvals allowing the marketing and sale of licensed products or licensed methods relating to the patients’ rights in each of the U.S., the European Union and Japan not exceeding $150,000 in the aggregate and (iv) a milestone payment in an agreed dollar amount upon the two year anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product not exceeding $1.0 million.
Either party has a right to terminate the agreement for a breach of or default under the agreement following a 60-day cure period. If Salarius ceases to carry on its business with respect to the patent right granted under the agreement, the University of Utah has a right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ notice. In addition, Salarius may terminate the agreement at any time upon ninety days’ notice to the University of Utah.
HLB Life Sciences - South Korea
On November 25, 2016, Salarius entered into an Exclusive Pharmaceutical Sublicense Agreement with HLB Life Sciences (“HLBLS”), a South Korean company, under which HLBLS sublicensed from Salarius the patent and technology rights related to SP-2577 mesylate salt in South Korea, and for the right to develop, produce, manufacture, use and sell the drug in South Korea. Salarius received from HLBLS a signing milestone payment not exceeding $500,000 upon entering into the agreement and may receive future annual net royalties ranging from 5% to 20% of net sales by HLBLS.
Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s breach under the agreement following a one hundred twenty-day cure period. In addition, Salarius may terminate the agreement upon notice if HLBLS ceases to use commercially diligent efforts for the first commercial sale of a licensed product, or if HLBLS fails to pay any amounts due under the agreement upon thirty days’ notice. In November 2020, Salarius provided notice to HLBLS of its intent to terminate the agreement for HLBLS’ default of its obligations under the agreement. Under the agreement, HLBLS has the opportunity to remedy such default and a final determination on whether the agreement will be terminated is pending. 
Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas
In June 2016, Salarius entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract with Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (“CPRIT”). The grant contract was for an amount up to $18.7 million to fund the development of LSD-1 inhibitor. The grant was subsequently amended to remove $2.6 million related to a discontinued prostate cancer program. This is a 3-year grant award which originally expired on May 31, 2019. However, the Company was approved for an extension with a contract end date of November 30, 2021. 
 Under the agreement, Salarius must provide matching funds equal to 50% of the funds provided by CPRIT. Salarius must make a good faith effort to spend at least 50% of the CPRIT and matching funds within the State of Texas with Texas-based employees or contractors. 
Upon commercialization of SP-2577, and if Salarius’ revenue is above a specified dollar threshold, Salarius is required to pay a single digit percentage of such revenue during the revenue term until CPRIT receives an amount equal to a single digit multiple of the total grant award. The revenue term is determined on a country by country basis as revenue during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of a product or service until there no longer exists any exclusivity for a commercial product or service in such country, which may be as late as 2037. In the event CPRIT receives such specified percentage of the total grant award from Salarius during the revenue term, Salarius will continue to pay CPRIT a reduced revenue sharing percentage during the remainder of the revenue term. Additionally, if Salarius is required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of one or more third parties in order to sell commercial products in any given country, then the revenue sharing percentages may be reduced.
The agreement may be terminated by the mutual consent of the parties or by Salarius at its discretion. CPRIT may also terminate the agreement upon an event of default, which includes Salarius’ failure to conduct the project within 
the scope agreed by the parties, Salarius’ material breach of the agreement, Salarius’ failure to comply with applicable law, or bankruptcy or discontinuation of Salarius’ business operations, among others. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by CPRIT if the allocated funds become legally unavailable during the term and CPRIT is unable to obtain additional funds for such purposes. If CPRIT terminates the agreement prior to the expiration due to an event of default or if Salarius terminates the agreement, CPRIT may require Salarius to repay some or all of the disbursed grant.
Manufacturing
Salarius does not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of SP-2577 or other product candidates that Salarius develops, nor does it have plans to develop its own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. Salarius currently depends on third-party contract manufacturers for all its required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished product candidates for its clinical trials. Salarius currently employs internal resources and third-party consultants to manage Salarius’ manufacturing contractors.
Sales and Marketing
Salarius has not yet defined its sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for SP-2577 or any of Salarius’ other product candidates because its product candidates are still in pre-clinical or early-stage clinical development. Salarius’ commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of its own commercial and specialty sales force. Salarius plans to further evaluate these alternatives when and if it approaches FDA approval for one of its product candidates.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2020, Salarius had a worldwide portfolio of 71 patents and patent applications of which 64 were issued or allowed and 7 are pending applications. This portfolio includes composition of matter and methods of use patents on Salarius’ lead candidate, SP-2577. These patents and patent applications are owned by the University of Utah Research Foundation and are exclusively licensed to Salarius.
In the United States, Salarius’ anticipated first target market, Salarius has two composition of matter patents (US#8,987,335 and US#9,266,838) and two methods of use patents (US#9,642,857, US#9,555,024) protecting SP-2577 and related compounds which will expire in 2032.
In addition to patent protection, Salarius seeks to rely on trade secret protection, trademark protection and know-how to expand its proprietary position around its chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that Salarius consider important to Salarius’ business. Salarius also seeks to protect its intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with Salarius’ employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and by requiring Salarius’ employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant it ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. Further, Salarius seeks trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when Salarius deems appropriate.
LSD1 Inhibition
LSD1 is a widely published epigenetic target and has attracted interest from several large pharmaceutical companies. LSD1 helps drive cancer progression through demethylation of histones and by acting as a scaffolding protein within various activator and repressor complexes. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are four targeted LSD1 inhibitors being actively tested in clinic and are shown in the table below. The listed LSD1 inhibitors are in Phase 1 or 2 trials for a variety of cancer types.

Company | Binding Mechanism | Drug Name | Latest Phase
Salarius | Reversible | SP-2577 | Phase 1/2 
Oryzon | Irreversible | ORY-1001 | Phase 2 
Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb | Reversible | CC-90011 | Phase 2 
Imago | Irreversible | IMG-7289 | Phase 2 

Competitive Differentiation
Salarius believes that SP-2577 is differentiated in its ability to effectively inhibit LSD1’s scaffolding properties in addition to LSD1’s demethylation activity. Compared to irreversible LSD1 inhibitors, Salarius’ molecule has a novel binding mechanism (reversible as opposed to irreversible) and binding location (closer to substrate binding site as opposed to the FAD cofactor of LSD1). This was demonstrated in a study conducted by A. Sehrawat, et al. in “LSD1 activates a Lethal Prostate Cancer Gene Network Independently of its Demethylase Function” with SP-2509, an analogue of SP-2577. Compared to LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development, SP-2577 binds to LSD1 in a different manner, which Salarius hypothesizes may grant it therapeutic advantages over the competition. To further justify this hypothesis, Salarius compared the ability of SP-2577 and an irreversible LSD1 inhibitor, specifically GSK-LSD1 (analogue to GSK’s former clinical candidate), to affect cancer cell growth in vitro. SP-2577 was able to better inhibit cell growth across 32 cancer cell types compared to GSK-LSD1.
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
United States Government Regulation 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Salarius cannot market a drug product candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. 
Drug Development Process
The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:
•completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") for human clinical testing, which must be deemed effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") overseeing each clinical site before each trial may be initiated at that site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Approval (“NDA”) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the nonclinical, clinical and/or manufacturing sites or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, (“API”), and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
Before testing any drugs with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug enters the preclinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP or GMP.
Before commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND must be submitted to the FDA, and the IND must become effective. An IND sponsor must submit the results of pre-clinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, 
may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin if all other requirements, including IRB review and approval, have been met. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with state and federal regulations, including GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval of each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, safety and side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to study metabolism of the drug, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues.
FDA Review and Approval Process
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all non-clinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s toxicology, pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, (“PDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA, because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is 
manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee-typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts-for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post- approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
Orphan Drug Status
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug 
for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union, must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for development and review of new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request that the FDA designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. For a Fast Track-designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or there is a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Salarius has received FDA designation as a potential treatment for a rare pediatric disease for the use of SP-2577 in Ewing’s Sarcoma. Should SP-2577 prove to be efficacious in this disease with a positive benefit/risk ratio, Salarius expects to receive a Priority Review Voucher. The Priority Review Voucher is transferable and may be sold.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
In addition, under the provisions of FDA Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), the FDA established the Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is distinct from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite 
the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request.
Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process by allowing for approval based on a surrogate endpoint likely to predict clinical benefit of the underlying drug, rather than through a direct measure of clinical benefit. Even if Salarius receives one of these designations for its product candidates, the FDA may later decide that its product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide Salarius with a material commercial advantage.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product may be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS or other surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality- control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects’ entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; and
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, Salarius would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of Salarius’ products. Whether or not Salarius obtains FDA approval for a product, Salarius would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before Salarius can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.
Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like 
the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, a clinical trial may proceed in that country. To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, Salarius must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The MAA is similar to the NDA, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
In Canada, biopharmaceutical product candidates are regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which are enforced by the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada (“TPD”). Before commencing clinical trials in Canada, an applicant must complete pre-clinical studies and file a CTA with the TPD. After filing a CTA, the applicant must receive different clearance authorizations to proceed with Phase 1 clinical trials, which can then lead to Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug in Canada, a new drug submission (“NDS”), must be filed with the TPD. If the NDS demonstrates that the product was developed in accordance with the regulatory authorities’ rules, regulations and guidelines and demonstrates favorable safety and efficacy and receives a favorable risk/benefit analysis, the TPD issues a notice of compliance which allows the applicant to market the product.
Other Healthcare Laws
Although Salarius currently does not have any products on the market, Salarius’ current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which Salarius conducts its business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of Salarius’ pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other.
Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, Salarius’ future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for Salarius’ products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for Salarius’ products, and the sale and marketing of Salarius’ products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, 
and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third- party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that any of Salarius’ products are sold in a foreign country, Salarius may be subject to similar foreign laws.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
Because Salarius intends to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, Salarius intends to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal control to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which Salarius will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
If Salarius’ operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to Salarius, Salarius may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of Salarius’ operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state 
healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect Salarius’ ability to operate its business and its financial results.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect Salarius’ future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
In particular, the ACA has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require Salarius to modify Salarius’ business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.
In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of its product candidate.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2016. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of Salarius’ product candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of Salarius’ products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use its products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of its products. Sales of Salarius’ product candidates, and any future product candidates, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of Salarius’ product candidates, and any future product candidates, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for Salarius’ product candidates, and any future product candidates, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step 
therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require Salarius to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of Salarius’ products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and transparency requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit Salarius’ net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider Salarius’ products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover Salarius’ products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow Salarius to sell its products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for Salarius’ products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover its products could reduce or eliminate utilization of Salarius’ products and have an adverse effect on its sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for Salarius’ products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Facilities
Salarius’ principal executive offices are in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, under a month-to-month lease. This facility consists of approximately 1,000 square feet and accommodates Salarius’ general and administrative activities. Additionally, Salarius leases laboratory space from Johnson & Johnson, JLABS facility located adjacent to our corporate office. Salarius does not own any real property. Salarius believes that its leased facility is adequate to meet its current needs and that additional facilities will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet future needs.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2020, Salarius had nine full-time employees and one part-time employee. Salarius has never had a work stoppage, and none of its employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. Salarius considers its employee relations to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Legal Proceedings
Salarius is not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which Salarius believes, if determined adversely to Salarius, would individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. From time to time, Salarius may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
