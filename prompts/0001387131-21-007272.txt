Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We were incorporated on July 26, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada and our fiscal year end is March 31. Our principal executive offices are located at 850 Teague Trail, #580, Lady Lake, FL 32159. At present, we have no subsidiaries.
 
We are a mineral exploration and production company engaged in the exploration, acquisition, and development of mineral properties. Initially, we purchased a 100% interest in an 8-unit claim block (the “Palayan Gold Claim”) containing approximately 82.7 hectares located in the Nueva Ecija provincial of the Republic of the Philippines. The Palayan Gold Claim was assigned to us from Verdasco Enterprises for the sum of $5,000. There has been no production to date, and as of the date hereof, we have no plans to explore the Palayan Gold Claim until such time management deems any such exploration financially viable.
 
On April 2, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Scythian Mining Group Ltd. (“SMG”), a United Kingdom company, to acquire 100% interest in SMG-Gold B.V. (“SMG-Gold”), a Dutch limited liability company (the “SMG-Gold Acquisition”). While the Exchange Agreement was closed on July 7, 2020, it was never finalized because consideration for the transaction was never fully exchanged. On November 18, 2020, our Board of Directors voted unanimously to rescind the transaction and return the SMG-Gold shares to SMG. See Note 3 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information.
 
On January 8, 2021, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Provenance Gold Corporation, a Canadian publicly traded company (“PAU”) to fund and develop a series of 102 lode mineral claims (the “Silver Bow Claims”) and one (1) patented mining claim (the “Blue Horse Claim”) (collectively, the Silver Bow Claims and the Blue Horse Claim shall be hereinafter referred to as the “Project”), all of which are located in Nye County in the State of Nevada (the “Venture”). In accordance with the terms of the JV Agreement, we advanced $100,000 to the Venture. Shortly thereafter, the parties deemed it not to be in their best interests to move forward with the Venture and on March 22, 2021, we entered into a Recission Agreement with PAU, rendering the JV Agreement null and void. As per the terms of the Recission Agreement, PAU refunded the $100,000 advance. See Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information.
 
We continue to seek mineral exploration and production opportunities for investment and/or operation. While we have identified several potential opportunities, no agreements have been reached and there can be no assurance of finalizing any future business endeavor.
 
Government Regulation
 
General
 
Mineral exploration and production activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs to comply with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of any properties we may acquire, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, we must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays. Although we are committed to environmental responsibility and believe we have been in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent application or interpretation of these laws and regulations through judicial review, or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a material adverse effect upon our Company and our results of operations.

Federal Environmental Laws
 
Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores would be considered hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state law equivalents but are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste. If our Company’s mine wastes were treated as hazardous waste under RCRA or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as “Superfund” sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state law equivalents for cleanup, material expenditures could be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities, for other remediation expenditures, or for natural resource damages. Under CERCLA, any present or past owners or operators of a Superfund site generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owners or operators may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our operations, tailings, and waste disposal areas under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and state law equivalents. Air emissions are subject to the Clean Air Act and its state equivalents as well. Additionally, we are subject to other federal and state environmental laws relating to the operation and closure of any of our future mine sites. We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Future changes in federal or state laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon our Company and our results of operations.
Proposed U.S. Mining Legislation
 
A portion of our U.S. mining properties are on unpatented mining claims on federal lands. Legislation has been introduced regularly in the U.S. Congress over the last decade to change the Mining Law of 1872 as amended (the “Mining Law”), under which we hold these unpatented mining claims. It is possible that the Mining Law may be amended or replaced by less favorable legislation in the future. Previously proposed legislation contained a production royalty obligation, new environmental standards and conditions, additional reclamation requirements and extensive new procedural steps which would likely result in delays in permitting. The ultimate content of future proposed legislation, if enacted, is uncertain. If a royalty on unpatented mining claims were imposed, the profitability of our U.S. operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have considered revising regulations governing operations under the Mining Law on federal lands they administer, which, if implemented, may result in additional procedures and environmental conditions and standards on those lands. Any of our Company’s operations which are either outside of the United States or on private patented lands would be unaffected by potential legislation.
 
Any such reform of the Mining Law or BLM and U.S. Forest Service regulations thereunder could increase the costs of mining activities on unpatented mining claims or could materially impair our ability to develop or continue operations which derive ore from federal lands, and as a result, could have an adverse effect on our Company and our results of operations. Until such time, if any, as new reform legislation or regulations are enacted, the ultimate effects and costs of compliance on our Company cannot be estimated.
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Although there can be no assurance, large and well capitalized markets are readily available for all metals and precious metals throughout the world. A very sophisticated futures market for the pricing and delivery of future production also exists. The price for metals is affected by several global factors, including economic strength and resultant demand for metals for production, fluctuating supplies, mining activities and production by others in the industry, and new and or reduced uses for subject metals.
 
The mining industry is highly speculative and of a very high-risk nature. As such, mining activities involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. Few mining projects actually become operating mines.
 
The mining industry is subject to a number of factors, including intense industry competition, high susceptibility to economic conditions (such as price of metal, foreign currency exchange rates, and capital and operating costs), and political conditions (which could affect such things as import/export regulations and foreign ownership restrictions). Furthermore, the mining activities are subject to all hazards incidental to mineral exploration, development and production, as well as risk of damage from earthquakes, any of which could result in work stoppages, damage to or loss of property and equipment and possible environmental damage. Hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations and other conditions are also involved in mineral exploration and development.

Competition
 
The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new and exploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders.
 
Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.
 
We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs. 
 
General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the Philippines, the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international political conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration.
 
In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring or developing profitable gold or mineral properties or interests, and we cannot give any assurance that suitable gold or mineral properties or interests will be available for our acquisition, exploration or development. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the gold or mineral industry by:
 

● | keeping our costs low;
--+-----------------------


● | relying on the strength of our management’s contacts; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities.

Reports to Security Holders
 
We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s future operations.
 
The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our future operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements.
 
While our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of future operations.
