Recent Developments
 
On September 8, 2021, we announced the completion of a retail pilot test in the lobby shops of a leading international hotel chain. The test, initiated by the hotel, was first announced in March 2021. It has been confirmed a success by our hotel partner. As a result, the testing chain has confirmed the decision to launch our Nightfood ice cream into their lobby shop freezers chain-wide with an expected start date in the fourth quarter of 2021 or the first quarter of 2022. We have engaged iDEAL Hospitality Partners Group to secure distribution partnerships with additional global hotel brands, oversee hospitality-related business development initiatives, and provide sales and support during the national hotel rollout.
Industry Overview
 
Nightfood solves the problem of night snacking.
 
Research indicates that humans are biologically hard-wired to load up on sweets and fats at night. Loading a surplus of calories into the body before the long nightly fast is believed to be an outdated survival mechanism from our hunter-gatherer days. Unfortunately, willpower also weakens at night. As a result, over 85% of adults report snacking regularly between dinner and bed, resulting in an estimated 700 million nighttime snack occasions weekly, and an annual spend on night snacks of over $50 billion. Because of our hard-wired cravings, the most popular choices are ice cream, cookies, chips, and candy. These are all understood to be generally unhealthy. They can also impair sleep quality.
 
In recent years, billions of dollars of consumer spend have shifted to better-for-you versions of our favorite snacks. But none of those brands formulated their products for better sleep. Nightfood snacks are not only formulated to be better-for-you, they’re formulated by sleep experts and nutritionists to provide the nutritional foundation to support better sleep.
 
Almost half of all snacking takes place between dinner and bed. Nutrition is an important part of sleep-hygiene, because what one eats at night impacts sleep. Most consumers now seek functional benefits from their snacks, and most consumers would also prefer better sleep.

As the pioneers of the night snack category, Nightfood accepts the responsibility to build the awareness required to grow the nighttime segment of the snack market. Along with that responsibility comes the opportunity to be the category king. We envision a future where nighttime specific, sleep-friendly snacks comprise a multi-billion dollar segment of the estimated $120 billion American snack market.
 
Nightfood ice cream was originally manufactured in eight flavors. These are Full Moon Vanilla, Midnight Chocolate, Cold Brew Decaf, After Dinner Mint Chip, Milk & Cookie Dough, Cherry Eclipse, Bed and Breakfast, and Cookies n’ Dreams. Additional flavors have been developed, both dairy, and non-dairy, for future introduction based on retailer and consumer demand.
 
In February of 2020, Nightfood secured the endorsement of the American Pregnancy Association. With ice cream being the most widely reported pregnancy craving, and with pickles being another food notorious for pregnancy cravings, the Company manufactured and launched a ninth flavor, Pickles For Two.
 
Management believes consumer demand exists for better nighttime snacking options, and that a new consumer category consisting of nighttime specific snacks will emerge in the coming years. This belief is supported by research from major consumer goods research firms such as IRI Worldwide, and Mintel, who identified nighttime specific foods and beverages as one of the “most compelling and category changing trends” for 2017 and beyond. In recent years, CEO’s and other executives from major consumer goods conglomerates such as Nestle, PepsiCo, Mondelez, and Kellogg’s have commented on consumer nighttime snack habits and the opportunity that exists in solving this problem for the marketplace.
 
Nightfood has established a Scientific Advisory Board consisting of sleep and nutrition experts to drive product formulation decisions, and provide consumer confidence in the brand promise. The first member of this advisory board was Dr. Michael Grandner, Director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona. Dr. Grandner has been conducting research on the link between nutrition and sleep for over ten years, and he believes improved nighttime nutritional choices can improve sleep, resulting in many short and long-term health benefits. In March of 2018, the Company added Dr. Michael Breus to their Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Breus, known to millions as The Sleep Doctor™, is believed to be the Nation’s most trusted authority on sleep. He regularly appears in the national media to educate and inform consumers so they can sleep better and lead happier, healthier, more productive lives. In July, 2018, we completed our Scientific Advisory Board with the addition of Lauren Broch, Ph.D, M.S. Dr. Broch is a sleep therapist and former Director of Education & Training at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Weill Cornell Medical College.Dr. Broch also has a master’s degree in human nutrition. This combination allowed her to play an important role in the reformulation of our nutrition bars, and the development of Nightfood ice cream. These experts work with Company management to ensure Nightfood products deliver on their nighttime-appropriate, and sleep-friendly promises.
 
We are a snack development, marketing and distribution company relying on our unique products, positioning, and team to develop and market nutritional/snack foods that are appropriate for evening snacking.
 
Our first product was the Nightfood nutrition bar, manufactured in two flavors (Cookies n’ Dreams, and Midnight Chocolate Crunch). Management chose to discontinue manufacturing and distribution of Nightfood nutrition bars in the 2nd half of calendar 2019 to ensure additional resources available for the ice cream rollout, which Management believes offers a larger and more compelling market opportunity.
 
Management envisions the Nightfood brand ultimately as a “platform brand”, meaning future offerings would not necessarily all remain within the ice cream category. Possibilities exist to expand the product line into additional snack formats that are popular with consumers at night, including things like cookies, chips, and other formats. Additionally, future reintroduction of the Nightfood nutrition bar also remains a possibility.
 
Compared to regular ice cream, Nightfood is formulated with more tryptophan, more vitamin B6, more calcium, magnesium, and zinc, more protein and more prebiotic fiber. Nightfood also contains less fat, less sugar, and fewer calories than traditional ice cream, and is lactose free.
 
In early February of 2019, it was announced that Nightfood had won the 2019 Product of the Year Award in the ice cream category in a Kantar innovation survey of over 40,000 consumers. In June of 2019, it was announced that Nightfood won both the Best New Ice Cream and Best New Dairy Dessert awards at the World Dairy Innovation Awards.
 
Nightfood has secured distribution in divisions of some of the largest supermarket chains in the country, and has received media coverage in outlets such as The Today Show, Oprah Magazine, The Rachael Ray Show, Food Network Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Washington Post, Fox Business News, and many more media outlets.

Our Products, Present and Proposed
 
Nightfood Holdings runs two distinct operating companies, each serving a different market segment with different products.
 
Nightfood, Inc.
 
Nightfood ice cream was originally manufactured in eight flavors. These are Full Moon Vanilla, Midnight Chocolate, Cold Brew Decaf, After Dinner Mint Chip, Milk & Cookie Dough, Cherry Eclipse, Bed and Breakfast, and Cookies n’ Dreams. Additional flavors have been developed, both dairy, and non-dairy, for future introduction based on retailer and consumer demand.
 
In February of 2020, Nightfood secured the endorsement of the American Pregnancy Association. With ice cream being the most widely reported pregnancy craving, and with pickles being another food notorious for pregnancy cravings, the Company manufactured and launched a ninth flavor, Pickles For Two.
 
Compared to regular ice cream, Nightfood is formulated with more tryptophan, more vitamin B6, more calcium, magnesium, and zinc, more protein and more prebiotic fiber. Nightfood also contains less fat, less sugar, and fewer calories, and is lactose free.
 
Management believes consumer demand exists for better nighttime snacking options, and that a new consumer category consisting of nighttime specific snacks is currently emerging.
 
Management envisions the Nightfood brand ultimately as a “platform brand”, which means that, in addition to ice cream, Nightfood could launch products in other snack formats with shared branding. Management believes the hotel vertical can facilitate platforming into additional formats much earlier in the company lifecycle than would be possible or advisable in the supermarket vertical. Development has begun on Nightfood products in additional snack formats that are popular with consumers at night. The timeline for introduction of our next snack format is expected to be the first quarter of calendar year 2022.
 
Additionally, future reintroduction of the Nightfood nutrition bar also remains a possibility.
 
MJ Munchies, Inc.
 
MJ Munchies, Inc. is a Nevada corporation formed in January of 2018 to exploit legally compliant opportunities in the CBD and marijuana edibles and related spaces. The Company initially intended to market some of these new products under the brand name “Half-Baked” and believed that significant opportunities would exist to launch successful and legally compliant products in this space. However, to date, its operations have had a nominal impact on our financial statements and no assurance can be given that we will begin actual production of products using the Half-Baked trademark, or using the mark in a licensing or joint venture arrangement. Even if we were to begin actual production of products and/or find a suitable licensing or joint venture partner, we cannot assure market acceptance of such products, perhaps including THC infused edibles.

Production
 
To date, we have utilized contract manufacturers for producing our products and packaging, and third-party logistics for warehousing and order fulfillment. Management is in the process of adding additional manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated ice cream demand and to provide redundancy that would also allow manufacturing to continue should our primary copacker not be able to manufacture product for us for any reason.
Marketing and Distribution
 
Nightfood ice cream is currently available in approximately 1,700 supermarket locations. These include chains such as Walmart, Shaw’s and Star Markets (a division of Albertsons), Jewel-Osco (also a division of Albertsons), Lowes Foods, Rouses Markets, and Central Market (a division of H-E-B). Nightfood ice cream was recently rotated out of Harris Teeter supermarket locations, a chain that carried Nightfood for approximately two years. The product line has garnered extensive media interest, including coverage from outlets such as Oprah Magazine, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Food Network, The Today Show, Rachael Ray, and more.
 
In February 2021, a leading global hotel brand initiated a test of Nightfood in the lobby shops of one of their chains. Nightfood management was told the purpose of the test was to determine if Nightfood ice cream should be introduced nationally into multiple chains owned by the brand.
 
On September 8, 2021, the Company issued a news release that this test had been confirmed a success by hotel management. That hotel chain has communicated to the Company that a rollout timeline is currently being established, with Nightfood’s inclusion as a brand standard, and it expects to introduce Nightfood ice cream into their hotel freezers is the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021 or the first quarter of calendar year 2022.
 
Management characterizes the sales results from the test as very promising and believes the expected launch into our first major hotel chain and brand will lead to additional hotel distribution across the country due to the unique Nightfood value proposition, which it believes is particularly relevant in the hotel environment. Management projects the hotel vertical will deliver significant distribution and sales growth through the first half of calendar year 2022 and beyond.
 
In addition to hotels potentially generating significant incremental sales with higher gross and net margins than the supermarket vertical, Management believes hotel distribution could support acceleration in the growth of both the Nightfood brand, and the night snack category which the Company is pioneering.
 
Competition
 
The nutritional/snack food business is highly competitive and includes such participants as companies like Mondelez, Nestle S.A., Hershey’s, Hormel, Kraft/Heinz, Kellogg’s, Ferrero, Campbell Soup Company, Utz, General Mills, Mars, The Simply Good Foods Company, Wells Enterprises, Froneri, Unilever, Hostess, PepsiCo, and more. Many of these competitors have well established names and products.
 
In 2019, Nestle announced interest in the nighttime snacking space with the introduction of a candy-type product called GoodNight. In 2020, Pepsi announced the launch of a “relaxation” drink called Driftwell. And in 2021, Unilever announced they had initiated a year-long research study to identify how nutrition could be used to improve sleep, through impact on the gut microbiome. And in September 2021, the Chief Medical Officer of Pepsi stated that Pepsi researchers were examining how foods and beverages affect neurochemical pathways, and that the company was interested in how this research could be used to impact sleep.

Nightfood competes based upon the unique characteristics and positioning of our products and we expect to derive leverage from being the pioneer and creator of the emerging night snack category. However, other companies, including those with greater name recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products. Management believes that if a competitor sought to develop a competing product, it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution in 12-24 months.
 
Based on the current acquisition climate in the consumer goods space, Management believes that successful growth of the Nightfood snack line would likely bring acquisition offers from potential competitors as quickly as it might actually bring competition on the shelf from those same potential competitors.
 
Management views distribution in the hotel vertical as providing a unique and powerful competitive advantage within the night snack category. In that vertical, the Nightfood brand could be more insulated from potential competition than in the supermarket environment. In addition, deep and wide hotel penetration could serve to entrench Nightfood as the leading snack brand within the night snack category, with a de-facto endorsement by the hotel industry as other competitors are left to compete in other segments of the marketplace.
 
The very nature of the hotel lobby shops, with small footprint and limited selection, projects to allow Nightfood a protected position in that space during the formative years of the category. Furthermore, management believes widespread hotel rollout of Nightfood snacks will serve to validate the concept of sleep-friendly nutrition and night snacks in the minds of consumers, potentially accelerating its adoption in all relevant retail verticals.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We own the registered trademark “Nightfood®” for the nutrition bar/snack/meal replacement category, and the ice cream category. In September, 2021, the Company also submitted for federal trademark protection for the Nightfood mark in the categories of cookies, chips, and candy. We believe these marks will prove important and valuable to our business as we continue to pioneer the development of a new category of snacks that support relaxation with a sleep-friendly nutritional profile, specific to consumption at night, between dinner and bedtime.
 
Additionally, we own the domain Nightfood.com as well as many other relevant domains such as late-night-snack.com, nighttimesnack.com, and nighttimesnacking.com, as well as Nightfood.us, Nightfood.net, TryNightfood.com, GetNightfood.com, NiteFood.com, TryNightfood.com, BuyNightfood.com, NightSnacking.com, and Night-Food.com. We also own the toll-free number 888-888-NIGHT.
 
Nightfood’s formulae and recipes are proprietary, and we have non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers.

MJ Munchies owns a registered trademark for “Half-Baked” in the State of California relating to marijuana edibles, and has two pending federal trademark applications for “Half-Baked” relating to packaged snacks and beverages. We can give no assurance that the federal trademark applications will be approved, or that if approved, it will not face legal challenges. We also acquired the HalfBaked.com domain, and several other related domain names and intellectual property assets. 
 
Personnel
 
Nightfood has no employees. Our CEO, Sean Folkson, and other key team members have consulting agreements with the Company. Through vendor and consultant relationships, Nightfood over one dozen team members contributing to our operations on a regular basis. Should we be successful in executing our business plan, we anticipate potentially hiring employees at some point to assist with various company functions. However, we also expect to continue to strategically outsource significantly to accomplish work that might otherwise be done by employees in a more traditional company.
Customers
 
Our customers consist primarily of supermarkets and entities that distribute ice cream products to supermarkets and other retail outlets. In FY 2021, we had one customer that accounted for over 30% of our Gross Sales. Two other customers each accounted for 15% and 23%. In FY 2020, we had one customer that accounted for approximately 41% of our Gross Sales and eight other customers each accounted for between 3.7% and 9.7% of our Gross Sales.
Vendors
 
During the year ended June 30, 2021, one vendor accounted for more than 10% of our operating expenses. During the year ended June 30, 2020, one vendor accounted for more than 10% of our operating expenses.
DEVELOPMENT PLANS
 
Nightfood has nine ice cream flavors currently in ongoing production, and additional ice cream products have been developed or in late stages of development, these include additional flavors of Nightfood dairy-based ice cream as well as several flavors of non-dairy oat-based ice cream. In addition, Management believes the market exists for nighttime, sleep-friendly snacks in other formats in addition to ice cream pints, some of which are currently in development as of the date of this filing.
