We operate as a holding company with operations conducted primarily through our subsidiaries. We conduct our activities in a manner so as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Generally, this means that we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business and that no more than 40% of our total assets will be invested in investment securities, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. Pursuant to the Investment Company Act, companies such as our subsidiary DP Lending are excluded from the definition of an investment company since its business consists of making small loans and industrial banking. We also maintain a considerable investment in Avalanche International, Corp., which does business as MTIX International.
 
Originally, we were primarily a solution-driven organization that designed, developed, manufactured and sold high-grade customized and flexible power system solutions for the medical, military, telecom and industrial markets. Although we actively seek growth through acquisitions, we will also continue to focus on high-grade and custom product designs for the commercial, medical and military/defense markets, where customers demand high density, high efficiency and ruggedized products to meet the harshest and/or military mission critical operating conditions.
 
We have operations located in Europe through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gresham Power Electronics (f/k/a Digital Power Limited) (“Gresham Power”), located in Salisbury, England. Gresham Power designs, manufactures and sells power products and system solutions mainly for the European marketplace, including power conversion, power distribution equipment, DC/AC (Direct Current/Active Current) inverters and UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) products. Our European defense business is specialized in the field of naval power distribution products.
 
On November 30, 2016, we formed DP Lending, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Commencing in October of 2019 and continuing through February of 2020, the Company reorganized its corporate structure pursuant to a series of transactions by and among the Company and its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries. The purpose of the reorganization was to align the Company’s various businesses by the products and services that constitute the majority of each subsidiaries’ revenues. As a result of the foregoing transactions, the Company’s corporate structure is as follows:
 


On December 23, 2019, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement whereby Ault & Company, Inc. would purchase an aggregate of 660,667 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price per share of $1.12, subject to the approval of the NYSE American, for a total purchase price of $739,948. The purchase was authorized by the NYSE American on January 15, 2020. As a result, at the closing on January 15, 2020, Ault & Company became the beneficial owner of 666,945 shares of Common Stock, or up to 19.99% of the Common Stock then outstanding.
 
On February 5, 2020, we sold and issued an 8% Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $1,000,000 (the “Note”) to Ault & Company, Inc. The principal amount of the Note, plus any accrued and unpaid interest at a rate of 8% per annum, shall be due and payable on August 5, 2020. The Note shall be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) at a conversion price of $1.45 per share, subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting thereof, as required by Rule 713(a)(ii) of the NYSE Company Guide, and subsequently, authorization from the NYSE American. 
 
On February 10, 2020, we entered into a Master Exchange Agreement (the “Master Exchange Agreement”) with Esousa Holdings, LLC (“Esousa” or the “Creditor”) that acquired approximately $4.2 million in principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, of certain promissory notes that had been previously issued by us to Dominion Capital, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company (the “Dominion Note”) and the Canadian Special Opportunity Fund, LP (the “CSOF Note” and with the Dominion Note, the “Esousa Purchased Notes”) in separate transactions. The Creditor also agreed to purchase additional notes up to an additional principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, of $3.5 million (the “Additional Notes” and collectively, with the Esousa Purchased Notes, the “Notes”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Creditor has the unilateral right to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Exchange Shares”) in exchange for the Notes, which Notes evidence an aggregate of up to approximately $7.7 million of indebtedness of the Company. In aggregate, we have issued to Esousa a total of 8,332,904 Exchange Shares.

Settlement of Derivative Litigation
 
On February 24, 2020, we entered into a definitive settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) intended to settle the previously disclosed derivative litigation captioned Ethan Young and Greg Young, Derivatively on Behalf of Nominal Defendant, DPW Holdings, Inc. v. Milton C. Ault, III, Amos Kohn, William B. Horne, Jeff Bentz, Mordechai Rosenberg, Robert O. Smith, and Kristine Ault and DPW Holdings, Inc., as the nominal defendant (Case No. 18-cv-6587) (as amended on March 11, 2019, the “Amended Complaint”) against the Company and certain of its officers and directors pending in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the “Court”). As previously disclosed, the Amended Complaint alleges violations including breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment claims based on the previously pled transactions.
 
On April 15, 2020, the Court issued an Order (the “Order”) approving a Motion for Preliminary Approval of Settlement in the Derivative Action. On July 16, 2020, the Court issued an Order (the “Final Order”) approving a Motion for Final Approval of Settlement in the Derivative Action filed against DPW as a Nominal Defendant and its directors who served on its board of directors on July 31, 2018 who were not dismissed from the action as a result of the Court’s partial grant of the Motion.
 
On July 16, 2020, the Court entered a Judgement based upon the Final Order.
 
Under the terms of the Final Order approving the Agreement, the Board shall adopt and/or maintain resolutions and amendments to committee charters and/or the Company’s bylaws to ensure adherence to certain corporate governance policies (collectively, the “Reforms”), which shall remain in effect for no less than five (5) years, subject to any of the following: (a) a determination by a majority of the independent directors that the Reform is no longer in the best interest of the Company, including, but not limited to, due to circumstances making the Reform no longer applicable, feasible, or available on commercially reasonable terms, or (b) modifications which the Company reasonably believes are required by applicable law or regulation.
 
In connection with the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed upon a payment of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $600,000 payable by the Company’s Director & Officer liability insurance, which sum was paid. The Settlement Agreement contains no admission of wrongdoing. The Company has always maintained and continues to believe that it did not engage in any wrongdoing or otherwise commit any violation of federal or state securities laws or other laws.
 
Strategy
 
As a holding company, our business strategy is designed to increase shareholder value. Under this strategy, we are focused on managing and financially supporting our existing subsidiaries and partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to shareholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: public offerings, the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize shareholder value, such as activist trading. We anticipate returning value to shareholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.
 
On October 7, 2019, we created an Executive Committee which is comprised of our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. The Executive Committee meets on a daily basis to address the Company’s critical needs and provides a forum to approve transactions which are communicated to our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance on a bi-weekly basis by our Chief Executive Officer.
 
Our Executive Committee approves and manages our investment and trading strategy. The Executive Committee has decades of experience in financial, investing and securities transactions. Led by our Founder and Executive Chairman, Milton “Todd” Ault III, we seek to find undervalued companies and disruptive technologies with a global impact. We also use a traditional methodology for valuing securities that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. Upon making an investment, we often become actively involved in the companies we seek to acquire. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve stockholder value, to acquiring a controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business. Mr. Ault relies heavily on Mr. William B. Horne, the Company’s Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Henry Nisser, the Company’s President and General Counsel, to provide analysis and guidance on all acquisition targets and throughout the acquisition process.

From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our shareholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, transactions in their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these and functionally equivalent programs and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our shareholders.
 
Our Executive Committee acts as the underwriting committee for our subsidiary DP Lending and approves all lending transactions. Under its business model, DP Lending generates revenue through origination fees charged to borrowers and interest generated from each loan. DP Lending may also generate income from appreciation of investments in marketable securities as well as any shares of common stock underlying convertible notes or warrants issued to DP Lending in any particular financing. DP Lending’s activities are more fully described elsewhere in this Annual Report; see page 10.

We anticipate returning value to shareholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.
 
Over the recent past we have provided capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of businesses in defense/aerospace, industrial, telecommunications, medical and textiles. We have provided capital to subsidiaries as well as partner companies in which we have an equity interest or may be actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support.
 
Markets
 
We sell our custom power system solutions, high-grade flexibility series power supply products and value-added services to customers in a diverse range of commercial and defense industries and markets throughout the world, with an emphasis on North America and Europe. Our current customer base consists of approximately 220 companies, some of which are served through our partner channels. We serve the North American power electronics market primarily through our domestic wholly owned subsidiary Digital Power Corporation, whereas the European marketplace is served through Gresham Worldwide, another wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
Gresham Worldwide’s operations focus exclusively on the market for electronic solutions that support the defense industry and other mission critical applications. The essential nature of these applications provides a degree of insulation from volatility associated with other segments of the global economy while accounting for stability and steady growth of the addressable market opportunities available to Gresham Worldwide in segments that it serves. Demand for solutions to meet these requirements continues unaffected, and in many instances increases, in times of global crisis. Total defense spending in the three countries in which Gresham Worldwide currently operates will total more than an estimated $813 billion in 2021. Gresham Worldwide sells to the militaries and defense contractors in 18 other countries as well. Overall global defense spending is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 3% through 2023, with US spending growing at almost a 5% CAGR in the same period.
 
The drive for increased situational awareness and close coordination of air, land, sea, space and cyber operations will fuel an increase in defense electronics subsystems and components with total spending in 2020 of $131 billion and a projected CAGR of 5.6% through 2024, according to Global Defense Electronics Market, Trends, Driver and Outlook for 2020 and Beyond, Renaissance Strategic Advisors, September 2020. The drive for greater connectivity and analytics will in turn increase demand for RF communications, power solutions and electronic control systems content in new major military platforms, right in the sweet spot of Gresham Worldwide operating units.
 
Tens of thousands of companies compete in this market to deliver electronics solutions to meet defense and other mission critical applications. However, Gresham Worldwide’s operating units have longstanding relationships with dominant defense contractors in the US (Lockheed, BAE Systems, L3Harris, Raytheon, Boeing), in the UK (BAE, Rolls Royce, Thales, Bombardier) and in Israel (IAI, Rafael, Elbit) which hold contracts for major defense platforms with very long life cycles. These relationships enable Gresham Worldwide to narrow the field of competition considerably and thereby to grow based on repeat business with relatively low selling costs.

Beyond the defense arena, initiatives to complete $50 billion in upgrades to the current National Railway System in the UK over the next five years while spending $130 billion over the next 10 years to build a high speed rail to link London with the Midlands cities of Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester will generate significant opportunities for growth in demand for power solutions to upgrade and replace current infrastructure, both in rolling stock and track side controls. Relec Electronics’ current relationships and track record for supplying power solutions to the UK rail industry position Gresham Worldwide ideally to capitalize on these ongoing refurbishment and expansion efforts. A similarly robust market in the medical power supply markets with a CAGR at 5.4%, to reach $4.4 billion in 2022, creates tremendous growth opportunities for our Relec Electronics subsidiary in the UK.
 
We sell products to our OEM customers through direct sales or through our sales channels, including our manufacturers’ representatives and distributors. Our sales strategy is to identify and focus on strategic accounts. This strategy allows us to maintain a close and direct relationship with such accounts, which positions us as the supplier of choice for these customers’ challenging, innovative and demanding new product requirements. In striving for additional market share, we simultaneously seek to strengthen our traditional sales channels of manufacturer representatives and distributors. We plan to continue to build more channels and increase our market share through 2021.
 
Commercial Customers. We serve global commercial markets including medical, telecom, and industrial companies. Our products are used in a variety of applications and operate in a broad range of systems where customers require mission critical power reliability and occasionally extreme environmental conditions. Our commercial customers include Elma GmbH, BioSense Webster, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, RS Components, Farnell, Parker Hannifin, Vanderbilt, Bombardier.
 
Military/Defense Customers. We have developed a broad range of rugged product solutions for the military and defense market, featuring the ability to withstand harsh environments. These ruggedized product solutions, which include both custom modifications and full custom designs, are designed for combat environments and meet the requirements of our defense customers. We manufacture our military products through a domestic manufacturer that complies with US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and is certified to perform such manufacturing services. We are compliant with the ITAR regulations and are an approved vendor for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Army.
 
At the core of every military electronic system is a power supply. Mission critical systems require rugged high performance power platforms that will operate and survive the harsh environmental conditions placed upon such systems. Our power supplies, which include the following, function effectively in these severe military environments, including Missiles – Ground-to-Air, Air-to-Air and Sea-to-Air; Naval – Naval power conversion and distribution; Mobile and Ground Communications – Active Protection, Communications and Navigation; Artillery – Gyro modular azimuth position and navigation system; Surveillance, test equipment; and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) – Very lightweight power systems.
 
Our military products meet the relevant defense standards MIL-STD in accordance with the Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures. Space, weight, output power, electromagnetic compatibility, power density and multiple output requirements are only part of the challenges that any military power supply design faces. With many decades of experience, our engineering teams meet these tough challenges. Our power supplies are a critical component of many major weapon systems worldwide.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary Gresham Power develops and manufactures some military and defense products mainly being deployed in several naval fleets.

We believe that this business model provides an incentive to our customers to be committed to high-volume production orders.
 
High-Grade Flexibility Series Power Supply Product. We offer our feature rich based power rectifiers that support flexible configuration and high-grade design implementation. This includes innovative designs and implementation including DSP control for Power Factor Correction (“PFC”) and DC/DC, synchronous rectifier outputs under DSP control, two phase PFC, hot pluggable, current sharing and other features. While some of our customers have special requirements that include a full custom design, other customers may require only certain electrical changes to standard power supply products, such as modified output voltages, unique status and control signals, and mechanical repackaging tailored to fit the specific application. We offer a wide range of standard and modified standard products that can be easily integrated with any platform across our diversified market segments. 
 
Value-Added Services. In addition to our custom solutions and high-grade flexibility series proprietary products that we offer, we also provide value-added services to OEMs. We incorporate an OEM’s selected electronic components, enclosures, cable assemblies and other compliance components into our power system solutions to produce a power subassembly that is compatible with the OEM’s own equipment and specifically tailored to meet the OEM’s needs. We purchase parts and components that the OEM itself would otherwise attach to, or integrate with, our power systems, and provide the OEM with the integration and installation service, thus eliminating the need for complex, time-consuming and costly system integration. We believe that this value-added service is well suited to those OEMs that wish to reduce their vendor base and minimize their investment in manufacturing, which would lead to increased fixed costs. Given access to these value-added services, the OEMs do not need to build assembly facilities to manufacture their own power sub-assemblies and thus are not required to purchase individual parts from many vendors.
 
Gresham Worldwide, Inc.
 
Gresham Worldwide provides defense solutions with operations conducted by Microphase, Enertec, Gresham Power and Relec
 
Gresham Power (formerly known as Digital Power Limited)
 
Gresham Power designs, manufactures, and distributes switching power supplies, uninterruptible power supplies and power conversion and distribution equipment frequency converters for the commercial and military markets, under the name Gresham. Frequency converters manufactured by Gresham are used by naval warships to convert their generated 60-cycle electricity supply to 400 cycles. This 400-cycle supply is used to power their critical equipment such as gyro, compass, and weapons systems. Gresham also designs and manufactures transformer rectifiers for naval use. Typically, these provide battery supported back up for critical DC systems, such as machinery and communications. In addition, higher power rectifiers are used for the starting and servicing of helicopters on naval vessels, and Gresham now supplies these as part of overall helicopter start and servicing systems. We believe that Gresham products add diversity to our product line, provide greater access to the United Kingdom and European markets, and strengthen our engineering and technical resources.

Manufacturing and Testing
 
Consistent with our strategy of focusing on custom design products and high-grade flexibility series products, we aim to maintain a high degree of flexibility in our manufacturing through the use of strategically focused contract manufacturers. We select contract manufacturers to ensure that they will meet our near-term cost, delivery, and quality goals. In addition, we believe these relationships will eventually give us access to new markets and beneficial cross-licensing opportunities. The competitive nature of the power supply industry has placed continual downward pressure on selling prices. In order to achieve our low-cost manufacturing goals with labor-intensive products, we have entered into manufacturing agreements with certain contract manufacturers domestically and in Asia.
 
We are continually improving our internal processes, while monitoring the processes of our contract manufacturers, to ensure the highest quality and consistent manufacturing of our power solutions. We test all of our products under stress operating conditions per defined test procedures we developed as part of the production process. This approach ensures that our customers can use our power supplies right out of the box. Customer specific testing services are offered with custom designed test stands to simulate operation within our customer applications.

DP Lending
 
DP Lending provides funding to businesses through loans and investments. DP Lending offers a variety of loan types including commercial loans, convertible notes and revolving lines of credit. DP Lending is engaged in providing commercial loans to companies throughout the United States to provide them with operating capital to finance the growth of their businesses. The loans are primarily short-term, ranging from six to twelve months, but may be of longer duration. These terms are subject to change as market needs dictate, and DP Lending anticipates offering additional products in the future.

DP Lending uses its considerable financial experience, data analytics, and a credit scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of each small business borrower applicant. If the business meets DP Lending’s criteria, DP Lending sets the initial interest rate according to its credit and financial models. The final interest rate offered to the borrower will be determined by DP Lending’s interpretation of the marketplace. In order to borrow from DP Lending, borrowers must display characteristics indicative of durable business and financial situations. These include factors such as revenue, time in business, number of employees, and financial and credit variables. In order to qualify, business borrower applicants must be approved through DP Lending’s underwriting process, which analyzes credit and financial data of both the business and the business owner. DP Lending takes into account several business factors (including revenue, age of business, cash flows, and other variables). The underwriting process determines the loan amount to approve, how loans will be priced, and whether to include a blanket lien is based on the above analysis, as well as additional factors (including length of loan, estimated default rates by type and grade, and general economic environment).
 
Our Executive Committee, which is comprised of our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, acts as the underwriting committee for DP Lending and approves all lending transactions. The Executive Committee has decades of experience in financial, investing and securities transactions. Under its business model, DP Lending generates revenue through origination fees charged to borrowers and interest generated from each loan. DP Lending may also generate income from appreciation of investments in marketable securities as well as any shares of common stock underlying convertible notes or warrants issued to DP Lending in any particular financing.
 
As noted above, we will from time to time, through DP Lending, engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our shareholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, transactions in their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these and functionally equivalent programs and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our shareholders.
 
During 2021, we anticipate providing significant new funding to expand DP Lending’s loan and investment portfolio. DP Lending loans made or arranged pursuant to a California Financing Law license (Lic.no. 60 DBO77905).


ACS
 
ACS operates a data center and conducts bitcoin mining at a 617,000 square foot energy-efficient facility located on a 34.5 acre site in southern Michigan with the ability to offer up to 300MWs of critical power capacity. The data center was acquired on February 1, 2021 and revenue from the existing commercial real estate operations began being recognized during the quarter ending March 31, 2021 and, upon completion of the initial buildout of 30,000 square feet, or the equivalent of 1,000 cabinets capable of housing over 40,000 servers, recognition of revenue from the enterprise cloud data center is expected to begin during the quarter ending June 30, 2021.
 
The buildout of the initial 30,000 square feet will be for colocation services, including build-to-suit arrangements, in which customers will be provided with secure, reliable and robust environments for hardware and access to network connectivity that are necessary to aggregate and distribute information. By initially focusing on colocation services that range from a single rack to multi-megawatt hyperscale requirements, we will be able to minimize our capital and operating expenses and also provide an attractive alternative to companies that either host internally and need additional capacity or are evaluating build vs. buy alternatives. We expect that revenues from the colocation services will be primarily based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation for a predetermined amount of allocated power and related interconnection offerings. Ultimately, we intend to expand our service offerings to include managed cloud computing, in other words the on-demand availability of various technology resources, such as compute, storage and network. While we believe the Facility and its anticipated future operations will be successful, there is a risk that its expectations will not materialize in a timely manner, if at all.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market our products directly through our internal sales force as well as through our channel partners including independent manufacturer representatives and distributors. Each manufacturing representative promotes our products in a particular assigned geographic territory. Generally, the manufacturing representatives have the opportunity to earn exclusive access to all potential customers in the assigned territory as a result of achieving their marketing and sales goals as defined in the representative agreement. Our manufacturer representative agreements provide for a commission equal to 5% of gross sales of new “design-in” and 1.75% to 2.0% of gross sales for retention, payable after products are shipped to the customer in the assigned territory. Typically, either we or the manufacturing representatives are entitled to terminate the manufacturing representative agreement upon 30 days’ written notice.
 
Gresham Power Electronics makes limited use of channel partners including independent manufacturer representatives and strategic operating partners in the Middle East, India and Australia. These representatives promote our products and serve as the customer interface for Gresham Power in specific parts of the world as agreed. Typically, either we or the manufacturing representatives are entitled to terminate the manufacturer representative agreement upon 30 days’ written notice.
 
Our Relec subsidiary advertises in highly targeted industry-specific publications such as Electronics Weekly, New Electronics, Electronic Product Design & Test, Electronics Specifier, Components In Electronics, Design Products & Applications, Rail Technology Magazine, Rail Engineer, Rail Professional. In addition, Relec also posts regular podcasts on topics of interest to customers and prospect as well as running an active PR campaign to get placements of earned media and coverage in a wide range of media. We look to replicate similar campaigns in other operating subsidiaries to generate inquiries/leads, raise awareness of Gresham Worldwide and support talent recruiting efforts.
 
We provide comprehensive collateral materials including product data sheets, participation in trade shows, and our websites, www.digipwr.com and www.microphase.com. We use our website to emphasize our capabilities and marketing direction. All products specifications are uploaded onto our websites and accessible to the marketplace. We will continue to enhance our websites by adding more features and functionalities, such as e-commerce, that will allow our customers to make direct purchases through our website. Our future promotional activities will likely include advertising in industry-specific publications, as well as public relations for our new products.


Engineering and Technology
 
Our engineering and product development efforts are primarily directed toward developing new products in connection with custom product design and modification of our standard power systems to provide a broad array of individual models.
 
Our new custom product solutions are driven by our ability to provide to our customers advanced technology that meets their product needs and supports special operation and environmental requirements, with a short turnaround time and a very competitive price point. We believe that we are successfully executing our strategic account focus, as evidenced by the award of second and third generation product development contracts from some of these customers. Our standard contract for custom power solutions includes a multi-year high-volume production forecast that could allow us to secure long-term production guarantees while providing an environment that promotes the development of our IP portfolio.
 
We also outsource some of our product development projects to engineering partners in order to achieve the best technological and product design results for the targeted application customer requirements. When required, we also modify standard products to meet specific customer requirements, including, but not limited to, redesigning commercial products to meet MIL-STD requirements for military applications based on commercial off the shelf (“COTS”) products and for other customized product requirements, when applicable. We continually seek to improve our product power density, adaptability, and efficiency, while attempting to anticipate changing market demands for increased functionality, such as PFC controlled DSP, customized firmware and improved EMI (electromagnetic interference) filtering. We continue to attempt to differentiate all of our products from commodity-type products by enhancing, modifying and customizing our existing product portfolio, using our engineering integrating laboratory located in California.

Competition
 
The power system solutions industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Our competition includes hundreds of companies located throughout the world, some of which have advantages over us in terms of labor and component costs, and some of which may offer products superior or comparable in quality to ours. Many of our competitors, including Bel Fuse, Artesyn Embedded Technologies, TDK-Lambda, Delta Electronics, Murata and Mean-Well Power Supplies, have substantially greater fiscal and marketing resources and geographic presence than we do. If we are successful in increasing our revenues, competitors may notice and increase competition efforts with our customers. We also face competition from current and prospective customers who may decide to internally design and manufacture power supplies needed for their products. Furthermore, certain larger OEMs tend to contract only with larger power supply manufacturers.
 
We anticipate in the current economic situation, that additional competitors may enter into strategic alliances or even acquisitions. Competition could thus become more problematic if consolidation trends in the electronics industry continue and some of the OEMs to which we sell our products are acquired by larger OEMs. To remain competitive, we must continue to compete favorably on the basis of value by providing reliable manufacturing, offering customer-driven engineering services including custom design and manufacturing, continuously improving quality and reliability levels, and offering flexible and reliable delivery schedules.
 
We believe that our power system solutions and advanced technology is superior to our competitors’ power supplies mainly because we use the latest power technology processing and controls which make these power supplies highly customized and efficient. The power-to-volume ratio makes our power solutions more compact compared to what is offered by our competitors and is suitable in custom infrastructures to meet our customers’ requirements.
 
Another advantage of our power system solutions product line is based on the “Flexible” series that employs adjustable power range and a selectable number of output product design platforms. We believe we have a competitive position with our targeted customers that need a high-quality, compact product, which can be readily modified to meet the customer’s unique requirements. We have designed the base model power system platform so that it can be quickly and economically modified and adapted to the specific power needs of any hosting platform or OEM. This “flexibility” approach has allowed us to provide samples of modified power systems to OEM customers only a few days after initial consultation, an important capability given the emphasis placed by OEMs on “time to market.” It also results in very low non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) expenses. Because of reduced NRE expenses, we do not generally charge our OEM customers for NRE related to tailoring a power system to a customer’s specific requirements. We believe this gives us an advantage over our competitors, many of which charge their customers for NRE expenses.
 
The markets in which Microphase operates is also highly competitive and sensitive to technological advances. Many of Microphase’s competitors are larger than it is and maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. Principal competitive factors in Microphase’s markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.


In the RF Communications market, principal competitors for filter components products include K& L Microwave, a Dover company located in Salisbury, MD; RS Microwave, a privately held company headquartered in Butler, NJ; Lorch Microwave of Salisbury, MD, a member of the Smith Group, a global technology company listed on the London Stock Exchange; and Delta Diversified Products, a private company based in Arizona.
 
In the Video amplifier segment, principal competitors for Detector Log Video Amplifier Sensor products include American Microwave Corporation, a privately held company headquartered in Frederick, MD; Akon Inc., a privately held company based in San Jose, CA; Planar Monolithics Industries, a privately held company based in Frederick, MD; L-3 Narda-Miteq, a subsidiary of L-3 Communications Inc., a publicly traded company based in New York, NY; and Signal Technology, a subsidiary of Crane Co., a publicly traded company based in Stamford, CT.
 
Our Enertec subsidiary faces direct competition from smaller firms than itself such as Nir Or, EPS, MER, Alexander Schneider, Symcotech and Chaban, which specialize in components of electronic solutions. Offering end-to-end, turnkey solutions gives Enertec a competitive advantage over other private contractors competing to provide the Israeli MOD and major OEMs with electronic systems and components. That competitive advantage renders roughly 80% of Enertec’s business de facto “sole source” work without other viable competition.
 
Gresham Power confronts competition from Ultra Electronics and Rolls Royce. As in the case of Microphase, elegant designs, strong engineering and a long track record for delivering ultra-reliable high quality power electronics solutions enables Gresham Power to compete effectively.

Relec competes against many other distributors of power electronics and display offerings, facing competition from the likes of Fidus Power Ltd, Mouser Electronics and Avnet Abacus as well as power supply and electronics manufacturers like XP and ABB who sell direct, many of which have significantly more fiscal and marketing resources than Relec. However, a high touch, customer-focused approach enables Relec to compete effectively against high volume distributors and direct selling manufacturers. Optimizing and designing solutions into customer product lines has proven tremendously effective in building relationships with customers and suppliers alike that endure over time, generating regular repeat business and builds a reputation for customer service that provides a strong competitive advantage when pursuing new customers.
 
We also face competition from current and prospective customers who may decide to design and manufacture power electronics, communications components and electronic solutions needed to satisfy their internal programmatic requirements.
 
Consolidation in the defense technology solutions market, including through mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances among major entities to which we sell our products, has the potential to intensify the competitive pressures that we face. Many of our existing and potential competitors may be better positioned than we are to acquire other companies, technologies or products. We believe we compete favorably on the basis of multiple factors, including product quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service, past performance, design flexibility and ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions customized to our customers’ needs, and cost-effectiveness. Focusing on bespoke technology offerings with relatively low volumes and high margins enables our operating subsidiaries to compete favorably on price against larger companies with much high indirect cost structures. Finally, the fragmentation of the defense technology market also creates opportunities the Gresham Worldwide to grow through acquiring competitors and/or potential competitors.
 
Raw Materials
 
The raw materials for power supplies principally consist of electronic components. These raw materials are available from a variety of sources, and thus we are not dependent on any one supplier. We generally allow our subcontractors to purchase components based on orders received or forecasts to minimize our risk of unusable inventory. To the extent necessary, we may allow them to procure materials prior to orders received to obtain shorter lead times and to achieve quantity discounts following a risk assessment. In addition, we have decided to directly procure certain long lead-time electronic components in an effort to reduce our lead-time.
 
Many raw material vendors have reduced capacities, closed production lines and, in some cases, discontinued operations. As a result, some materials are no longer available to support some of our products requiring us to search for cross materials or, in certain circumstances, redesign some of our products to conform to currently available materials.


Intellectual Property
 
We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, industry expertise, confidential procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We believe that because our products are continually updated and revised, obtaining patents would be costly and not beneficial. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors as well as nondisclosure agreements with our suppliers and strategic partners in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. However, in the future, as we continue to develop unique core technology, we may seek to obtain patents for some of the core technology. On July 10, 2012, our trademark, “DP Digital Power Flexible Power” was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
In conjunction with our majority acquisition of Microphase, we concluded that because of the industry recognition of the Microphase trademark and trade name, which has been around for nearly 60 years, the tradename and trademark represented a significant intellectual property asset.
 
Microphase and Enertec typically design custom products to our customer specifications as “work for hire” and therefore own no intellectual property in the design. As the ultimate end user, the U.S. DoD and the Israeli MOD typically acquire and retain rights in all such technical data. Microphase does acquire and own intellectual property in the fabrication, assembly, tuning and testing protocols followed the production of the products. And, as they conduct more independent research and development to new technology solutions, both companies plan to file for patents to protect their intellectual property.

In the UK, Gresham Power typically will retain ownership of the intellectual property of the designs of products developed for defense applications. However, neither Relec nor Gresham Power typically retains intellectual property in any of the standard power products that they sell on the commercial market.
 
Compliance with Material Government (Not Just Environmental) Regulations
 
Coolisys
 
Coolisys’ businesses are heavily regulated in most of its markets. Coolisys handles power electronics products mainly in the form of power conversion. Coolisys must take into account several standards for electronic safety to protect the health of humans and animals. Coolisys serves diverse markets including automotive, defense/aerospace, medical/healthcare, industrial and telecommunications, each of which has its own set of their safety regulations and standard that Coolisys must comply with.
Government Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of Coolisys’ government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of Coolisys’ U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, Coolisys would generally be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of Coolisys’ government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require Coolisys to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold Coolisys liable for damages resulting from the default.
 
Medical device power supplies. Coolisys’ medical power supplies must incorporate one or more means of protection (“MOP”) to avoid electrocution. A MOP can be safety insulation, a protective earth, a defined creepage distance, an air gap (clearance) or other protective impedance. These can be used in various combinations - having two MOPs means if one fails, there is another in place. A MOP can be achieved through safety insulation, protective earth, a defined creepage distance, an air gap, other protective impedances, or by implementing a combination of these techniques. Coolisys must comply with a standard that treats operators and patients, resulting in the classifications “means of operator protection” and “means of patient protection.” The latter requirements are more stringent because the patient may be physically connected via an AP and unconscious when the fault occurs.
 
Environmental. Coolisys is subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. Coolisys continually assesses its compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure that its operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of Coolisys’ operations.


Non-U.S. Sales. Coolisys’ non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
 
Gresham
 
Gresham’s businesses are heavily regulated in most of its markets. Gresham transacts with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to the Department of Defense, branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exercise similar regulatory oversight in Gresham’s non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts. The governments of the U.S., UK and Israel may terminate any of Gresham’s applicable operating subsidiaries’ government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If the U.S. Government terminated any of Gresham’s contracts for convenience, Gresham generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of Gresham’s government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require Gresham to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold Gresham liable for damages resulting from the default. Similar provisions apply to Gresham’s contracts with other governments and to Gresham’s subcontractors with major defense contractors who provide systems or military platforms directly to the government.

Power Electronics. In all of Gresham’s markets in the U.S., Gresham’s commercial power electronics offerings must comply with safety, energy use and operational performance regulations and standards (IEC/EN/UL/CSA) issued and administered by international standards organizations. In the U.S., the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Communications Commission mandate and enforce compliance with these standards. Outside the U.S., various government agencies in the UK, Europe and Israel mandate and enforce compliance with these international requirements for safety, energy use and operational performance. In commercial markets, Gresham’s suppliers bear most of the expense of compliance with international standards as a standard cost of business. Given the universal application of these requirements, the costs of compliance do not create any competitive disadvantage because all competitors must comply to sell into the market.
 
Environmental. Gresham must meet applicable regulatory, environmental, emissions, safety and other requirements where its customer specifies or as applicable local regulations or laws require. The products that Gresham markets and sells in Europe also may be subject to the 2003 European Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), which restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of certain electronic and electrical equipment, as well as the 2002 European Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”), which determines collection, recycling and recovery goals for electrical goods. In July 2006, Gresham’s industry began phasing in RoHS and WEEE requirements in most geographical markets with specific emphasis on consumer-based products. Gresham believes that RoHS and WEEE-compliant components may be subject to longer lead-times and higher prices as the industry transitions to these new requirements. REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Registration) is a European Union regulation dating from 18 December 2006. REACH addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.
 
These regulatory mandates apply to all of Gresham’s operating subsidiaries. Gresham has structured operations to comply with these requirements and have experienced little to no impact on lead times or prices.

ACS is subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. ACS continually assesses compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. While ACS’s regulatory compliance costs are currently not considered material, it is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of ongoing monitoring.
Security Clearance
 
As a U.S. Government contractor, we are required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with the DoD and other Federal agency requirements.

Audits and Investigations
 
As a government contractor, we are subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government agencies including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the “DCAA”), the Defense Contract Management Agency (the “DCMA”), the Inspector General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. From time-to-time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether a contractor’s operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of, and compliance with, a contractor’s internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. Government. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government.
 
Enertec conducts operations under constant supervision of the Ministry of Defense of Israel and the contractors through which the MOD does most of its business. All of its contracts are subject to audits of performance, quality and price reasonableness.
 
Gresham Power contracts with UK Ministry of Defence, Royal Navy or major defense contractors serving those agencies include standard provisions which give the customer the right to audit our performance under those contracts when they see fit. Audits are part of doing business with the government and typically focus on deliveries – on time project milestones as well as quality. The Royal Navy will review Gresham Power pricing of services provided under support contract every 12 months for reasonableness.
 
The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, as implemented in standard contract clauses, mandates that Microphase establish and follow extensive detailed processes and protocols to protect classified and Confidential Unclassified Information (CUI) from disclosure and unauthorized access. That mandate includes a requirement that Microphase formulate and implement a System Security Plan with 110 different elements and protocols for handling and protecting classified information and CUI. Over the next 3 years, the DoD will require all participants in the defense supply chain to demonstrate compliance with the Capability Model Maturity Cybersecurity as verified through an independent third party auditor. Compliance with these mandates requires and will require Microphase to invest significant resources to maintain compliance. For instance, compliance requires extensive security controls on access to Microphase IT systems, strong firewalls and intrusion monitoring. Microphase will have to hire a full-time person to ensure information security and act as a Facility Security Officer as well as oversee security of all Microphase employees. These investments add to indirect cost pools that Microphase must recover in the price of its products for DoD and contractors.
 
Gresham Power Electronics Ltd is fully certified as “Cyber Essentials Compliant.” Cyber Essentials is a Government-backed, industry-supported scheme to help organizations protect themselves against common online threats. The UK Government requires all suppliers bidding for contracts involving the handling of sensitive and personal information to be certified against the Cyber Essentials program criteria.


Enertec has implemented the strongest possible cyber security protections consistent with the resources available to a company its size.

Human Capital Resources 
 
We are committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent, so investing in human capital is critical to our success. The employee traits we value include industriousness, intellectual curiosity, growth mindset and deeply caring about the quality of work. The human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business include employee safety, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
 
The following description provides an overall view of our Company. Since we are a holding company, however, every statement may not be applicable to every subsidiary, particularly since some are located in foreign countries and others operate in industries deemed essential by the DoD and therefore remained at work during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Employee Profile
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 154 employees located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel, of whom 54 were engaged in engineering and product development, 14 in sales and marketing, 46 in general operations and 40 in general administration and finance. All but 10 of these employees are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees is currently represented by a trade union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 36% of our current workforce is female, 64% male, and our average tenure is 10.0 years, an increase of 3.7% from an average tenure of 9.7 years as of December 31, 2019.
 
Talent
 
A core tenet of our talent system is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and commitment in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous improvement mindset and our goals of a diverse and inclusive workforce. We believe that our average tenure of ten years as of the end of the fiscal year 2020 reflects the engagement of our employees in this core talent system tenet.
 
The Company believes it complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.


Employee Engagement and Development
 
Our employee engagement efforts include our frequent and transparent “all-hands” meetings and executive communications, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase transparency. We believe in continual improvement and use employee feedback to drive and improve processes that support our customers and ensure a deep understanding of our employees' needs. We plan to conduct annual confidential employee surveys as we believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improves individual performance. Our employees will participate in a 360-degree evaluation process to identify critical capabilities for development and establish new stretch goals.
 
Objectives and key results are used to drive our business strategy. All our teams participate in an annual strategic planning process to identify objectives for business growth and innovation. Our teams and employees set goals quarterly to achieve the Company’s annual objectives.
 
Pay Equity
 
Our employee compensation strategy supports three primary objectives: attract and retain the best team members, reflect and reinforce our most important values and align team member interests with shareholder interests in building enduring value. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.

Total Rewards
 
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to healthy base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources and flexible work schedules. We anticipate establishing a Company-wide augmented employee stock purchase plan and a Company matched 401(k) plan during 2021.
Health and Safety
 
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having a significant portion of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
