Item 1—Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Costco operated 741, 715, and 686 warehouses worldwide at September 3, 2017, August 28, 2016, and August 30, 2015, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017. References to 2016 and 2015 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2016, and August 30, 2015, respectively.
General
We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available. 
We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to individual warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.

Item 1—Business (Continued)

Our average warehouse space is approximately 145,000 square feet, with newer units slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have inventory losses (shrinkage) well below those of typical retail operations.
Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit, including the Costco co-branded card, and debit cards, cash, and checks. 
Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,800 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:

• | Foods (including dry foods, packaged foods, and groceries)


• | Sundries (including snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)


• | Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)


• | Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)


• | Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)


• | Ancillary (including gas stations and pharmacy)

Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include our gas stations, pharmacy, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. We sell gasoline in all countries except Korea and France, with the number of warehouses with gas stations varying significantly by country. We operated 536, 508, and 472 gas stations at the end of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
Our online businesses, which include e-commerce, business delivery, and travel, vary by country. In the U.S. and Canada, we offer all of our online businesses. We operate e-commerce websites in all countries except Japan, Australia, Spain, Iceland, and France. Online businesses provide our members additional products and services, many not found in our warehouses. Net sales for our online business were approximately 4% of our total net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 3% in 2015.
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is significant.

Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.
Membership 
Our members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable evidence. Business members have the ability to add additional cardholders (add-ons). Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Effective June 1, 2017, we increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star (individual), Business and Business add-on by $5 to $60 per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $110 to $120 (annual membership fee of $60, plus Executive upgrade of $60), and the maximum annual 2% reward, which is earned on qualified purchases and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses, increased from $750 to $1,000. Our annual membership fees in our Other International operations vary by country. All paid memberships include a free household card. 
Our member renewal rate was 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 87% on a worldwide basis in 2017. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. 
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015
Gold Star | 38,600 | | 36,800 | | 34,000
Business, including add-ons | 10,800 | | 10,800 | | 10,600
Total paid members | 49,400 | | 47,600 | | 44,600
Household cards | 40,900 | | 39,100 | | 36,700
Total cardholders | 90,300 | | 86,700 | | 81,300

Paid cardholders (except Business add-ons) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the U.K. for an additional annual fee, which varies by country. Executive members have access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services (except in Mexico), such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by state and country. Executive members represented 38% of paid members at the end of 2017. Executive members generally spend more than other members, and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase.
Labor
Our employee count was as follows:

 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015
Full-time employees | 133,000 | | 126,000 | | 117,000
Part-time employees | 98,000 | | 92,000 | | 88,000 
Total employees | 231,000 | | 218,000 | | 205,000

Approximately 15,600 employees are union employees. We consider our employee relations to be very good.

Competition
Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with warehouse club operations (primarily Wal-Mart’s, Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and nearly every major U.S. and Mexico metropolitan area has multiple club operations.
Intellectual Property
We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale® trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality products, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items.
We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.
Available Information
Our U.S. internet website is www.costco.com. We make available through the Investor Relations section of that site, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with, or furnishing such documents to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The SEC also maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, such as the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
We have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Copies of the code are available free of charge by writing to Secretary, Costco Wholesale Corporation, 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah, WA 98027.
