ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
The Company
INDUS Realty Trust, Inc. (“INDUS” or the “Company”), formerly known as Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc., is an acquiror, developer and asset manager of industrial/logistics real estate in select supply-constrained and high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”). INDUS’s real estate holdings consist primarily of industrial/logistics properties, which accounted for 91.5% of its square footage as of November 30, 2020. INDUS also owns a limited number of office/flex properties, which accounted for 8.5% of its square footage, in addition to approximately 3,400 acres of undeveloped land as of November 30, 2020. For further information, see Part I, Item 2. “Properties” in this Annual Report. 
At November 30, 2020, INDUS’s industrial/logistics portfolio consisted of approximately 4.2 million aggregate rentable square feet across 30 buildings with a weighted average building age of 12 years. INDUS’s industrial/logistics portfolio is geographically located in the following markets by square footage: 49% in Hartford, CT; 31% in the Lehigh Valley, PA; 13% in Charlotte, NC; and 7% in Orlando, FL. As of November 30, 2020, INDUS’s office/flex portfolio consisted of approximately 0.4 million aggregate rentable square feet across 11 buildings. INDUS expects that its office/flex portfolio will continue to become a smaller percentage of its total square footage as it plans to focus on the growth of its industrial/logistics building portfolio either through the acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired, or both.
INDUS is a Maryland corporation and its corporate headquarters is located at 641 Lexington Avenue, 26th Floor in New York City, with another principal office located at 204 West Newberry Road in Bloomfield, Connecticut. 
INDUS’s website is www.indusrt.com. The information on INDUS’s website is not incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in, or otherwise a part of, this Annual Report. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investors section of INDUS’s website. INDUS’s common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol “INDT”.
Corporate Structure & History
INDUS traces its history as an independent, publicly-traded company back to 1997 when Culbro Corporation (“Culbro”) underwent a corporate reorganization such that each holder of Culbro’s common stock received one share of common stock of Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. (“GL&N”). GL&N was primarily engaged in developing, managing, and leasing industrial and commercial properties and it also operated a landscape nursery business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. (“Imperial”). In 2014, GL&N sold Imperial, and, in 2015, GL&N changed its name to Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc.
On December 30, 2020, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among INDUS, Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Griffin”), and Griffin Industrial Maryland, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of INDUS, the Company completed an internal merger (the “Merger”) to reincorporate from a Delaware corporation to a Maryland corporation. On December 31, 2020, following the Merger and reincorporation, Griffin changed its name from Griffin Industrial Realty, Inc. to INDUS Realty Trust, Inc. On January 4, 2021, INDUS announced that it intends to elect to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) under sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “REIT Conversion”). Provided INDUS qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes if it distributes 100% of its taxable income for each year to its stockholders. However, any taxable income from any taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a “TRS” and, collectively, "TRSs") will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. 

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “Company,” “Griffin,” “INDUS,” “we,” “our,” and “us” mean legacy Griffin, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger and INDUS Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries for periods following the Merger.

Competitive Strengths
INDUS believes that it is well-positioned in its industry and markets due to the quality of its portfolio and tenancy, in addition to its size, track record, and growth opportunities. Summarized below are what management believes to be INDUS’s competitive strengths:

● | High-Quality Industrial/Logistics Portfolio and Tenancy. INDUS’s portfolio primarily consists of modern, mid-sized industrial/logistics facilities in supply-constrained and/or high barrier-to-entry markets. INDUS’s properties are designed to meet multiple demand drivers for warehousing needs including local, regional and/or national distribution. The majority of INDUS’s properties are readily divisible to provide a variety of re-tenanting opportunities, do not have specialized building footprints or exterior features and are relatively young, with a weighted average year built of 2008. The leases to INDUS’s industrial/logistics properties have a weighted average lease term of 4.9 years. As of November 30, 2020, more than 70% of INDUS’s industrial/logistics square footage is leased to tenants that either are, or are a subsidiary of a company that is, publicly traded on a national stock exchange or have annual revenues over $500 million.

● | Well-Positioned in the Right Sector. Industrial has been one of the most resilient real estate sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic and demand in the sector has been supported by several trends, including the overall growth in the U.S. economy (even taking into account the economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic), increases in population and the optimization of supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic, in fact, has accelerated certain trends, including, but not limited to, continued growth and expansion in e-commerce, the necessity of safety inventories to avoid future supply shortages and the potential for re-shoring of manufacturing operations in certain industries. INDUS’s management believes that the relatively small size of its portfolio within a large market provides a significant opportunity for growth as additional developments and/or acquisitions can have a material impact on INDUS’s overall financial results.

● | Developer’s Mindset. INDUS’s construction and development team has developed over 80% of the industrial/logistics square footage added to its portfolio since 2005. INDUS’s development expertise informs management’s understating of the economics of renovations, maintenance costs and tenant improvements as well as how to price prospective acquisitions vis-à-vis replacement costs. INDUS’s development mindset helps management understand the barriers to new development that may influence future pricing and demand for properties as well as allowing management to evaluate and pursue a broad range of industrial/logistics investment opportunities ranging from land for development, to vacant or partially leased value-add investments, to stabilized, core acquisitions. Historically, INDUS has developed properties both on speculation and as build-to-suits for select tenants.

● | Disciplined and Proven Investment Strategy with an Experienced Team. INDUS has a team of experienced professionals working to maximize opportunities that align with its focused investment strategy. INDUS has strategically identified, evaluated and entered new geographic regions through the initial acquisition of land for development and/or buildings that formed the basis for what would become a larger portfolio of properties within that market. INDUS believes that its team’s knowledge of the markets in which INDUS operates and its relationships with key market participants, including land and property owners, brokers, and tenants, are important elements to INDUS’s success and future growth. Additionally, INDUS is focused on active leasing and management, maintaining strong tenant relationships, controlling operating expenses and physically maintaining the quality of its properties to drive increased profitability.

● | Significant Internal Growth Opportunities. INDUS expects to continue to generate internal growth, or increases in cash flows from its existing properties, through annual lease escalations, rent growth in the markets in which it operates, the burn off of rent abatements from new lease agreements, and the stabilization of vacancy in its new developments and acquisitions. INDUS also expects to leverage its existing platform and, as part of that, its current general and administrative costs as the Company seeks to own and manage a greater number of properties over time.

Management Objectives & Strategy
INDUS’s management objectives and investment strategies seek to maximize long-term growth in cash flows, net asset value and total stockholder return. In its pursuit of these objectives, the Company plans to:

● | Concentrate on a Limited Number of High-Potential Markets. INDUS intends to expand strategically and selectively into new geographic markets as it increases its presence from the four markets in which it operates today. INDUS seeks markets and/or submarkets that are supply-constrained or present significant barriers to entry and have a large and/or quickly growing population base and strong transportation infrastructure – whether that be roads, airports, rail or port access. Additionally, the market and/or submarket should be positioned to allow for a diversity of tenant uses that can service multiple drivers of demand in the modern supply chain, including local, regional and/or national distribution. Lastly, management seeks to enter markets where it can acquire or develop several properties and achieve a critical mass. INDUS believes that markets that meet its criteria have the potential for above average rent growth and occupancy over time and that owning several properties in a region may lead to prospective deals and opportunities as well as efficiencies for asset management.

● | Focus on Mid-Sized Industrial/Logistics Properties. INDUS seeks opportunities for acquisitions and developments of mid-sized industrial/logistics buildings, generally between 75,000 and 400,000 square feet. The Company believes that buildings of this size are less management intensive and attract larger companies as tenants than buildings below the target size range. The Company also believes that mid-sized buildings avoid the outsized exposure to any individual building or tenant that larger buildings may create within a portfolio. Within the mid-sized property range, INDUS seeks buildings that are generally suitable for one to three tenants and that have market-appropriate features that it believes will appeal to the widest variety of tenants in the market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Monetize Non-Core Assets and Recycle Capital. INDUS selectively seeks to monetize its office/flex and land holdings (especially where not suitable for industrial property development), or non-core assets, and redeploy the proceeds into industrial/logistics acquisition and development opportunities over time. Since 2012, INDUS has sold nearly $50 million of these non-core assets, mostly consisting of undeveloped land, and has invested those proceeds into its industrial/logistics portfolio – notably into several land sites that INDUS has entitled and developed or plans to develop, as well as into the first warehouse it purchased in Charlotte, North Carolina. During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”), INDUS sold one office/flex property for gross proceeds of $1.4 million, in addition to approximately 46 acres of undeveloped land and a small easement for gross proceeds of approximately $1.9 million, before transaction costs. As of February 10, 2021, INDUS had approximately 662 acres of land under agreement for sale for total anticipated gross proceeds of $17.6 million.

● | Pursue a Mix of New Developments and Acquisitions. To create value and enhance the quality of its portfolio, INDUS expects to continue to develop and acquire mid-sized industrial/logistics buildings in its target markets and preferred mid-sized range. INDUS believes that there are benefits to growing its property portfolio through both ground-up development and acquisitions of existing buildings, including the potential to receive rent from the acquisition of completed or occupied buildings sooner as compared to a land purchase and subsequent development, which management believes may achieve higher overall investment returns but over a longer-dated time horizon as compared to acquisitions of existing buildings. Additionally, INDUS believes owning and developing properties better informs management regarding the particular market’s dynamics and may lead to better sourcing of acquisition opportunities. INDUS seeks to design and own industrial/logistics properties that have market-appropriate clear heights, building depths and trailer parking and are located near the most critical market infrastructure. INDUS targets opportunities that meet its asset, location and financial criteria at prices and projected returns that it believes are attractive.

● | Conservatively Manage Balance Sheet and Utilize Equity to Enhance Stockholder Value. Prior to fiscal 2020, INDUS financed all of its external growth through internally-generated cash flows and property-level mortgage financings. INDUS intends to fund future growth with more equity capital than it has historically utilized, increase the percentage of unencumbered assets in its portfolio as the Company grows and lower its debt ratios over time. INDUS’s outstanding debt of approximately $163.2 million as of November 30, 2020 had a weighted average interest rate of 4.18% and consisted of property-level nonrecourse mortgage loans that have

regular principal amortization. INDUS believes that its asset-level financing is within a conservative range for a company of its size. INDUS believes that the potential future issuance of equity capital may allow for a broader stockholder base, improve liquidity for the Company’s current and future stockholders and provide INDUS with access to capital in larger quantities than previously available to support the Company’s growth. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Matters
INDUS believes that protecting the environment and supporting the communities in which its team lives and works are important measures of corporate responsibility. INDUS strives to support sustainability through its commitment to building environmentally responsible properties. Nearly 100% of its industrial/logistics properties feature energy efficient lighting, of which 54% have LED lighting. INDUS has also made the commitment to incorporate energy efficient features in its developments and, since 2012, 100% of its new developments have clerestory windows and all of INDUS’s properties in warm weather states like Florida and North Carolina have white reflective roof decks. Going forward, INDUS will seek ways to implement environmentally conscious decisions in the development and management of its industrial/logistics portfolio to create long-term value for the environment, the Company and stockholders.
Over the years, INDUS has participated in various charitable service organizations in its local business communities as part of its commitment to social responsibility. INDUS is also committed to socially-responsible policies and practices to attract and develop a diverse company culture, including a comprehensive employee benefits program and a commitment to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
INDUS relies on its Board of Directors (the “Board”) and management team to maintain the trust of its employees, stockholders, tenants and partners. INDUS believes the integrity of its leadership is evidenced through good corporate governance policies that are developed to align with the best interests of stockholders.
Employees
As of November 30, 2020, INDUS had 33 employees, including 32 full-time employees. Presently, none of INDUS’s employees are represented by a union. INDUS believes that relations with its employees are satisfactory, and seeks to promote a culture that is based on integrity, an entrepreneurial spirit and collaboration. INDUS relies on its employee relationships to support the Company’s vision and growth and believes that the strength of these relationships is evidenced by its low turnover and employee tenure, which, as of November 30, 2020, was over 14 years for INDUS’s corporate staff (which excludes maintenance and landscaping employees). Additionally, INDUS seeks to attract and develop a diverse company culture and female employees comprised 50% of its corporate staff as of November 30, 2020.
Competition
The market for leasing industrial/logistics space and office/flex space is highly competitive. INDUS competes for tenants with owners of numerous properties in the areas where its buildings are located. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than INDUS. INDUS’s real estate business competes on the bases of location, price, availability of space, convenience and amenities.
There is a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/logistics buildings and for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings. INDUS competes for the acquisition of industrial/logistics properties with REITs, institutional investors, such as pension funds, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts and public and private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than INDUS, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants or the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages such as a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity. 
Government Regulations
Environmental Matters
Under various federal and state laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and

may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to remediate properly such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real estate properties, INDUS may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other related costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. The value of INDUS’s land may be affected by the presence of residual chemicals from the prior use of the land for farming, principally on a portion of the land that is intended for residential use. In the event that INDUS is unable to remediate adequately any of its land intended for residential use, its ability to develop or sell the land for its intended purposes would be materially affected.
INDUS periodically reviews its properties for the purpose of evaluating such properties’ compliance with applicable federal and state environmental laws. At this time, management does not anticipate experiencing, in the next twelve months, any material expense in complying with such laws on any of its properties. INDUS may incur remediation costs in the future in connection with its development operations. Such costs are not expected to be significant as compared to expected proceeds from development projects or sales of real estate assets.
Americans with Disabilities Act and Fire, Safety and Other Land Use Regulations
All of INDUS’s properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended ("ADA"). The ADA generally requires that places of public accommodation comply with federal requirements related to access and use by people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements may be costly and could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government and/or an award of damages to private litigants. In addition, INDUS is required to operate its properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and applicable to INDUS’s properties, which may require capital expenditures.
Local Zoning Ordinances, Wetlands Restrictions, Storm Water Regulations and Open Space Preservation
INDUS’s operations are subject to various governmental regulations that affect its real estate development activities, such as local zoning ordinances, wetlands restrictions, storm water regulations, open space preservation initiatives, traffic considerations, and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies.
