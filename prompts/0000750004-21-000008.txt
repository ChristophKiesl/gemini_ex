ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise indicates, all references to the words “Scientific Games,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to SGC and its consolidated subsidiaries.
General
SGC was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. On September 18, 2017, SGC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SG Nevada Merger Company, a Nevada corporation and SGC’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Newco”), providing for the merger of SGC with and into Newco with Newco surviving the merger (the “Surviving Corporation”), for the sole purpose of changing SGC’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada (the “reincorporation merger”). The reincorporation merger was approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Class A common stock of SGC entitled to vote thereon at a special meeting of SGC’s stockholders on November 27, 2017. On January 10, 2018, the reincorporation merger was consummated. Following the consummation of the reincorporation merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock of SGC, par value $0.01 per share, automatically converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $.001 per share. The reincorporation merger did not result in any change in SGC’s name, headquarters, business, management, location of offices, assets, liabilities or net worth, other than as a result of the costs incident to the reincorporation merger. Our management, including all directors and officers, immediately prior to the reincorporation merger remained the same immediately following the reincorporation merger and assumed identical positions with the Surviving Corporation.
We are a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the worldwide gaming, lottery, social and digital gaming industries. Our portfolio of revenue-generating activities primarily includes supplying gaming machines and game content, CMSs and table game products and services to licensed gaming entities; providing instant and draw-based lottery products, lottery systems and lottery content and services to lottery operators; providing social casino and other mobile games to retail customers; and providing a comprehensive suite of digital RMG and sports wagering solutions, distribution platforms, content, products and services. We also gain access to technologies and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments. We report our results of operations in four business segments—Gaming, Lottery, SciPlay and Digital—representing our different products and services. 
Strategy
We strive to provide high quality products and services to our customers across all four of our business segments—Gaming, Lottery, SciPlay and Digital. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and as more fully described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview”, we reconstituted our board of directors. The reconstituted board of directors has commenced comprehensive review, evaluation and establishment of enhanced strategic and business plans.
To those ends, we are focused on the following strategies:
•Focus on accelerating de-leveraging and improving cash flow from operations — We are actively evaluating all strategic options to accelerate de-leveraging, strengthen our balance sheet and maximize stockholder value. This focus encompasses broad evaluation of our business and product portfolio, current and new markets, prudent fiscal management, working capital management, integrated business planning, and optimization of our supply chain.
•Strengthening a corporate culture and high performance organization— We are creating a culture of high performance organization by building a strong and diverse global team that cultivates open minds and focuses on driving innovation and enabling an efficient and flexible operation that is structured to support our business strategies.
•Drive innovation — We place great emphasis on producing innovative and high-performing Gaming, Lottery, SciPlay and Digital content, products and services that provide differentiated value to our customers. We seek to leverage our expansive content library and portfolio of proprietary and licensed intellectual property, and use our extensive player and customer research in order to bring innovation to our products, services and processes.

Gaming Segment
The gaming industry is characterized by the continuous development of new technologies, products and game content. Gaming products and services are used by a diverse group of gaming operators and U.S. and international lotteries which may offer VLTs and other forms of gaming, such as bingo and sports wagering.
Our products are installed in all of the major regulated U.S. gaming jurisdictions, and in approximately 188 international gaming jurisdictions. Growth of gaming in land-based venues is driven by the opening of new casinos in both new and existing jurisdictions and the expansion of existing casinos. In addition, the land-based gaming supply business is 
significantly impacted by the rate at which casinos and other gaming operators replace their gaming machines, which depends on a number of factors, including their capital budgets. Virtually all sectors of the gaming industry are impacted by changes in economic conditions that impact players’ disposable incomes.
A substantial portion of our U.K. gaming business benefits from a contract with the large U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral Group (which was acquired by Entain (formerly GVC Holdings PLC) in March 2018), which represents a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business. 
Competition 
The gaming machine sector is highly competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new games, gaming machines and related technologies. We compete primarily with Ainsworth Game Technology, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., (“Aristocrat”), Aruze Gaming America, Inc., Everi Games, Inc., International Game Technology (“IGT”) (a subsidiary of International Game Technology PLC), Inspired Entertainment Inc., Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. (“Konami”), the Novomatic Group of Companies and PlayAGS, Inc. (“AGS”). Our principal direct competitor in our U.K. LBO business is Inspired Entertainment Inc.
The CMS business is also highly competitive. Product features and functionality, accuracy, reliability, service level and pricing are among the factors that determine how successful systems providers are in selling their systems. Our principal competitors in CMSs include Aristocrat, IGT and Konami. Competition for these products is intense due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate.
With respect to our table products, we compete on the basis of the breadth of our Shuffler products and services and PTGs, product reliability, service, the strength of our intellectual property and our extensive sales, regulatory and distribution channels. 
Our automated Shufflers also compete against hand shuffling, which remains the most competitive shuffling option for casino card games around the world. Finally, since the need for our Shuffler products depends upon the casino’s use of live table games, our Shufflers also compete against any products that live table games compete against.
Competition for PTG content is based on player appeal, brand recognition, price and the strength of the underlying intellectual property. We compete on this basis, and on the strength of our extensive sales, service, marketing and distribution channels. We also compete with non-PTGs such as blackjack and baccarat, and several companies that primarily develop and license PTGs such as AGS, Galaxy Gaming, Inc. and Masque Publishing, Inc. Finally, some of our product lines may compete against each other for space on the casino floor.
Lottery Segment
There are approximately 180 lotteries throughout the world, operated by U.S. and international governmental authorities and their licensees. Governments typically authorize lotteries as a means of generating revenues without imposing additional taxes. Many jurisdictions have come to rely on the proceeds from lottery game sales as a significant source of funding for programs for which net lottery proceeds are designed to fund. Although there are many types of lottery games worldwide, the two principal categories of products offered are draw lottery games and instant lottery products sold both at retail and through internet (iLottery). Currently, 48 U.S. jurisdictions offer instant product lotteries and/or draw lotteries. Lottery operations in international jurisdictions can vary widely depending on the number of new lotteries entering the market, the number of lottery licenses issued within each market and the discontinuance of lotteries and operating licenses.
An instant lottery product is typically played by removing a scratch-off protective coating from a preprinted ticket to reveal if it is a winner. Draw lottery games, such as POWERBALL® and MEGA MILLIONS®, are based on a random selection of a series of numbers, and prizes are generally based on the number of winners who share the prize pool, although set prizes are also offered. Draw lottery games are generally provided through a lottery system in which lottery terminals in retail outlets are continuously connected to a central computer system for the sale and validation of lottery games and related functions. A lottery system may also be used to activate, sell and validate instant lottery products to confirm that a ticket is a winner and prevent duplicate payments. In some jurisdictions, separate instant game validation systems may be installed. Digital versions of these games are also available in many global jurisdictions and sold through mobile/internet systems referred to as iLottery.
Lotteries may offer a range of other games including sports betting, high-frequency monitor games and casino-style games via retail and internet. In the U.S., a number of lotteries offer these high frequency monitor games such as keno, which is typically played every four to five minutes in restricted social settings, such as bars, and is usually offered as an extension of the lottery system. 
The table below lists our more significant Lottery contracts as of December 31, 2020, representing approximately 31% of our Lottery revenue. Also included are instant or draw lottery game retail sales (as applicable), if publicly available, for each jurisdiction.

(1) Our lottery contracts with U.S. state governmental authorities generally contain termination for convenience clauses, which may be exercised at the election of the state government.

Competition 
The instant lottery products market segment is highly competitive and continues to be subject to intense price-based competition. Our principal instant products competitors in the U.S. are IGT and Pollard Banknote Limited. Internationally, a number of instant lottery product vendors compete with us including the competitors noted above and diversified printers in India, China and Latin America. Our principal competitors in the supply of lottery-related licensed games, promotional entertainment and loyalty or rewards programs are Alchemy3 LLC, IGT, Intralot S.A. and Pollard Banknote Limited.
The lottery systems business is also highly competitive and continues to be subject to intense price-based competition. Our principal competitors in this business are IGT and Intralot S.A. We also compete with various suppliers of lottery system components, such as terminals and computer systems, and lottery operators that internally develop their own systems.
As certain countries liberalize gaming regulations, lotteries may expand their scope by offering sports wagering, gaming machines, interactive gaming or other forms of gaming, which may introduce new suppliers that compete with us for lottery customers. In some jurisdictions, the liberalization of gaming regulations has included the privatization or outsourcing of all or a portion of the lottery operations via a competitive bidding process to a lottery operator or a license holder. We believe Camelot Group plc, IGT, Intralot, S.A. and the Sazka Group to be among those competitors operators who may also bid on such opportunities. These operators in most cases are customers we serve as a supplier and could also be partners or competitors when we participate as an operator.
SciPlay Segment
Our SciPlay business segment is a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web platforms. SciPlay operates in the social gaming market, which is characterized by gameplay online, on mobile phones or on tablets that are social and competitive, and self-directed in pace and session length. Our SciPlay business segment includes social gaming where we generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of virtual coins, chips or bingo cards (“coins, chips and cards”), which players can use to play slot games, table games or bingo games. Once obtained, coins, chips and cards (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other than game play within our apps. SciPlay currently offers seven core games, including social casino games Jackpot Party® Casino, Gold Fish® Casino, Hot Shot Casino® and Quick Hit® Slots, and casual games MONOPOLY Slots, Bingo Showdown®, 88 Fortunes® Slots, and recently added a solitaire social game targeted toward casual game players as a part of the Come2Play acquisition on various platforms referenced herein. See Note 9 for further information regarding the Come2Play acquisition. SciPlay’s social casino games typically include slots-style game play and occasionally include table games-style game play, while SciPlay’s casual games blend slots-style or bingo game play with adventure game features. All of SciPlay’s games are offered and played across multiple platforms, including Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, with some games available on Microsoft and other web and mobile platforms. In addition to SciPlay’s internally created game content, SciPlay’s content library includes recognizable, real-world slot and table games content from Scientific Games. This content allows players who like playing land-based slot machines to enjoy some of those same titles in our free-to-play games. SciPlay has access to Scientific Games' library of more than 1,500 iconic casino titles, including titles and content from third-party licensed brands such as MONOPOLY™, JAMES BOND™, THE FLINTSTONES™, MICHAEL JACKSON™, and PLAYBOY™. SciPlay’s access to this content, coupled with our years of experience developing in-house content, uniquely positions SciPlay to create compelling social games.
A number of trends and opportunities are driving significant changes in digital gaming, which we believe are causing growth in the casual games market and providing opportunities for SciPlay to grow our social casino games and expand into other areas of the casual games market, such as:
•Digital gaming is an engaging form of entertainment;
•Mobile devices are a leading medium to consume content such as games;
•Increasing number of players with the emergence of casual games;
•Scale is increasingly strategic in order to succeed in mobile gaming;
•Social casino gaming is an attractive market within digital gaming; and
•Additional market opportunities within the broader mobile gaming landscape.
Competition
Our SciPlay business segment faces significant competition in all aspects of its business. SciPlay’s primary social casino game competitors include Playtika, Product Madness/Big Fish Games (subsidiaries of Aristocrat), Zynga Inc., DoubleU Games/Double Down Interactive, GSN/Bash Gaming and Huuuge Games. SciPlay’s competitors in the broader social game market include Glu Mobile, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Kabam, Rovio and Tencent Holdings. On the broadest scale, SciPlay competes for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of players versus other forms of online entertainment, including social media, reading and other video games on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.
Digital Segment
Our Digital business segment provides highly customizable software design, development, licensing, maintenance and support services from a comprehensive suite of technology solutions. Our interactive casino solutions allow interactive casino operators to utilize our distribution platform, including full gaming process support services, brand and player management services, and iLottery and RMG offerings through our remote gaming servers. Our sports betting services enable our customers to operate sports books, including betting markets across both fixed-odds and pari-mutuel betting styles, a distribution platform, full gaming process support services, and brand and player management. 
Competition
In our Digital gaming business, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers with other digital gaming entertainment companies that offer real-money digital casino games and sports wagering services and/or platforms. Our primary real-money digital casino games competitors include IGT, Microgaming Software Systems Ltd., Evolution Gaming, and Playtech Limited. Our primary competitors in sports wagering platform solutions are other “first-party” solutions, IGT, and Kambi.
Research and Development 
We believe our ability to attract new Gaming, Lottery, SciPlay and Digital customers and retain existing customers depends in part on our ability to evolve and continue to develop our product lines and service offerings by continually developing differentiating products, hardware and systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and customer profitability. We are also focused on expanding use of the internet, mobile phones and other interactive technologies to increase play. Our gaming machines are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff, and our game content is designed primarily by internal game development studios who consider market trends and customer feedback. 
We have Gaming R&D personnel located in our Las Vegas, Nevada and Chicago, Illinois facilities. A large portion of our Lottery R&D team is based in our Alpharetta, Georgia facilities. We have SciPlay personnel located primarily in Austin, Texas; Cedar Falls, Iowa; and Tel Aviv, Israel. We have Digital R&D personnel based primarily in the United Kingdom, Greece and India. We also have game development studios in Las Vegas; Sydney, Australia; Manchester, England; and India (including Bangalore, Chennai and Pune), with additional R&D staff in other locations, including Reno, Nevada and Vienna, Austria. 
Intellectual Property
Many of our products use intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We protect our investment in R&D by seeking intellectual property protection as appropriate for our technologies and content. We also acquire and license intellectual property from third parties.
The terms of our patents vary based on the type of patent and the date and jurisdiction of filing or grant. The term of U.S. design patents expires 15 years from the date of grant, and the term of utility patents generally expires 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional patent application in a family of patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country. 
Certain technologies, which are material to our businesses, are the subject of patents issued and patent applications currently pending in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our Lottery business uses our patented and patent-pending technologies in the production, secure printing, validation and distribution of instant lottery products. Our Gaming, SciPlay and Digital businesses use our patented and patent-pending technologies in games and associated platforms and systems. In addition, under a patent cross-licensing agreement with IGT, we can offer games using patented game features from the patent portfolios of other members of IGT’s slot game features program.
We market many of our products under trademarks and copyrights that provide product differentiation and recognition and promote our portfolio of product offerings. All of our games feature elements that are subject to copyright rights and protection. In addition, we generally obtain trademark protection and often seek to register trademarks for the names and designs under which we market and license our products and games. Protections for trademarks exist in many countries, including the U.S., for as long as the trademark is registered and/or used. Registrations are generally issued for fixed, but renewable terms, although trademark rights may exist whether or not a mark is registered and the duration of the registrations varies by country.
We believe that our use of both our own and third-party licensed brand names and related intellectual property contributes to the appeal and success of our products, and that our future ability to license, acquire or develop new brand names is important to our continued success. Therefore, we continue to invest in the recognition of our brands and brands that we license. Certain of our games are based on popular brands licensed from third parties, such as Hasbro International, Inc., Fremantle Media North America, CBS Studios Inc., Warner Bros. Consumer Products Inc., Playboy Enterprises International, Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, EON Productions Limited, Danjaq LLC, MGM Interactive Inc., MGM Consumer Products, and Mattel Inc.
From time to time, we become aware of potential infringement of our intellectual property by competitors and other third parties and consider what action, if any, to take in that regard, including litigation where appropriate. We are also subject to threatened or actual intellectual property-related claims by third parties from time to time. See the risk factors captioned “Our business depends on the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information”, “We rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of third parties”, and “The intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products and services, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Production Processes, Sources and Availability of Components 
We currently produce substantially all of our gaming machines through a mix of our manufacturing facilities and contracted parties. We have finishing lines in Las Vegas; Sydney, Australia; Barcelona, Spain; Midrand, South Africa; and Manchester, England. These finishing lines allow for the completion and testing of our gaming machine assemblies from our facilities. We also refurbish used gaming machines primarily at our Las Vegas and Manchester facilities.
Manufacturing commitments are generally based on expected quarterly sales orders from customers. Due to uneven order flow from customers, component parts for gaming machines are purchased and assembled into partial products that are scheduled for just in time delivery to allow final assembly lead time to meet agreed customer delivery dates. Our gaming machine manufacturing processes generally consist of assembling component parts and sub-assemblies into a complete gaming machine. The level of completion and assembly varies by product platform and geographic region.
Shufflers are assembled in our Las Vegas facility and by third parties near Salzburg, Austria and Juarez, Mexico, which includes various levels of sub-assemblies with completion and testing at one of our finishing lines described above.
Hardware and component parts associated with our CMSs are purchased directly from the contract manufacturers and flow through our Las Vegas facilities with some assembly and testing. These parts do not require a significant amount of assembly and are used primarily in systems implementations, which take place at customer locations.    
Our dedicated computer-controlled printing process is specifically designed to produce secure instant lottery products. We also have the capability to track instant products from the point of production through delivery to retailers. Instant products are delivered finished and ready for distribution by the lottery authority (or by us under certain contracts). An instant product that has been removed at any point in the distribution chain in an unauthorized manner can be flagged and invalidated in the event that it is used to claim winnings. 
Production of our lottery terminals (and related component products) primarily involves the assembly of electronic and mechanical components into more complex systems and products. Third-party vendors generally manufacture and assemble our lottery terminals. We normally have sufficient lead time between reaching an agreement and the commencement of operations so that we are able to provide our Lottery customers with a fully functioning system that is customized to meet their 
requirements. We believe that this is consistent with our competitors’ lead times and is also consistent with the needs of our customers. 
We place advance orders for certain gaming and lottery components with long lead times based on projected customer demand.
We believe we have an adequate supply of component parts and raw materials used in manufacturing our gaming machines, shufflers, CMSs and lottery terminals. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer, while revenue from our Participation gaming machines is generally highest in the spring and summer. Player activity for SciPlay is generally slower in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months. Player activity for our Digital business, specifically digital casino operations, is generally slower in the third quarter during the summer months and is generally higher in the fourth quarter and varies based on seasons of different popular sports such as soccer, professional and collegiate football, and professional and collegiate basketball. Historical seasonality has been significantly impacted by COVID-19 business disruptions and could continue to be impacted in future periods, particularly for our Gaming business and sales of our gaming machines. See the risk factor captioned “Our results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Human Capital
We are a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the worldwide gaming, lottery, social and digital gaming industries. Our global reach is made possible through the expertise, skill and dedicated efforts of our employees who serve customers in more than 100 countries on 6 continents. 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 9,000 persons worldwide, with approximately 4,200 employed domestically and 4,800 employed internationally.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion are embedded in our core value of team spirit, by which we collaborate as one diverse and inclusive team with an upbeat, inventive passion for building great entertainment. In support of this core value, we have formulated a diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan and established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council and task force in 2020 to make key decisions, review progress, communicate results and identify areas that require further development. We have invested in analysis of our diversity, equity and inclusion data and continue to implement hiring, training, recruiting and retention initiatives across our workforce in line with our diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan. 
We are committed to creating an inclusive global gaming industry as a founding member of the All-In Diversity Project, a non-profit organization creating tools to advance the industry’s diversity, inclusion and workplace equality. As a founding member, we work collaboratively with additional partners to determine diversity, equity and inclusion expectations and standards for the gaming industry, while driving a conversation to establish global standards. 
We also help drive diversity across our industry by including minority, women, disabled, and/or veteran-owned businesses in our supply chain and by counting some small businesses and businesses in historically underutilized business zones among our suppliers. As one of the leading global suppliers of products and services to gaming operations and lotteries, we believe that diversity in our supplier base is good business. Our supplier diversity program encourages diverse businesses to provide materials and services that offer value and competitive pricing. We are proud to be a national corporate member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council.
Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority of our leaders. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented new work procedures that allow employees to work from home and collaborate remotely. We have also taken measures to keep our workforce safe by monitoring and reducing the impact of the outbreak, including putting in place a global crisis monitoring team, protocols for responding when employees are infected and enhanced cleaning procedures at all sites. 
Compensation and Benefits
Scientific Games provides a competitive and comprehensive benefits program that is aligned with our business objectives and attempts to inspire employees to drive innovation and improve Company performance. In addition to cash 
compensation, Scientific Games offers medical, dental and vision plans; employee stock purchase plans; paid time off and paid holidays; company-paid disability; life insurance; 401(k) plans; flexible spending accounts; and employee assistance programs. 
Government Regulation
General
Each of our business segments is generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation. For the Gaming and Lottery business segments, regulation customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of operators, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. Each of our business segments is subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet and over mobile networks, especially in relation to privacy and security. Furthermore, for the SciPlay business segment, there is also significant opposition in some jurisdictions to interactive social gaming, including social casino gaming. For our Digital business segment, although some states are expanding the availability of interactive gaming, there have also been various state and federal bills proposed recently in the U.S. to restrict or prohibit interactive gaming and lottery sales. Significant resources are being devoted to supporting these efforts. Although these efforts have generally not been successful, we cannot assure that laws restricting interactive gaming or lottery sales will not be passed at either the federal or state level.
While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
We have developed and implemented a rigorous internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our Gaming, Lottery, SciPlay and Digital activities, and legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. The compliance program is run on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Compliance Officer with legal advice provided by attorneys in our legal and compliance departments and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors, which is comprised of employee and non-employee directors and a non-employee gaming law expert. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws, we cannot assure that our compliance program will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses.
In the EU, various judgments by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) have addressed the approaches adopted by certain member states to restrict and/or regulate gaming. Topics addressed in those judgments include the ability of member states to grant, or to maintain, monopolies for gaming and lottery activities and the power of member states to limit access by gaming and/or lottery providers established elsewhere in the EU. Several cases on these subjects are currently pending in the CJEU. However, in December 2017, the European Commission dropped all enforcement actions related to gambling in an effort to change the way it enforces EU law, leaving compliance with EU laws to national courts. Notwithstanding this development, the European Commission adopted a decision in April 2018 requesting the European Committee for Standardization (a group of EU regulators and industry bodies) to draft a European standard on reporting in support of supervision of online gambling services.
While we believe that we have developed appropriate procedures and policies to comply with the requirements of these evolving laws and legal pronouncements, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of law enforcement proceedings or that any such proceedings would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business plans. Furthermore, laws and regulations applicable to lotteries and gaming in U.S. and international jurisdictions are subject to change and the effect of such changes on our ongoing and potential operations cannot be predicted with certainty.
From time to time, we retain government affairs representatives in various U.S. and international jurisdictions to advise elected and appointed officials and the public concerning our views on gaming and lottery-related legislation, and to monitor such legislation and to advise us in our relations with gaming and lottery authorities.
Gaming
We provide our games, gaming machines, gaming systems, table products and related products and services in legal gaming jurisdictions worldwide. The manufacture, distribution, provision and operation of our gaming products and services is 
subject to regulation and approval by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal and foreign agencies. The primary purposes of these rules are to (1) ensure the responsibility, financial stability and character of the parties involved in these activities through licensing and registration requirements, (2) ensure the integrity and compliance of our gaming products and services and (3) prohibit the use of gaming products and services at unauthorized locations or for the benefit of undesirable parties.
Typically, gaming regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and are administered by a regulatory agency with broad authority to interpret gaming regulations and to regulate gaming activities. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we are licensed:
•adopt additional rules and regulations under the implementing statutes; 
•investigate violations of gaming regulations; 
•enforce gaming regulations and impose disciplinary sanctions for violations of such laws, including fines, penalties and revocation of gaming licenses; 
•review the character and fitness of manufacturers, distributors and operators of gaming products and services and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure; 
•grant licenses for the manufacture, distribution and operation of gaming products and services; 
•review and approve transactions (such as acquisitions, material commercial transactions, securities offerings and debt transactions); and 
•establish and collect related fees and/or taxes.
We believe we hold all of the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our business. We are authorized to sell, lease or operate our gaming products and services in approximately 466 jurisdictions worldwide (including jurisdictions that do not require licensing), including approximately 188 international gaming jurisdictions.
In addition, a number of U.S. states authorize wagering on VLTs at state regulated and licensed facilities. Although some states restrict VLTs to already existing wagering facilities, others permit these machines to be placed at venues such as bars, restaurants, truck stops and other specifically licensed gaming facilities. In addition, all of the Canadian provinces and various other international jurisdictions have authorized VLTs.
Regulatory requirements vary among jurisdictions, but the majority of jurisdictions require licenses, permits or findings of suitability for our company, individual officers, directors, major stockholders and key employees. Our gaming hardware and software also must be approved either by a gaming authority laboratory or a private laboratory authorized by the gaming authority.
Lottery
Currently, 48 U.S. jurisdictions offer instant game lotteries and/or draw lotteries. The operation of lotteries in the U.S. and internationally is subject to extensive regulation. Although certain features of a lottery, such as the percentage of gross revenues that must be paid back to players in prize money, are usually set by legislation, lottery regulatory authorities generally exercise significant discretion, including with respect to the determination of the types of games played, the price of each wager, the manner in which the lottery is marketed and the selection of suppliers of equipment, technology and services and retailers of lottery products.
To ensure the integrity of contract awards and lottery operations, most jurisdictions require detailed background disclosure on a continuous basis from, and conduct background investigations of, vendors and their officers, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates and principal stockholders. Background investigations of the vendors’ employees who will be directly responsible for the operation of lottery systems are also generally conducted and most states reserve the right to require the removal of employees who they deem to be unsuitable or whose presence they believe may adversely affect the operational security or integrity of the lottery. Certain jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities that hold a specified percentage (typically five percent or more) of a vendor’s securities either legally, beneficially and/or through voting rights. The failure of such holders of our securities to submit to background checks and provide such disclosure could result in the imposition of penalties and could jeopardize the award of a lottery contract to us or provide grounds for termination of an existing lottery contract.
The award of lottery contracts and ongoing operations of lotteries in international jurisdictions are also extensively regulated, although international regulations typically vary from those prevailing in the U.S. Restrictions are frequently imposed on foreign companies seeking to do business in such jurisdictions and, as a consequence, we have in a number of instances allied ourselves with local companies when seeking international lottery contracts.
SciPlay
SciPlay is subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies operating online, including over the internet and mobile networks, many of which are still evolving and being interpreted. We are also subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer data. The scope of data privacy and security regulations continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely within the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
There is also significant opposition in some jurisdictions to interactive social gaming, including social casino gaming. Some states or countries have anti-gaming groups that specifically target social casino games. Such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory framework to govern interactive social gaming or social casino gaming specifically. These could result in a prohibition on interactive social gaming or social casino gaming altogether, restrict our ability to advertise our games, or substantially increase our costs to comply with these regulations. 
We continue to devote significant attention to monitoring these developments. However, we cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any state, federal or foreign regulations relating to SciPlay.
Digital
In the U.S., the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIGEA”) prohibits among other things, the acceptance by a business of a wager by means of the internet where such wager is prohibited by any federal or state law where initiated, received or otherwise made. Under UIGEA severe criminal and civil sanctions may be imposed on the owners and operators of such systems and on financial institutions that process wagering transactions. The law contains a safe harbor for wagers placed within a single state (disregarding intermediate routing of the transmission) where the method of placing the bet and receiving the bet is authorized by that state’s law, provided the underlying regulations establish appropriate age and location verification.
Until 2011, there was uncertainty as to whether the Federal Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) prohibited states from conducting intrastate lottery transactions via the internet if such transactions crossed state lines. In late 2011, the Office of Legal Counsel of the DOJ (the “OLC”) issued an opinion which concluded that the prohibitions of the Wire Act were limited to sports gambling and thus did not apply to state lotteries at all (the “2011 DOJ opinion”).
Following the issuance of the 2011 DOJ opinion, a number of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation to specifically authorize online poker, online gambling and sports wagering. On May 14, 2018 the Supreme Court of the U.S. overturned the PASPA, a decision that opened up a path to legalization of sports wagering across the country. Following this ruling, at least 25 states have legalized sports wagering, with some of those states permitting online sports wagering. Other states are considering legislation that would permit legal sports wagering, both land based and online. Additionally, six state lotteries offer (and other lotteries are considering offering) internet instant game sales to in-state lottery customers, and a number of other states allow subscription sales of draw games over the internet. Pennsylvania’s gaming expansion bill in October 2017, which authorized online casino and land based and online sports wagering, also authorized Pennsylvania’s lottery to distribute lottery products, including instant ticket games, through numerous channels including web applications, mobile applications, mobile web, tablets and social media.
In 2018, at the request of the Criminal Division, the OLC reconsidered the 2011 DOJ opinion’s conclusion that the Wire Act was limited to sports gambling. On January 14, 2019, the OLC published a legal opinion dated November 2, 2018 (the “2018 DOJ opinion”), which concluded that the 2011 DOJ opinion had incorrectly interpreted the Wire Act. In the 2018 DOJ opinion, the OLC concluded that the restrictions on the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets and wagers in the Wire Act were not limited to sports gambling but instead applied to all bets and wagers. These restrictions therefore apply equally to our iGaming, iLottery, and sports betting solutions and services. The OLC also found that the enactment of the UIGEA described above did not modify the scope of the Wire Act. The DOJ later issued memoranda directing federal law enforcement agencies to refrain from enforcing the conclusions of the 2018 DOJ opinion for activities other than sports betting until June 30, 2020. No official extension of the forbearance period has been announced. On January 20, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued an opinion that the Wire Act applies only to the interstate transmission of wire communications related to sports gambling and not to all bets and wagers. At this time, we are unable to determine whether the 2018 DOJ opinion will be upheld by other courts or what impact the 2018 DOJ opinion or the impact of any other challenge to the 2018 DOJ opinion will have on us or our customers. 
Although some states are expanding the availability of interactive gaming, there have also been various state and federal bills proposed recently in the U.S. to restrict or prohibit interactive gaming and lottery sales, and significant resources are being devoted to supporting these efforts. Although these efforts have generally not been successful, we cannot assure that laws restricting interactive gaming or lottery sales will not be passed at either the federal or state level. For instance, in May 
2015, the Minnesota legislature passed an amendment to the state’s lottery law prohibiting the sale of instant win lottery tickets over the internet. Furthermore, changes in the executive branches of government at the state and federal level could affect federal and state policies on gaming as well.
On December 19, 2019, the U.K. Government confirmed the proposed review of the Gambling Act 2005. The review started on December 8, 2020 with the publication of terms of reference and an initial 16 week call for evidence. To varying degrees, a number of European governments have taken steps to change the regulation of internet wagering (also known as online gambling) through the implementation of new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, with increasingly stringent requirements particularly on B2Cs in relation to responsible gambling and affordability checks. Also, some jurisdictions impose sanctions on unlicensed providers. Countries outside Europe and the U.S. have also begun evaluating interactive gaming regulation and an increase in regulated markets outside of the U.S. and Europe is likely to continue. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide internet wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to internet wagering in such countries.
We continue to devote significant attention to monitoring these developments. However, we cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any state, federal or foreign regulations relating to interactive gaming and lottery sales.
