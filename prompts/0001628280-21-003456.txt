ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “our company” and “the Company” refer to QTS Realty Trust, Inc. (“QTS”), a Maryland corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including QualityTech, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to in this Form 10-K as the “Operating Partnership” or “predecessor.”
Overview
QTS is a leading provider of data center solutions to the world’s largest and most sophisticated hyperscale technology companies, enterprises and government agencies. Through our technology-enabled platform, delivered across mega scale data center infrastructure, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of secure and compliant IT solutions. Our data centers are facilities that power and support our customers’ IT infrastructure equipment and provide seamless access and connectivity to a range of communications and IT services providers. Across our broad footprint of strategically located data centers, we provide flexible, scalable and secure IT solutions, including data center space, power and cooling, connectivity and value-add managed services for more than 1,200 customers in the financial services, healthcare, retail, government, technology and various other industries. We build out our data center facilities depending on the needs of our customers to accommodate both multi-tenant environments (hybrid colocation) and customers that require significant amounts of space and power (hyperscale), including federal customers. We believe that we own and operate one of the largest portfolios of multi-tenant data centers in the United States, as measured by gross square footage, and have the capacity to nearly double our sellable data center raised floor space without constructing or acquiring any new buildings. In addition, we own more than 785 acres of land that is available at our data center properties that provides us with the opportunity to significantly expand our capacity to further support future demand from current and new potential customers.
As of December 31, 2020, our data center portfolio consisted of 28 data centers located throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. Across our footprint, our data centers are concentrated in the markets which we believe offer the highest growth opportunities. Our data centers are highly specialized, mission-critical facilities utilized by our customers to store, power and cool the server, storage, and networking equipment that support their most critical business systems and processes. We believe that our data centers are best-in-class and engineered to adhere to the highest specifications commercially available to customers, providing fully redundant, high-density power and cooling sufficient to meet the needs of the largest companies and organizations in the world. We have demonstrated a strong operating track record of “five-nines” (99.999%) reliability since QTS’ inception.
The COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the United States and global economy and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets, however, as of December 31, 2020, these developments have not had a known material adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2020, each of our data centers in North America and Europe are fully operational and operating in accordance with our business continuity plans. Across each of the respective jurisdictions in which we operate, our business has been deemed an essential operation, which has allowed us to remain fully staffed with critical personnel in place to continue to provide service and support for our customers.
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our and our customers’ operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, new information that may emerge concerning the severity, variants or mutations of COVID-19, vaccine efficacy and rollout and other actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial performance, and results of operations and also may exacerbate many of the risks identified under the section entitled “Risk Factors”. For a further discussion of the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Item 1A Risk Factors.”
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2020, including 100% of the unconsolidated entity with which we are affiliated, we operated 28 data center properties located throughout the United States, Canada and Europe, containing an aggregate of approximately 7.8 
Table of Contents

million gross square feet of space, including approximately 3.5 million “basis-of-design” raised floor square feet (approximately 96.9% of which is wholly owned by us including our data center in Santa Clara which is subject to a long-term ground lease), which represents the total sellable data center raised floor potential of our existing data center facilities. This reflects the maximum amount of space in our existing buildings that could be leased following full build-out, depending on the space and power configuration that we deploy. As of December 31, 2020, this space included approximately 2.0 million raised floor operating net rentable square feet, or NRSF, plus approximately 1.6 million square feet of additional raised floor available for development, of which approximately 0.3 million raised floor square feet is expected to become operational by December 31, 2021. Of the total 1.6 million raised floor square feet available for development, approximately 0.2 million square feet was related to customer leases which had been executed as of December 31, 2020 but not yet commenced. Our facilities collectively have access to approximately 1,050 megawatts (“MW”) of available utility power. Access to power typically is the most limiting and expensive component in developing a data center and, as such, we believe our significant access to power represents an important competitive advantage.
We account for the operations of all our properties in one reporting segment.
Our Customer Base
Our data center facilities are designed with the flexibility to support a diverse set of solutions and customers. Our customer base is comprised of more than 1,200 different companies of all sizes representing an array of industries, each with unique and varied business models and needs. We serve Fortune 1000 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, including financial institutions, healthcare companies, retail companies, government agencies, communications service providers, software companies and global Internet companies.
We have customers that range from large enterprise and technology companies with significant IT expertise and data center requirements, including financial institutions, “Big Four” accounting firms and the world’s largest global Internet and cloud companies, to major healthcare, government agencies, telecommunications and software and web-based companies.
As a result of our diverse customer base, customer concentration in our portfolio is limited. As of December 31, 2020, only five of our more than 1,200 customers individually accounted for more than 3% of our monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”), with the largest customer accounting for approximately 13.1% of our MRR and the next largest customer accounting for only 5.4% of our MRR.
The majority of our MRR is generated from customers deployed in our U.S. data center locations. Customers deployed in our U.S. data center locations accounted for $38.0 million, $33.6 million and $31.0 million of total MRR as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and MRR from our international locations represented $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million of MRR as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our booked-not-billed MRR balance (which represents customer leases that have been executed, but for which lease payments have not commenced as of December 31, 2020) was approximately $12.9 million, or $154.4 million of annualized rent. As of December 31, 2019, our booked-not-billed MRR balance was approximately $7.8 million, or $93.1 million of annualized rent.
Our Structure
Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Our interest in the Operating Partnership entitles us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to our percentage ownership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we generally have the exclusive power under the Operating Partnership’s partnership agreement to manage and conduct the Operating Partnership’s business and affairs.

The following diagram depicts our ownership structure, on a non-diluted basis as of December 31, 2020.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we are uniquely positioned in the data center industry and distinguish ourselves from other data center providers through the following competitive strengths:
•Software-Defined Data Center Platform. QTS’ Service Delivery Platform (“SDP”) is a software-defined orchestration platform that empowers customers to interact with their data and QTS services by providing real-time visibility, access and dynamic control of critical metrics across hybrid environments from a single platform. Collectively, the ability to digitize, analyze and automate significant amounts of data through SDP enables customers to innovate, make better business decisions and maximize their outsourced IT investments both within QTS and across multiple integrated service providers.
•Platform Anchored by Strategically Located, Owned “Mega” Data Centers. Our larger “mega” data centers are located in Ashburn (DC-1 & DC-2), Atlanta (DC-1 & DC-2), Atlanta-Suwanee, Chicago, Fort Worth, Irving, Piscataway, Princeton, Richmond, Hillsboro and Manassas (including one facility which we contributed to an unconsolidated entity and a separate facility under development in Manassas that is 100% owned by us). Our facilities are constructed with the flexibility and capacity to support multi-tenant environments across a broad range of customer types, sizes and IT infrastructure requirements, which we believe delivers greater efficiency than single-use or smaller scale data centers. We believe that our data centers are engineered to among the highest specifications commercially available. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio of 28 data center properties (18 of which are wholly owned, representing 96.9% of our raised square feet, including our data center in Santa Clara which is subject to a long-term ground lease) provides the opportunity to significantly expand our sellable data 
Table of Contents

center raised floor capacity without constructing or acquiring any new buildings. In addition, we own approximately 785 acres of land at our existing data center properties that provides us with the opportunity to significantly expand our capacity to further support future demand from current and new potential customers.
•Substantial Data Center Development Expertise. We have gained substantial expertise in developing data center facilities through the acquisition and redevelopment and/or construction of our operating facilities. Our data center development strategy is primarily focused on “mega” scale facilities that allow for significant incremental growth opportunity, either through ground up development or redevelopment of existing data center powered shell footprint. Our data center development strategy allows us to rapidly scale our developments in a modular manner to coincide with customer demand, and drives higher efficiency into our model through increased operating and build cost leverage at scale. 
•Balanced Approach to Hyperscale and Hybrid Colocation Verticals. The scale of our facilities combined with our innovative SDP platform and world-class customer service capability, gives us the ability to meet the needs of a broad set of customers ranging from large hyperscale users to smaller enterprises and government agencies. We believe customers will continue to have evolving and diverse IT needs and will prefer providers that can offer the flexibility, scalability and technology solutions that de-risk their future IT journey. We believe our ability to provide solutions to a broad addressable market enhances our leasing velocity, diversifies our customer mix, results in more balanced lease terms and optimizes cash flows from our assets.
•Diversified, High-Quality Customer Base. As of December 31, 2020, our customer base consists of over 1,200 customers, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 13.1% of our MRR and no others greater than 5.4%. Only five of our customers exceeded 3% of our MRR. Our focus on premium customer service and our ability to grow with their IT needs allows us to achieve a low rental churn rate (which is the MRR lost in the period to a customer intending to fully exit our platform in the near term compared to the total MRR at the beginning of the period).
•Robust In-House Sales Capabilities. Our in-house sales force has deep knowledge of our customers’ businesses and IT infrastructure needs and is supported by sophisticated sales management, reporting and incentive systems. Our internal sales force is structured by product offerings, specialized industry segments and, with respect to our colocation product, by geographical region. Therefore, unlike certain other data center companies, we are less dependent on data center brokers to identify and acquire or renew our customers, which we believe is a key enabler of our integrated strategy. 
•Security and Compliance Focused. Our operations and compliance teams, led by seasoned management, are focused on providing a high level of physical security, cybersecurity and compliance solutions and consulting in all of our data centers and integrated across our product offerings.
•Balance Sheet Positioned to Fund Continued Growth. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available liquidity consisting of cash and cash equivalents, net proceeds available under forward equity agreements, and the ability to borrow under our unsecured senior revolving credit facility and our additional term loan. As we continue to expand our real estate portfolio, we can increase availability under our unsecured credit facilities by an additional $750 million, through an accordion feature, as well as access additional net proceeds available under forward equity agreements.
•Seasoned Management Team with Proven Track Record and Strong Alignment with Our Stockholders. Our senior management team represents a strong balance of significant experience across the commercial real estate and technology services industries. We believe our senior management team’s experience will enable us to capitalize on industry relationships by accessing capital from various sources and by providing an ongoing pipeline of attractive leasing and development opportunities while ensuring the future differentiation of our technology-enabled platform.
•Ability to Increase Our Margins Through Our Operating Leverage. We anticipate that our business and growth strategies can be substantially supported by our existing platform. The scale of our data center facilities provides a significant opportunity to realize positive operating leverage as we achieve higher customer occupancy.

•Continuing to Selectively Expand Our Platform to Other Strategic Markets. We expect to continue to selectively pursue attractive opportunities in strategic locations where we believe our fully integrated platform would give us a competitive advantage in the leasing of a facility or portfolio of assets. We also believe we can integrate additional data center facilities into our platform without adding significant incremental headcount or general and administrative expenses.
•Commitment to Environmental Sustainability. We have committed to leading the industry in sustainability by implementing cost effective, impactful programs that create value for investors and benefit society. We have committed to procuring 100% of our energy from renewable sources by 2025. We build world class LEED-designed facilities, and conserve millions of gallons of water each year through rainwater collection and greywater reuse systems. Our second annual ESG report was released during the year ended December 31, 2020, which highlighted environmental results, introduced new social programs, and discussed our governance structure. 
Competition
We compete with developers, owners and operators of data centers and with IT infrastructure companies in the market for data center customers, properties for acquisition and the services of key third-party providers. In addition, we continue to compete with owners and operators of data centers and providers of managed services that follow other business models and may offer one or more of these services. We believe, however, that our product offerings set us apart from our competitors in the data center industry and makes us more attractive to customers, both large and small. In addition, we believe other providers are seeking ways to enter or strengthen their positions in the data center market.
We compete for customers based on factors including location, network connectivity, critical load capacity, flexibility and expertise in the design and operation of data centers. New customers who consider leasing space at our properties and using our products and existing customers evaluating whether to renew or extend a lease also may consider our competitors, including wholesale infrastructure providers and colocation and managed services providers. In addition, our customers may choose to own and operate their own data centers rather than lease from us.
As an owner, developer and operator of data centers, we depend on certain third-party service providers, including engineers and contractors with expertise in the development of data centers and the provision of managed services. The level of competition for the services of specialized contractors and other third-party providers increases the cost of engaging such providers and the risk of delays in operating our data centers and completing our development and redevelopment projects. We also rely upon the services of specialized contractors for the provision of internet connectivity and software-related platforms and services. Competition for their services could lead to a negative impact on our business if they became unavailable to us.
In addition, we face competition for the acquisition of additional properties suitable for the development of data centers from real estate developers in our industry and in other industries and from customers who develop their own data center facilities. Such competition may have the effect of reducing the number of available properties for acquisition, increasing the price of any acquisition and reducing the demand for data center space in the markets we seek to serve.
Regulation
General
Data centers in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans With Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” or “commercial facilities” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require, for example, removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily 
Table of Contents

achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, wastes or petroleum products on, under, from or in such property. These costs could be substantial, liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Most of our properties presently contain large underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks for emergency power, which is critical to our operations. If any of our tanks has a release of fuel to the environment, we likely would have to pay to clean up the contamination. In addition, prior owners and operators used some of our current properties for industrial and other purposes, which could have resulted in environmental contamination. Moreover, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may (1) expose us to third-party liability (e.g., for cleanup costs, bodily injury or property damage), (2) subject our properties to liens in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination, (3) impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, or (4) materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities where we arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. Finally, there may be material environmental liabilities at our properties of which we are not aware. Any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our properties are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations and zoning requirements, including those regarding the handling of regulated substances and wastes, emissions to the environment, and fire codes. For instance, our properties are subject to regulations regarding the storage of petroleum for auxiliary or emergency power and air emissions arising from the use of power generators. In particular, generators at our data center facilities are subject to strict emissions limitations, which could preclude us from using critical back-up systems and lead to significant business disruptions at such facilities and loss of our reputation. In addition, we lease some of our properties to our customers who also are subject to such environmental, health and safety laws and zoning requirements. If we, or our customers, fail to comply with these various requirements, we might incur costs and liabilities, including governmental fines and penalties. Moreover, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially and adversely affect us. Environmental noncompliance liability also could affect a customer’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our customers to comply with these environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry, for additional information regarding these risks.
Privacy and Cybersecurity
We may be directly and/or contractually subject to laws, regulations and policies for protecting sensitive data, consumer privacy and vital national interests, some of which are new or evolving. For example, the U.S. government has promulgated regulations and standards subject to authority provided through the enactment of a number of laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (“FISMA”), which require many corporations and federal, state and local governmental entities to control the security of, access to and configuration of their IT systems. A number of states also have enacted laws and regulations that require covered entities, such as data center operators, to implement and maintain security measures to protect certain types of information, such as Social Security numbers, payment card information, and other types of data, from unauthorized use and disclosure. In recent years, three states have passed biometric data security laws and a number of other states and municipalities are exploring similar laws. QTS designed its policies and practices based on the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), which we believe is the most comprehensive and restrictive law. In addition, industry organizations have adopted and implemented various security and compliance policies. For example, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council has issued its mandatory Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) which is applicable to all organizations processing payment card transactions. In addition to federal laws, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which regulates data collection and privacy collection, took effect in 2020. Less than a year after the CCPA went 
Table of Contents

into effect, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amends various parts of the CCPA. The CPRA, which becomes effective January 1, 2023, will provide significant new rights to California consumers, create new compliance obligations for covered businesses, establish a new enforcement agency, and provide for data minimization and retention obligations. In addition to California, several other states, including Virginia and Washington, continue to consider passing their own comprehensive privacy laws. 
In connection with certain of these laws, we are subject to audits and assessments, and we may be required to obtain certain certifications. Audit failure or findings of non-compliance can lead to significant fines or decertification from engaging in certain activities. For example, violations of HIPAA/HITECH Act regulations can lead to fines of up to $1.5 million for all violations of a particular provision in a calendar year and our failure to demonstrate compliance in an annual PCI DSS audit may result in fines and exclusion from payment card networks. Additionally, violations of privacy or security laws, regulations or standards increasingly lead to class-action litigation, which can result in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. We cannot assure you that future laws, regulations and standards, or future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, related to privacy and security will not have a material adverse effect on us.
As a company that may process European personal data, we also may be subject to European data protection laws and regulations. The European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which took effect in 2018, increases the likelihood of applicability of European data protection law to entities like us, which are established outside the EU but may process data of European data subjects. Under the GDPR, there can be fines of up to €10,000,000 or up to 2% of the global sales, whichever is greater, for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the global sales, whichever is greater, for more serious offenses. Among other requirements, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S., unless there is a suitable data transfer solution in place to safeguard personal data. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the European Commission’s adequacy decision that allowed companies, such as QTS, to self-certify under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result, organizations are no longer able to use this framework to transfer personal data, and thus must use alternative transfer mechanisms. 
Also in 2018, EU member states were required to enact national laws to enforce the EU’s “Directive on security of network and information systems” (the “NIS Directive”), which lays out a number of cybersecurity expectations and notification obligations for regulated entities. In December 2020, the EU released proposed revisions to the NIS Directive that would, among other things, enhance specific cybersecurity requirements and require EU member states to have authority to issue fines of up to €10,000,000 or up to 2% of the global sales, whichever is greater. 
Insurance
We carry comprehensive general liability, property, earthquake, flood, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio. We also carry coverage for technology professional liability, and cybersecurity. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. In the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured and the risk for any failure related to professional liability or a physical or cybersecurity breach are adequately covered by our insurance. We will not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, war, wet or dry rot, vermin and, in some cases, flooding and earthquake, because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, although we carry earthquake and flood insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, such policies are subject to limitations in certain flood and seismically active zones. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry—Uninsured and underinsured losses could have a material adverse effect on us.”
Human Capital Management
As evidenced by our Powered by People approach, we believe that how we deliver our services is just as important as what is delivered. This means, among other things, caring for and improving the lives of our current and future employees. We believe our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and implementing effective and thoughtful human capital management practices constitute key elements of our corporate strategy.
Table of Contents

Headcount Data
As of December 31, 2020, our data center solutions were marketed, provided and supported by talented individuals that comprise our workforce of 634 employees. Our Facilities Operations comprised 41% of our total employee base, directly responsible for the operation of our data centers spanning 28 locations. Our management and executive employees comprise 28% of QTS’ workforce.
Recruitment
From our inception, we have been Powered by People and recognize how critical it is to invest in all QTS employees ranging from the way we attract and develop talent through accelerating engagement and fostering retention. Attracting the right talent is a foundation that supports QTS’ continued growth and success. We have broadened our traditional recruiting channels in order to discover top talent, which has, consequently, produced more diverse candidate pools. We have found success in working with organizations focused on serving transitioning service members, minorities and women.
We recognize attracting talent is also driven by ensuring our current employees are engaged. We foster employee engagement by regularly seeking feedback through surveys, focus groups and social media, as further described below. We also prioritize attracting talent by offering our current employees referral bonuses for recruiting colleagues to join QTS.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe a focus on diversity and inclusion is important to achieve our long-term growth objectives, and we strive to build an even more diverse and inclusive organization. Moreover, we believe that creating an environment where everyone feels they belong is simply the right thing to do. Our ongoing diversity efforts include recruitment at women’s technology group events, targeted recruitment campaigns aimed at attracting diverse employees, involvement with local diverse organizations focused on building bench strength, mentorship programs for women and minorities, inclusive professional groups, and involvement within the Veterans community to target a more diverse workforce. Our Women Inspiring Leadership ("WIL") program is open to all employees to participate in on a voluntary basis. We have seen the success of this internally developed program focused on developing and inspiring leaders through focus panels, training events, partnering with a professional association for women in technology and hosting guest speakers from all backgrounds. WIL also coordinates a mentoring program that is available to all QTS employees. The WIL mentoring program provides structured relationships to drive employees to their potential and provide an opportunity for QTS employees to give back to those earlier in their respective careers. The WIL program creates a natural outlet for QTS employees to have open dialogue around thoughts and feelings related to diversity.
Employee Development/Training
We focus on equipping QTS employees with the tools to grow, connect and reach their fullest potential through our various development programs. Our state-of-the-art training facilities allow us to reach across the organization and bring QTS employees together and foster professional growth, whether it be in person or virtual. We have established leadership competencies for all employees and ensure leaders at every level work to engrain these competencies within their teams through their everyday actions. We believe our leaders are our strongest conduit to fostering our culture and driving employee engagement and are pleased at the success that has come from our Lead the Way program which provides tailored content and development training so that our leaders have the tools they need to be successful. 
Our strategy behind investing in employee development has better prepared and equipped employees to serve our clients, increased our internal hiring opportunities, attracted candidates committed to continuous learning and enabled a higher level of employee fulfillment and satisfaction.
Employee Engagement
Maintaining employee engagement, energy and satisfaction is a top priority. We execute on this priority in several ways including acknowledging employee effort and performance, reinforcing behaviors that align with our Core Values, supporting a variety of wellness programs and opportunities and providing competitive compensation based on merit.
We continue to engage employees through our succession planning initiatives, focusing on developing and rewarding QTS employees who are most critical to achieving our business objectives and make the largest impact. We ensure succession 
Table of Contents

plans are built for our critical roles, leveraging insights to build internal pipelines of candidates. Our leaders complete company-wide talent reviews on a regular basis to ensure we maximize our talent landscape.
We recognize the need to consistently focus on the evolving needs of employees and have introduced several programs to drive engagement and ensure employee needs are being met, including:
•Employee Value Proposition ("EVP") - QTS’ EVP program is comprised of employee volunteers at each QTS location who meet regularly to discuss local employee concerns and feedback. Their direct connection to senior leadership provides QTS senior leadership the ability to quickly understand needs and define where to focus its resources and benefits. 
•Employee Experience - QTS’ Employee Experience program focuses on broad topics across the organization that drive employee engagement. In 2020, our areas of focus and key wins addressed tools needed to drive efficiency and ease of use, communication methods and vehicles, and recognition and rewards. 
•Wellness - QTS’ Wellness program focuses on mental, physical and financial health and includes quarterly wellness challenges. The top challenges in 2020 were ‘Step It Up’, a friendly step-counting competition to promote physical health, as well as ‘QTS Chef’ featuring themed weekly cooking competitions.
•Facilities Career Pathing - Our Facilities Career Pathing program clearly defines the career roadmap for our facilities employees including the necessary steps to complete for promotion. The program provides clarity, consistency and recognition for those who wish to grow their career at QTS within the facilities organizations. 
•QTS Journey - QTS Journey is a robust onboarding initiative which brings new employees from across the organization together to efficiently learn about QTS’ business and functions, build an immediate network and enable quick contributions and performance. 
•Eagle Club - The purpose of the QTS Eagle Club is to give recognition and acknowledgement to employees for their exceptional contributions and accomplishments within their role over a 12-month period.
Community Service and Volunteerism 
Community service and volunteerism are pillars of our culture and engrained in our people. Every year, QTS provides all QTS employees three (3) paid days to volunteer and give back to QTS communities. While many volunteer events were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, our employees continued to support the local communities in which we operate in various forms, including donations to food banks and hosting toy and winter coat drives.
Offices
Our executive headquarters is located at 12851 Foster Street, Overland Park, Kansas 66213, where our telephone number is (913) 814-9988. We believe that our current offices are adequate for our present operations; however, based on the anticipated growth of our company, we may add regional offices depending upon our future operational needs.
