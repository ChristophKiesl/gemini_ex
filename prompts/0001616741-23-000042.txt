Item 1. BUSINESS.
Our Business. Our business, conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary Florida Rock & Tank Lines, Inc., consists of hauling petroleum related products, dry bulk commodities and liquids. We are one of the largest regional tank truck carriers in North America. We operate terminals in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. We do not own any of the products we haul; rather, we act as a third-party carrier to deliver our customers’ products from point A to point B, using predominately Company employees and Company-owned tractors and tank trailers. Approximately 86% of our business consists of hauling liquid petroleum products (mostly gas and diesel fuel) from large scale fuel storage facilities to our customers’ retail outlets (e.g. convenience stores, truck stops and fuel depots) where we off-load the product into our customers’ fuel storage tanks for ultimate sale to the retail consumer. The remaining 14% of our business consists of hauling dry bulk commodities such as cement, lime and various industrial powder products, water and liquid chemicals. As of September 30, 2023, we employed 323 revenue-producing drivers who operated our fleet of 264 Company tractors, 52 owner operators and 389 trailers from our 17 terminals and 6 satellite locations.
 
Agreement and Plan of Merger. On November 1, 2023 the Company entered into a merger agreement under which affiliates of United Petroleum Transports, Inc. (“UPT”) will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock for $16.26 per share in cash (referred to herein as, the “merger”). The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including the approval of the Company’s shareholders. UPT has obtained a customary financing commitment from an established lending institution pursuant to which the lender will provide financing that, together with other available sources, is expected to be sufficient to fund the merger consideration and other obligations under the merger agreement. Shareholders collectively beneficially owning 26.6% of the voting power of the Company’s common stock have agreed to vote in favor of the merger, subject to customary exceptions. Upon completion of the transaction, which the parties expect will occur by late 2023 or early 2024, the Company will become a private company and delist from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
 
Tractors and Trailers. During fiscal 2023, the Company replaced 72 tractors and 5 trailers. We believe maintaining a modern fleet will result in reduced maintenance expenses, improved operating efficiencies and enhanced driver recruitment and retention.
Competition. The tank lines transportation business is extremely competitive and fragmented. We have multiple competitors in each of our markets, consisting of other carriers of varying sizes as well as our customers’ private fleets. Price, service, and location are the major competitive factors in each local market. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and a more expansive geographic footprint than our company. Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices, implement new pricing strategies, or maintain significant growth in our business. Our largest competitors include Kenan Advantage Group, Eagle Transport, and Penn Tank Lines. We also compete with smaller carriers in most of our markets. 
 
Our industry is characterized by such barriers to entry as the time and cost required to develop the capabilities necessary to handle hazardous material, the resources required to recruit, train and retain drivers, substantial industry regulatory and insurance requirements and the significant capital investments required to build a fleet of equipment, establish a network of terminals and, in recent years, the cost to build and maintain sufficient information technology resources to allow us to interface with and assist our customers in the day-to-day management of their product inventories.
 
Our ability to provide superior customer service at competitive rates and to operate safely and efficiently is important to our success in growing our revenues and increasing profitability. Our focus is to grow our profitability by executing on our key strategies of (i) increasing our business with existing and new customers, particularly hypermarket and large convenience store chains, that are willing to compensate us for our ability to provide superior, safe and reliable service, (ii) expanding our service offerings with respect to dry bulk, liquid and chemical products particularly in markets where we already operate terminals, (iii) earning the reputation as the preferred employer for tank truck drivers in all the markets in which we operate and (iv) pursuing strategic acquisitions. Our ability to

execute this strategy depends on continuing our dedicated commitments to customer service and safety and continuing to recruit and retain qualified drivers.
 
 Customers. Approximately 86% of our business consists of hauling petroleum related products. Our petroleum clients include major convenience store and hypermarket accounts, fuel wholesalers and major oil companies. We strive to build long-term relationships with major customers by providing outstanding customer service. During fiscal 2023, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 60.0% of revenue. One of these customers accounted for 16.9% of revenue. The loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and income. Our top 10 accounts have been customers for at least 10 years.
 
Our dry bulk and chemical customers include large industrial companies including cement and concrete accounts and product distribution companies. Our customer relationships are long-standing and have grown over time as a result of consistently high safety and service levels.
 
In September 2020, we entered into a contract with a customer to haul spring water in seven food grade trailers. This is the Company’s first venture into the food grade space.
 
Sales and Marketing. Our marketing activities are focused on building our relationships with existing customers as well as developing new business opportunities. Our senior management team has extensive experience in marketing specialized fuels delivery services. In addition, significant portions of our marketing activities are conducted locally by our regional managers, terminal managers and dispatchers who act as local customer service representatives. These managers and dispatchers maintain regular contact with customers and are well-positioned to identify the changing transportation needs of customers in their respective geographic areas. We also actively participate in various trade associations, including the National Tank Truck Carriers Association, various state trucking and petroleum marketing associations and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers Association.
Environmental Matters. Our activities, which involve the transportation, storage and disposal of fuels and other hazardous substances and wastes, are subject to various federal, state and local health and safety laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including, among others, those governing the transportation, management and disposal of hazardous materials, vehicle emissions, underground and above ground storage tanks and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Our operations involve risks of fuel spillage or seepage, hazardous waste disposal and other activities that are potentially damaging to the environment. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of or liable under applicable laws or regulations, it could significantly increase our cost of doing business.
 
Most of our truck terminals are located in industrial areas, where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Under environmental laws, we could be held responsible for the costs relating to any contamination at those or other of our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, including cleanup costs, fines and penalties and personal injury and property damages. Under some of these laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (also known as the Superfund law) and comparable state statutes, liability for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites can be imposed upon any current or former owner or operator, or upon any party who sent waste to the site, regardless of the lawfulness of any disposal activities or whether a party owned or operated a contaminated property at the time of the release of hazardous substances. From time to time, we have incurred remedial costs and/or regulatory penalties with respect to chemical or wastewater spills and releases relating to our facilities or operations, and, notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program, we may incur such obligations in the future. The discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations or liabilities in the future could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or our business reputation.
 
Our operations involve hazardous materials and could result in significant environmental liabilities and costs. For a discussion of certain risks of our being associated with transporting hazardous substances see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business”
 
Seasonality. Our business is subject to seasonal trends common in the refined petroleum products delivery industry. We typically face reduced demand for refined petroleum products delivery services during the winter months and increased demand during the spring and summer months. Further, operating costs and earnings are generally adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. These factors generally result in lower operating results during

the first and second fiscal quarters of the year and cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our operating expenses also have been somewhat higher in the winter months, due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs for tractors and trailers in colder months.
 
Human Capital. As of September 30, 2023, the Company employed 466 people. Our industry is experiencing a severe shortage of qualified professional drivers with a tenured safe driving career. The trend we are seeing is that more and more of the applicants are drivers with little to no experience in the tank truck business, short driving careers in other lines of trucking, poor safety records and a pattern of job instability in their work history. As a result, in many markets we serve it is difficult to grow the driver count and, in some cases, to even maintain our historical or desired driver counts. There are several opportunities available today in our markets that will allow us to execute on our strategy so long as we can find, hire and retain qualified drivers to meet the demands of these opportunities.
