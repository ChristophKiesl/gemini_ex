ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (“CPRL”), together with its subsidiaries (“CP” or the “Company”), owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States (“U.S.”). CP provides rail and intermodal transportation services over a network of approximately 13,000 miles, directly serving the principal business centres of Canada from Montréal, Québec, to Vancouver, British Columbia ("B.C."), and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest regions. CP’s railway network feeds directly into the U.S. heartland from the East and West coasts. Agreements with other carriers extend the Company's market reach in Canada, through the U.S. and into Mexico. CP transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. For additional information regarding CP's network and geographical locations, refer to Item 2. Properties. 
CPRL was incorporated on June 22, 2001, under the Canada Business Corporations Act and controls and owns all of the Common Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Company (“CPRC”), which was incorporated in 1881 by Letters Patent pursuant to an Act of the Parliament of Canada. CPRL's registered, executive and corporate head office is located at 7550 Ogden Dale Road S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2C 4X9. CPRL's Common Shares (the "Common Shares") are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CP”.
For purposes of this annual report, all references herein to “CP”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to CPRL, CPRL and its subsidiaries, CPRL and one or more of its subsidiaries, or one or more of CPRL's subsidiaries, as the context may require.

Strategy
CP is continuing the journey to become the best railway in North America, with a culture of responsibility and accountability focused on five key foundations:
•Provide Service: Providing efficient and consistent transportation solutions for the Company’s customers. “Doing what we say we are going to do” is what drives CP in providing a reliable product with a lower cost operating model. Centralized planning aligned with local execution is bringing the Company closer to the customer and accelerating decision-making. 
•Control Costs: Controlling and removing unnecessary costs from the organization, eliminating bureaucracy and continuing to identify productivity enhancements are the keys to success. 
•Optimize Assets: Through longer and heavier trains, and improved asset utilization, the Company is moving increased volumes with fewer locomotives and cars while unlocking capacity for future growth potential.  
•Operate Safely: Each year, CP safely moves millions of carloads of freight across North America while ensuring the safety of our people and the communities through which we operate. Safety is never to be compromised. CP strives for continuous implementation of state-of-the-art safety technology, safety management systems, and safety culture with our employees to ensure safe, efficient operations across our network.
•Develop People: CP recognizes that none of the other foundations can be achieved without its people. Every CP employee is a railroader and the Company has established a culture focused on our values of accountability, diversity and pride, in everything we do. Coaching and mentoring all employees into becoming leaders will continue to drive CP forward.
Starting in 2012, CP transformed its operations by investing in the network and executing a precision scheduled railroading model that lowers costs, optimizes assets, and provides better, more competitive service. 
Today, we continue to apply our long-term strategy: leverage our lower cost base, network strengths and improved service to drive sustainable, profitable growth. While the accomplishments during the turnaround were tremendous, CP’s journey to become North America’s best-performing rail carrier is far from over. As a Company, we will remain focused on our next level of service, productivity, and innovation to continue to generate sustainable value for our customers and results for our shareholders. 
Business Developments
COVID-19 pandemic
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand resulted in lower volumes in the following lines of business: Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, and Automotive. 
As COVID-19 continued to spread throughout Canada and the United States during 2020, CP conducted business as usual, to the greatest extent possible in the circumstances, while continuing to apply the principles of precision scheduled railroading to respond to changes in demand. The Company is continuing to take a variety of measures to ensure the availability of its transportation services throughout our network, promote the safety and security of our 
  CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Certain modifications the Company has made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include but are not limited to: implementing periods of working at home for certain office employees; restricting employee business travel; implementing post-travel employee screening; strengthening clean workplace practices; reinforcing socially responsible sick leave recommendations; limiting visitor and third-party access to Company facilities; launching internal COVID-19 resources for employees; creating a pandemic response team comprised of employees and members of senior management; and encouraging telephonic and video conference-based meetings along with other hygiene and social distancing practices recommended by health authorities including Health Canada, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. CP supported employees by working with labour unions to shorten recall times to be prepared for demand increases while supplementing employment insurance payments and maintaining health benefit coverage for employees during that period. CP also awarded a bonus for our frontline employees who worked or were laid off in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CP is responding to this crisis through measures designed to protect our workforce and prevent disruptions to the central role the Company's operations provide to the North American economy. CP's service is deemed essential as part of the transportation industry. We believe that we remain well positioned to adjust to market conditions to assist our customers as they work to manage their supply chain and inventories. 
Preventative measures that serve to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 remain in effect, including modifying our workspace to implement physical distancing measures, and continuously reevaluating our efforts with safety as a top priority. 
In addition to the above, we have also observed many other companies, including companies in our industry, taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and companies may take further actions that alter their normal business operations. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that could materially alter our business operations as may be required or recommended by federal, provincial, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, shareholders, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders. 
Additional information concerning the impact COVID-19 may have to our future business and results of operations is provided in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Other current business developments
On January 27, 2021, CP announced its Board of Directors will seek shareholder and regulatory approval for the implementation of a five-for-one share split of CP's issued and outstanding common shares. The share split is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders scheduled to be held on April 21, 2021 and to the requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10 Business combination.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, CP announced its plan to develop North America's first line-haul hydrogen-powered locomotive. CP's Hydrogen Locomotive Program will retrofit a line-haul locomotive with hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology to drive the locomotive's electric traction motors. Once operational, CP will conduct rail service trials and qualification testing to evaluate the technology's readiness for the freight-rail sector. The work builds on CP's prior experience with testing low-emitting locomotive technologies, including biofuels, compressed natural gas and battery-powered solutions. This project aligns with CP's focus on finding innovative solutions to support a sustainable future.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, CP received a leadership level score of A- from CDP for its 2020 climate change disclosure. This accomplishment represented a significant milestone in CP's journey to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into the company's sustainability programs and reporting practices. CDP is an internationally recognized non-profit organization that runs a global environmental disclosure platform assessing companies on their climate-related performance and transparency.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, CP was added to the 2020 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America. The index measures corporate sustainability leaders' performance through a comprehensive assessment of economic, environmental and social criteria. The top companies were selected from a record number of participants.
In the third quarter of 2020, CP released its first public statement on climate change, acknowledging the effects of rising global temperatures and our commitment to ongoing efforts to mitigate the impacts. The statement supports the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, which seek to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. In support of this initiative, we plan to establish a science-based emissions reduction target to guide our climate action. 
 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 

On July 21, 2020, CP increased its quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share on the outstanding Common Shares, from $0.83 per share from the prior quarter.
In the second quarter of 2020, CP completed its previously announced acquisition of Central Maine and Québec Railway U.S. Inc. ("CMQ U.S."). Together with the December 30, 2019 completion of the acquisition of Central Maine & Québec Railway Canada Inc. ("CMQ Canada"), the acquisition of CMQ U.S. completed CP's purchase of the entire Central Maine & Québec Railway ("CMQ") network originally announced on November 20, 2019, for approximately $174 million (U.S. $133 million). CMQ U.S. and CMQ Canada will continue to operate in the U.S. and in Canada respectively as subsidiaries of CP. CMQ owns rail lines primarily in Québec and Maine, stretching approximately 481 miles, and primarily moving forest products, refined petroleum products, chemicals and plastics. This acquisition provides CP with strategic access into the U.S. Northeast and Atlantic Canada. The transaction provides CP customers with seamless, safe and efficient access to ports at Searsport, Maine, and to Saint John, New Brunswick, via Eastern Maine Railway Company and New Brunswick Southern Railway. With the CMQ acquisition, CP is now a 13,000-mile rail network connecting the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast across six Canadian provinces and 11 U.S. states. For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10 Business combination.
On April 21, 2020, the Company held its annual meeting of shareholders, which was conducted via a virtual only format by live webcast online for the first time. All 11 director nominees were elected.
Prior Developments
On December 17, 2019, the Company announced an NCIB, commencing December 20, 2019, to purchase up to 4.80 million Common Shares in the open market for cancellation before December 19, 2020.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company experienced severe winter operating conditions and an increase in the frequency and severity of casualty incidents and derailments. As a result, the Company incurred significant costs to manage severe weather conditions, as well as direct casualty costs, and higher operating costs. During this period and the subsequent network recovery the Company also experienced losses and deferrals of potential revenues.
Operations
The Company operates in only one operating segment: rail transportation. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by business line, the overall financial and operational performance of the Company is analyzed as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. Additional information regarding the Company's business and operations, including revenue and financial information, and information by geographic location is presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 27 Segmented and geographic information.

CP's Grain network is unique among railways in North America as it is strategically positioned in the heart of grain-producing regions of western Canada and the Northern Plains of the U.S. Canadian grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, canola, durum, pulses, and barley, and processed products such as oils, meals, and malt. This business is centred in the Canadian Prairies (Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba), with grain shipped primarily west to the Port of Vancouver, and east to the Port of Thunder Bay for export. Grain is also shipped to the U.S., to eastern Canada, and to Mexico for domestic consumption.
Canadian grain includes a division of business that is regulated by the Canadian government through the Canada Transportation Act (“CTA”). This regulated business is subject to a maximum revenue entitlement (“MRE”). Under the CTA, railways can set their own rates for individual movements. However, the MRE governs aggregate revenue earned by the railway based on a formula that factors in the total volumes, length of haul, average revenue per ton, and inflationary adjustments. The regulation applies to western Canadian export grain shipments to the ports of Vancouver and Thunder Bay.
U.S. grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, soybeans, corn and durum, and processed products such as feed, meals and flour. This business is centred in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa. Grain destined for domestic consumption moves east via Chicago, to the U.S. Northeast or is interchanged with other carriers to the U.S. Pacific Northwest and U.S. Southeast. In partnership with other railways, CP also moves grain to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Gulf of Mexico. Export grain traffic is also shipped to ports at Superior and Duluth.

2020 Intermodal Revenues | 2019 Intermodal Revenues | 2018 Intermodal Revenues 
(21% of Freight Revenues) | (21% of Freight Revenues) | (22% of Freight Revenues)

Domestic intermodal freight consists primarily of manufactured consumer products that are predominantly moved in 53-foot containers within North America. International intermodal freight moves in marine containers to and from ports and North American inland markets.
  CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
CP’s domestic intermodal business moves goods from a broad spectrum of industries including wholesale, retail, food, forest products, and various other commodities. Key service factors in domestic intermodal include consistent on-time delivery, the ability to provide door-to-door service, and the availability of value-added services. The majority of the Company’s domestic intermodal business originates in Canada, where CP markets its services directly to retailers and manufacturers, providing complete door-to-door service and maintaining direct relationships with its customers. In the U.S., the Company’s service is delivered mainly through intermodal marketing companies.
CP’s international intermodal business consists primarily of containerized traffic moving between the ports of Vancouver, Montréal, Saint John, and inland points across Canada and the U.S. Import traffic from the Port of Vancouver is mainly long-haul business destined for eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. CP works closely with the Port of Montréal, a major year-round East Coast gateway to Europe, to serve markets primarily in the U.S. Midwest and Canada. CP's access to the Port of Saint John provides the fastest rail service from the east coast to the Canadian and U.S. Midwest markets for import and export cargo from Europe, South America, and Asia.
Fuel Cost Adjustment Program
The short-term volatility in fuel prices may adversely or positively impact revenues. CP employs a fuel cost adjustment program designed to respond to fluctuations in fuel prices and help reduce volatility to changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues are earned on individual shipments and are based primarily on the price of On-Highway Diesel. As such, fuel surcharge revenues are a function of freight volumes and fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues accounted for approximately 4% of the Company's Freight revenues in 2020. The Company is also subject to carbon taxation systems and levies in some jurisdictions in which it operates, the costs of which are passed on to the shipper. As such, fuel surcharge revenue includes carbon taxes and levy recoveries.
Freight revenues included fuel surcharge revenues of $297 million in 2020, a decrease of $167 million, or 36%, from $464 million in the same period of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower fuel prices. This decrease was partially offset by the timing of recoveries from CP's fuel cost adjustment program and increased carbon tax recoveries.
Non-freight Revenues
Non-freight revenues accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s Total revenues in 2020. Non-freight revenues are generated from leasing certain assets; other arrangements, including logistical services and contracts with passenger service operators; and switching fees.
Significant Customers
For each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the company's revenues and operations were not dependent on any major customers. 
Competition
The Company is in the ground transportation and logistics business. The Company sees competition in this segment from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Depending on the specific market, competing railways, motor carriers, and other competitors may exert pressure on price and service levels. The Company continually evaluates the market needs and the competition. The Company responds as it deems appropriate to provide competitive services to the market. This includes developing new offerings such as transload facilities, new train services, and other logistics services.
Seasonality
Volumes and revenues from certain goods are stronger during different periods of the year. First-quarter revenues are typically lower mainly due to winter weather conditions, closure of the Port of Thunder Bay, and reduced transportation of retail goods. Second and third quarter revenues generally improve compared to the first quarter, as fertilizer volumes are typically highest during the second quarter and demand for construction-related goods is generally highest in the third quarter. Revenues are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the transportation of grain after the harvest, fall fertilizer programs, and increased demand for retail goods moved by rail. Operating income is also affected by seasonal fluctuations. Operating income is typically lowest in the first quarter, due to lower freight revenue and higher operating costs associated with winter conditions.
 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 

Government Regulation
The Company’s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations, and rules in both Canada and the U.S., which directly affect how operations and business activities are managed.
Economic Regulation - Canada
The Company’s rail operations in Canada are subject to economic regulation by the Canadian Transportation Agency (the "Agency”) as delegated by the Canada Transportation Act. The Canada Transportation Act indirectly regulates rates by providing remedies for freight rates, including ancillary charges, remedies for level of service, long-haul interswitching rates, and regulated interswitching rates in Canada. The CTA regulates the MRE for the movement of export grain, construction and abandonment of railways, commuter and passenger access, and noise and vibration-related disputes. 
In 2018, the Transportation Modernization Act became law. The legislation amended the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act ("RSA"), among other Acts, to (1) replace the previous 160 kilometre extended interswitching limit and the competitive line rate provisions with a new long-haul interswitching regime; (2) modify the existing Level of Service remedy for shippers by instructing the Agency to determine, upon receipt of a complaint, if a railway company is fulfilling its common carrier obligation to the “highest level of service that is reasonable in the circumstances”; (3) allow the existing Service Level Agreement arbitration remedy to include the consideration of reciprocal financial penalties; (4) increase the threshold for summary Final Offer Arbitration from $750,000 to $2 million; (5) bifurcate the Volume-Related Composite Price Index component of the annual MRE determination for transportation of regulated grain, to encourage hopper car investment by CP and Canadian National Railway ("CN"); (6) mandate the installation of locomotive voice and video recorders ("LVVRs"), with statutory permission for random access by railway companies and Transport Canada ("TC") to the LVVR data in order to proactively strengthen railway safety in Canada; and (7) compel railways to provide additional data to the federal government.
Economic Regulation - U.S.
The Company’s U.S. rail operations are subject to economic regulation by the Surface Transportation Board (the “STB”). The STB provides economic regulatory oversight and administers Title 49 of the United States Code and related Code of Federal Regulations. The STB has jurisdiction over railroad rate and service issues and proposed railroad mergers and other transactions.
The STB Reauthorization Act of 2015 resulted in numerous changes to the structure and composition of the STB, removing it from under the Department of Transport and establishing the STB as an independent U.S. agency, as well as increasing STB Board membership from three to five members. Notably, the law vests in the STB certain limited enforcement powers, by authorizing it to investigate rail carrier violations on the STB Board’s own initiative. The law also requires the STB to establish a voluntary binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate and practice disputes.
Safety Regulation - Canada
The Company’s operations in Canada are subject to safety regulatory oversight by TC pursuant to the RSA. The RSA regulates safety-related aspects of railway operations in Canada, including the delegation of inspection, investigation and enforcement powers to TC. TC is also responsible for overseeing the transportation of dangerous goods as set out under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act ("TDGA").
After the tragic accident in Lac-Mégantic, Québec, in July 2013 involving a non-related short-line railway company, the Government of Canada implemented several measures pursuant to the RSA and the TDGA. These modifications implemented changes with respect to rules associated with securing unattended trains; the classification of crude being imported, handled, offered for transport, or transported; and the provision of information to municipalities through which dangerous goods are transported by rail. The U.S. federal government has taken similar actions. These changes did not have a material impact on CP’s operating practices.
In 2015, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act became law. The legislation sets out minimum insurance requirements for federally regulated railways based on amounts of crude and toxic inhalation hazards ("TIH") or poisonous inhalation hazards moved. It also imposes strict liability; limits railway liability to the minimum insurance level; mandates the creation of a fund paid for by levies on crude shipments, to be utilized for damages beyond a railway's liability; allows railways and insurers to maintain rights to pursue other parties (subrogation); and prevents shifting liability to shippers from railways except through written agreement.
The Company is allocating resources, including working with public and private rail crossing owners, to meet the Grade Crossings Regulations, under the RSA, which came into force in 2014. The regulations require existing crossings to meet specified safety standards by November 2021. 
On November 25, 2020, the Minister of Transport announced updated Duty and Rest Period Rules for Railway Operating Employees. The new rules, founded on modern-day fatigue management principles, reduce the length of a duty period and increase the length of the minimum rest period between shifts. The rules establish limits on the total number of duty hours, 60 hours in a seven-day period and 192 hours in a 28-day period. These requirements will be phased in 30 months from the date of the announcement. The new rules also require federally regulated railways, including the Company, to complete a Fatigue Management Plan by November 25, 2021, and implement the Fitness for Duty provisions by November 25, 2022. 
  CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
Safety Regulation - U.S.
The Company’s U.S. operations are subject to safety regulations enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). The FRA regulates safety-related aspects of the Company’s railway operations in the U.S. under the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as well as rail portions of other safety statutes. The PHMSA regulates the safe transportation of all hazardous materials by rail.
On October 29, 2015, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 ("STEA") was signed into law. The law extends, by three years, the deadline for the U.S. rail industry to implement Positive Train Control (“PTC”), a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments, and other accidents caused by human error by determining the precise location, direction and speed of trains, warning train operators of potential problems, and taking immediate action if an operator does not respond. Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 2008 mandated that PTC systems be operable by the end of 2015 on rail lines used to transport passengers or toxic-by-inhalation materials. The STEA extended the deadline to install and activate PTC to December 31, 2018, with an optional two-year extension (December 31, 2020) under certain circumstances. The Company received the two-year extension to ensure safe and effective implementation of PTC on its rail network. CP successfully implemented PTC and was PTC compliant as of December 1, 2020.
For further details on the capital expenditures associated with compliance with the PTC regulatory mandate, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Various other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company’s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental, and other matters.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Company’s operations and real estate assets are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to the air, management and remediation of historical contaminant sites, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials. If the Company is found to have violated such laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and reputation.
The Company has implemented an Environmental Management System to facilitate the reduction of environmental risk. Specific environmental programs are in place to address areas such as air emissions, wastewater, management of vegetation, chemicals and waste, storage tanks, and fueling facilities. CP has also undertaken environmental impact assessments and risk assessments to identify, prevent, and mitigate environmental risks. There is continued focus on preventing spills and other incidents that have a negative impact on the environment. There is an established strategic emergency response contractor network, and spill equipment kits are located across Canada and the U.S. to ensure a rapid and efficient response in the event of an environmental incident. In addition, emergency preparedness and response plans are regularly updated and tested. In 2020, updates to CP's comprehensive oil spill response plan were made in accordance with the changes in the PHMSA regulations.
The Company has developed an environmental audit program that comprehensively, systematically, and regularly assesses the Company’s facilities for compliance with legal requirements and the Company’s policies for conformance to accepted industry standards. Included in this is a corrective action follow-up process and semi-annual review by senior management.
CP focuses on key strategies, identifying tactics and actions to support and operationalize our environmental commitments. The Company’s strategies include:
•Implementing measures to minimize or prevent environmental impacts from our operations and facilities, and to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;
•Maintaining an Environmental Management System to provide consistent, effective guidance and resources to CP employees in regard to the management of air emissions, dangerous goods and waste materials, emergency preparedness and response, petroleum products management, and water and wastewater systems;
•Reducing environmental and safety risk through business processes to identify and mitigate potential environmental impacts related to all CP operations and activities;
•Ensuring that new or altered operations and other business activities are evaluated, planned, permitted in accordance with applicable regulations, and executed to mitigate environmental risk; 
•Engaging with relevant stakeholders to consider and discuss CP’s environmental management practices and environmental issues and concerns associated with our operations;
•Employing best practices, proven technologies, and safe operating standards for activities involving elevated environmental risk; and
•Planning and preparing for emergency responses to ensure all appropriate steps are taken in the event of a derailment, spill, or other incident involving a release to the environment.
 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 

Security
CP is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in Canada and the U.S. that address security concerns. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system. Rail lines, facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks, actions by criminal and non-criminal organizations, and activities by individuals. Regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. include speed restrictions, chain of custody and security measures, which can impact service and increase costs for the transportation of hazardous materials, especially TIH materials. New regulations published by TC under the TDGA have added requirements for railway companies to take actions to mitigate security risks of transporting dangerous goods by rail. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of the Company’s current coverage could increase significantly, or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future. While CP will continue to work closely with Canadian and U.S. government agencies, future decisions by these agencies on security matters or decisions by the industry in response to security threats to the North American rail network could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or operating results.

CP takes the following security measures:
•CP employs its own police service that works closely with communities and other law enforcement and government agencies to promote railway safety and infrastructure security. As a railway law enforcement agency, CP Police Services is headquartered in Calgary, with police officers assigned to over 25 field offices responsible for railway police operations in six Canadian provinces and 14 U.S. states. CP Police Services operates on the CP rail network as well as in areas where CP has non-railway operations;
•CP’s Police Communication Centre (“PCC”) operates 24 hours a day. PCC receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials. PCC ensures that proper emergency responders are notified as well as governing bodies;
•CP’s Security Management Plan is a comprehensive, risk-based plan modelled on and developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads post-September 11, 2001. Under this plan, CP routinely examines and prioritizes railway assets, physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and threats, as well as tests and revises measures to provide essential railway security. To address cyber security risks, CP implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. The Company has also worked diligently to establish backup sites to ensure a seamless transition in the event that the Company's operating systems are the target of a cyber-attack. By doing so, CP is able to maintain network fluidity; and
•CP security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training, periodic security assessments, engagement with our customers, and training of emergency responders. 
Human Capital Management
CP is focused on attracting, developing, and retaining a resilient, high performing workforce that delivers on providing service for our customers. CP's culture is guided by three core values: Accountability, Diversity, and Pride. These values drive our actions. Everything we do is grounded in precision scheduled railroading and our five foundations of Provide Service, Control Costs, Optimize Assets, Operate Safely, and Develop People. 
At CP, our approximately 12,000-strong team of railroaders across North America underpin CP’s success and bring value to our customers and shareholders. Accordingly, Develop People is one foundation of how we do business, illustrating our focus and energy towards empowering our people, providing an engaging culture and cultivating an industry leading team. 
Total Employees and Workforce
An employee is defined by the Company as an individual currently engaged in full-time, part-time, or seasonal employment with CP. The total number of employees as of December 31, 2020, was 11,890, a decrease of 804, or 6%, compared to 12,694 as at December 31, 2019, due to reduced workload as measured in GTMs and more efficient resource planning.
Workforce is defined as total employees plus contractors and consultants. The total workforce as at December 31, 2020 was 11,904, a decrease of 828, or 7%, compared to 12,732 as at December 31, 2019, due to more efficient resource planning. .
Unionized Workforce
Class I railways are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labour unions. The majority of CP's employees belong to labour unions and are subject to these agreements. CP manages collaborative relationships with union members in both Canada and the U.S.
CP employs approximately 12,000 active employees across North America with three-quarters based in Canada and the remainder in the United States. Unionized employees represent nearly 72% of our workforce and are represented by 36 active bargaining units. 
Canada
Within Canada there are eight bargaining units representing approximately 6,600 Canadian unionized active employees. From time to time, we negotiate to renew collective agreements with various unionized groups of employees. In such cases, the collective agreements remain in effect until the bargaining process has been exhausted (pursuant to the Canada Labour Code). One agreement is pending ratification and one other remains open for renewal and is 
  CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
under negotiation as of December 31, 2020. Agreements are in place with the other six bargaining units in Canada, two are effective until December 31, 2021, and four are effective until 2022. 
U.S.
In the U.S., there are currently 28 active bargaining units on three subsidiary railroads representing nearly 1,900 unionized active employees. Nine agreements are open for amendment and are under negotiation at this time. 15 agreements will become amendable in 2021 and one in 2022. Negotiations have been concluded with respect to the remaining three agreements which will expire beyond 2022. 
Health and Safety
CP is an industry leader in rail safety and we are committed to protecting our employees, our communities, our environment, and our customers’ goods. This is CP's 15th consecutive year as industry leader in train accident statistics. Operate Safely is one of our five foundations of successful railroading and it starts with knowing and following the rules. Aside from running trains, many of our employees work in yards, terminals, and shops across our network with machinery and heavy equipment, or in extreme weather conditions. Their safety and security is of utmost importance to CP and is foundational to the way we view employee safety education and training. CP HomeSafeTM is an initiative designed to improve our safety culture by tapping into the human side of safety and promoting both safety engagement and feedback. HomeSafeTM puts everyone on the same level and empowers all employees to begin a safety conversation, no matter the rank or position. Safety performance is disclosed publicly on a quarterly basis using standardized metrics set out by the FRA. Additional information on FRA safety measures is included in Performance Indicators in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Talent Management
CP’s approach for talent management begins with our Human Resources department, which oversees recruitment, hiring, development, engagement, and retention with the current and future workforce and leadership of CP. 
The Management Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and informs CP’s compensation plan and programming, and makes recommendations to the Board on succession planning for senior management and processes to identify, develop, and retain executive talent. Additionally, as part of CP’s succession planning program, senior leaders are actively engaged in building the pool of future leaders, and present their development plans to the Board.
CP maintains a number of internal policies related to recruitment, relocation, compensation, employment equity, and diversity and inclusion. The effective implementation of these policies alongside our ongoing workforce initiatives ensures CP’s attraction and recruitment, employee development, succession, engagement, and diversity and inclusion practices are consistent and aligned with CP’s commitments, foundations and values.
Attraction and Recruitment
With a rail network spanning Canada and the U.S., we employ a number of recruitment and retention tactics to attract the best and diverse talent across North America. CP offers many rewarding career opportunities in a variety of roles within the organization in both operating and support functions. We base our recruitment strategy on workforce planning needs, and our focus is on ensuring that we have a diverse candidate pool to fill our open positions.
CP recognizes the valuable skills and experience that veterans have gained from serving their country. Our veteran program was recognized as part of Canada's Best Diversity Employers® of 2020 and we were named part of the top 10 Military Friendly® employers in the U.S. for 2021. 
CP tracks recruitment performance and success rates to better understand which tactics, benefits, and strategic partnerships are most successful in bringing in and retaining new talent.
Talent Development & Succession
As part of our core foundation and commitment to Develop People, we encourage all employees to take an active role in their career planning and development. We believe that investing in our employees leads to improved workplace morale and fosters a supportive working environment.
Training and Development
CP offers a variety of training courses through our Learning Management System that provides online and technical training, including mandatory, role-specific and voluntary courses. This enables our employees to succeed in their current roles and prepares them for career advancement opportunities. 
Non-union employees also complete annual performance management and development action plans with their supervisors to set individual goals and track progress against Company expectations as well as long-term career goals. 
 CP 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 

CP offers key development programs for current and emerging leaders. For our Operations groups, CP’s Leadership Management Trainee program provides internal and external candidates with comprehensive training on the critical skills necessary for railway operations and people leadership. Upon successful completion of the six to seven month program, participants qualify for a variety of operations frontline leader roles.
Leadership skills are long considered a core trait of CP employees. We encourage staff to develop leadership expertise as part of ongoing training and development through regular performance reviews and CP-specific skill development programs. Our Consequence Leadership training program focuses on creating a high-performance culture and feedback-rich environment at CP. The online learning module and interactive workshops introduce a practical set of tools and thought processes for instilling communications skills and management capabilities in our leaders and our employees. The goal is to create a constructive environment that improves bottom-line results and enables employees to perform at their best. To complement the Consequence Leadership training program, CP has developed in-house training to enhance leadership capabilities among leaders across the organization to ensure a long-term focus on our foundation to Develop People. For employees interested in further developing their leadership skills, CP also offers on-demand learning through Harvard ManageMentor. 
Succession Management
CP undergoes extensive succession planning for both executive and management level positions. We measure the retention of our most critical positions and develop potential successors to be ready to fill critical roles as soon as positions become available. Looking ahead, CP is developing succession and development goals for the many high-potential successors for all critical positions, and will begin to measure the success rate of placing emerging leaders in those key positions.
Retention & Engagement
CP’s career development programs and diverse and inclusive workplace culture help drive employee retention and engagement. In addition, we have adopted a performance-based culture, and reward employees for dedication and hard work. CP’s competitive compensation and benefits packages are benchmarked yearly to ensure they reflect changes in the market. CP offers employees a wellness and fitness subsidy program. Along with our community investment programs, CP’s employee programs and resources illustrate our dedication to our employees’ well-being and satisfaction with their careers at CP. 
CP periodically administers non-union surveys to measure employee perspectives and engagement. In 2019, we administered a new Employee Perspective survey to continue gathering actionable data regarding employee satisfaction and engagement, and to gain insight into what motivates and inspires our employees. These surveys help CP to better tailor our development and retention efforts.
Employee recognition programs are in place to celebrate wins and highlight the great work of our employees. CP’s CEO on the Spot awards, Annual Safety Awards and Broken Wheel Awards recognize good performance, heroic acts, milestones, and safety excellence with cash rewards. In addition, CP’s annual CEO Awards of Excellence and gala recognizes employees who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to exemplify CP’s five foundations and support our focus on providing superior service to our customers and driving value for our shareholders.
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity is one of our core values at CP. We believe that different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives enhance creativity and innovation and encourage diversity of thought in the workplace. Fostering an inclusive environment where all employees feel empowered to strive for and achieve success supports our high-performance culture and is integral to our growth and success as an organization. 
CP recognizes the importance of Board member diversity as a critical component of objective oversight and continuous improvement. As of December 31, 2020, women represented 46% of CP's 2020 Board Membership.
CP has regulatory requirements to report on workforce diversity representation in Canada (Employment Equity Act) and the U.S. (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). CP currently collects diversity data on the following categories: women, persons with disabilities, minorities (visible minorities), and Indigenous peoples (Canada) from employees through voluntary self-disclosure. CP continues to focus our efforts on attracting, recruiting, and developing a diverse workforce. This data is shared in various disclosures and government reporting, internally with employees and leaders as well as our Board of Directors.
