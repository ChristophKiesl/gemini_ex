In addition, the T&M segment includes data acquisition recorders, sold under the AstroNova brand, to enable our customers to acquire and record visual and electronic signal data from local and networked data streams and sensors. The recorded data is processed, analyzed and stored and presented in various visual output formats. 
 Product Identification 
 Our PI segment includes three brands: QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, and GetLabels. The segment provides a wide array of digital end-to-end product marking and identification solutions including hardware, software, and supplies for OEMs, commercial printers, and brand owners. Our customers typically label or mark products on a short to mid-size run basis and benefit from the efficiency, flexibility and cost-savings of digitally printing labels or packaging in their facility, on-demand, with the ability to accommodate multiple SKUs or variable data such as bar codes, lot numbers or expiration dates. QuickLabel brand products include tabletop printers, production-ready digital color label printers and specialty OEM printing systems for either standalone output or inline integration with existing pre-processing and finishing systems. Customers use our digital printing products in a wide variety of industries, including chemical, cosmetics, food and beverage, medical products, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and many others. TrojanLabel expands our customer market by providing a range of higher volume digital color printers, OEM printing systems and supplies that target the more demanding needs of brand owners, commercial printers, label converters, and packaging manufacturers, giving them the ability to digitally mark or encode products directly or to produce labels for post-printing applications. GetLabels brand products include a full line of media supplies, including label materials, tags, inks, toners and thermal transfer ribbons designed for optimal performance with our printing hardware, while also being compatible with a wide variety of competitive and third-party printing hardware. 
 Current QuickLabel models include a selection of professional tabletop digital color label printers. The high-speed QL-120X was built on our pioneering and successful Kiaro! platform. Introduced early in 2019, the high-performance QL-300 was the first 5-color toner-based electrophotographic tabletop production label printer in the market. In addition, our QuickLabel line of printers includes the QL-850, our next-generation wide-format inkjet color label printer, the QL-30 and QL-60 series, a family of high-end monochrome printers, and the QLS-4100 XE, a unique solution with the ability to digitally print full-color labels and tags using thermal transfer ribbon technology. 
 Our TrojanLabel portfolio includes a range of products from professional digital color label mini-presses to large-scale all-in-one inline specialty printing systems for both brand owners, OEMs and commercial printers. The T2-C, a compact, digital mini-press designed for 24/7 label production, includes numerous differentiating features for several end-use market applications. The T2-L is a narrow format digital press designed specifically for flexible packaging substrates. Beyond label printing, the T3-OPX, introduced in late 2019, allows printing directly onto a range of flat products, including cardboard, paper bags, flat wood planks and many other items using pigment inks that are water-resistant and highly resistant to UV exposure. A professional label press and finishing system, the T4, enables print, die-cut, and lamination in an all-in-one machine with a much smaller footprint than others in the market. 
 GetLabels provides a broad range of high-quality supplies for both our printers and third-party printers including label and tag materials, inks, toner and thermal transfer material, all specifically designed and constructed for a wide variety of labeling applications. Label material and substrates are carefully qualified and tested in our Rhode Island Materials Research Laboratory to ensure durability and compatibility with our QuickLabel and TrojanLabel branded products, along with a variety of third-party printers.

  The PI segment also develops and licenses various specialized software programs to design and manage labels, print images, manage and operate our printers and presses, and coordinate printing on an automated basis directly over networked systems. PI also provides worldwide training and support. 
 T&M 
 Products sold under our T&M segment are designed and manufactured for airborne printing solutions and data acquisition. Our aerospace products include flight deck printing solutions, networking hardware and specialized aerospace grade thermal paper. Our data acquisition systems are used in research and development, flight testing, missile/rocket telemetry production monitoring, power and maintenance applications. These products are sold to customers in a variety of industries, including aerospace & defense, automotive, commercial airline, energy, manufacturing and transportation, to meet their need to acquire and record data from local and networked data streams and sensors. 
 Airborne printers include our flagship ToughWriter® series used in the flight decks and cabins of military, commercial and business aircraft to print hard copies of data required for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. Examples of printed data include navigation maps, arrival and departure information, flight itineraries, weather maps, performance data, passenger data, and air traffic control data. ToughSwitch® Ethernet switches are used primarily in military aircraft and military vehicles to connect multiple computers or Ethernet devices. The airborne printers and Ethernet switches are ruggedized to comply with rigorous military and commercial flight worthiness standards for operation under extreme environmental conditions. We are currently furnishing ToughWriter airborne printers for many aircraft made by Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Lockheed, Gulfstream and others. In addition to the ToughWriter products, we manufacture other flight deck printers, including the TP/NP series, the RTP80 series and the PTA-45B series of airborne printers. The PTA-45B is subject to the Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Honeywell International, Inc. (the “Honeywell Agreement”), pursuant to which in 2017 we acquired an exclusive perpetual world-wide license to manufacture and support Honeywell’s narrow-format flight deck printers for the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 aircraft. Over time we expect customers will replace the PTA-45B printers with ToughWriter products because they have numerous technical features and functional advantages and significant weight savings. 
 Other T&M products include the TMX® all-in-one high-speed data acquisition system for applications requiring high channel counts and acquisition rates; the Daxus® DXS-100 distributed data acquisition platform; the SmartCorder® DDX-100, a portable all-in-one data acquisition system for facility maintenance and field testing; and the Everest® EV-5000 digital strip chart recording system used mainly in telemetry applications. The Daxus DXS-100 can be connected to the SmartCorder to increase channel count or networked as part of a distributed measurement system spanning vast distances. 
 Technology 
 Our core technologies are data visualization technologies that relate to (1) acquiring data, (2) conditioning the data, (3) displaying or printing the data on hard copy, monitor or electronic storage media and (4) analyzing the data. To service data visualization, we maintain technological core competencies and trade know-how concerning the subject matter peculiar to each business unit. The technological disciplines are diverse and include electronic, software, mechanical and industrial engineering aspects. Additionally, we possess engineering expertise in digital signal processing, image processing, fluidics, color theory, high-speed material handling and airworthiness design. 
Patents and Copyrights 
 We hold several product patents in the United States and in foreign countries. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our technology and brand names. We consider our intellectual property to be critical to the operation of our business. In particular, we believe that the loss of the trademarks QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, ToughWriter or ToughSwitch

  or the loss of the license provided under the Honeywell Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business taken as a whole. 
 Manufacturing and Supplies 
 We manufacture many of the products that we design and sell. Raw materials and supplies are typically available from a wide variety of sources. We manufacture many sub-assemblies and parts in-house, including certain specialty printed circuit board assemblies and harnesses, and we have extensive electronic and mechanical final assembly and test operations. Many parts not manufactured in-house are standard electronic items available from multiple sources. Other printers and parts are designed or modified by us and manufactured by outside vendors according to our specifications. We purchase certain components, assembled products and supplies used to manufacture our products from a single source or limited supplier sources. Although we believe the majority of these sole or limited source components, assembled products and supplies could be sourced elsewhere with appropriate changes in the design of our products, such design might not be feasible on a timely basis, and any interruption in these components, products or supplies could adversely affect our business. When circumstances cause us to anticipate that we may not be able to acquire such components, products or supplies on a timely basis, our practice is to procure a sufficient quantity in advance. In the past we have made such advance purchases primarily for aerospace products and in quantities that we anticipate will suffice for the life of the aircraft program for which those printers are designed. 
Marketing and Competition 
 We compete worldwide in multiple markets. Through our expanding network of manufacturing, sales and support facilities, we now do business in over 150 countries. 
 We believe we are a market leader in tabletop digital color label printing technology in the specialty printing field, a market leader in flight deck printers, and an innovator in digital color mini-press systems. In the data acquisition area, we are one of the leaders in general-purpose portable, high-speed data acquisition systems. 
 Management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. We retain our leadership position by virtue of our proprietary technology, product reputation, delivery, our channels to market, technical assistance and service to customers. The number of competitors varies by product line. Key competitive factors vary among our product lines, but include technology, quality, service and support, distribution network and breadth of product and service offerings. 
 Our Product Identification products are sold by direct field salespersons as well as independent dealers and representatives, while our Test & Measurement products are sold predominantly through direct sales and manufacturers’ representatives. In the United States, we have factory-trained direct field salespeople located throughout the country specializing in Product Identification products. We also have direct field sales or service centers in Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and the United Kingdom staffed by our own employees and dedicated third party contractors. Additionally, we utilize over 200 independent dealers and representatives selling and marketing our products in over 60 countries. 
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years. 
 Order Backlog 
 Our backlog varies regularly. It consists of a blend of orders for end-user customers, as well as original equipment manufacturer customers. Manufacturing production is designed to meet forecasted demands and built-to-order customer requirements. Accordingly, the amount of order backlog may not indicate future sales trends. Backlog at January 31, 2021 and 2020 was $22.5 million and $25.2 million, respectively. 
 Employees 
 As of January 31, 2021, we employed 327 people full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 230 were in the United States, 78 in Europe, 10 in Canada, seven in Asia and two in Mexico.

  None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement; except for our employees in France, where collective bargaining agreements are generally required by local regulations. 
 Successful execution of our business strategy depends on our ability to retain several key employees in both individual contributor and management roles. We continuously assess the risk of losing our key employees through regular communications, engagement surveys and assessments in the labor market. Our retention strategy is focused on ensuring competitive compensation packages, career and professional development, leadership coaching and other actions to improve overall engagement with our key employees. 
 Culture 
 We have ingrained a strong and definable company culture that shapes the way we operate and engage with stakeholders and employees. Our culture consists of four key components: 

• | A powerful set of core values, including: Customer First, One Global Team, Innovation, Continuous Improvement and Building Shareholder Value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The AstroNova Operating System (AOS), the comprehensive business management process which helps us manage the business to achieve continuous improvements in quality, delivery, cost, and growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A commitment to operating with integrity and compliance to ensure business is conducted in an honest, legal, and environmentally responsible manner.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A passionate commitment to quality that drives our goal to achieve zero defects and understand the changing needs and expectations of our customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our core values guide our employees’ behavior and dictate the way our business is conducted. These core values are reinforced during new hire orientation, ongoing engagement surveys, leadership development, and team development activities, and are also demonstrated through teamwork, leadership, and everyday interactions. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 We believe that our culture and core values are strengthened through diversity and inclusion. Our diversity initiatives include—but are not limited to—our practices and policies on recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; transfers; social and recreational programs; layoffs; terminations; and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of gender and diversity equity. These initiatives include periodic evaluation of our workforce demographics as compared to the demographics in the workforce market, and an affirmative effort to attract, recruit, retain and train a diverse workforce that is representative of the populations in the regions in which we do business. 
Other Information 
 Our business is not seasonal in nature. However, our revenue is impacted by the size of certain individual transactions, which can cause fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter.
