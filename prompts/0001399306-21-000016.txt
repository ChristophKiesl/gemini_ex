Satel Group merged with Simlatus Corporation (SIML or Company) on November 13, 2018 and is the premier provider of DirecTV to high-rise apartments, condominiums and large commercial office buildings in the San Francisco metropolitan area and is now expanding both their DirecTV and Internet services across the Bay Area. Simlatus continues to manufacture its own proprietary systems for major broadcast studios, such as Warner Bros., Fox News, CBS, and DirecTV. Its video technology supports the major system used for underwater oil exploration in the world.
 
Simlatus has been selling audio-video system technology for approximately 20 years, manufactures its own product line of commercial audio and video systems that offers advanced applications utilized in the commercial and government broadcast industry and other industries where such applications are required. The Company products are sold through a global network of established broadcast audio/video equipment distributors, many of whom have been selling Simlatus products for many years.
 
Simlatus Corporation was initially incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Sunberta Resources Inc. on November 15, 2006, as a mining and exploration of mineral claims business. On November 18, 2009, the Company changed its name to Grid Petroleum Corp. and continued with the mining and exploration of mineral claims in Alberta, Canada, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, England, and the United States.
 
On March 9, 2016, Grid Petroleum Corp. entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement) with RJM and Associates, LLC, a California limited liability company (RJM) whereby RJM‟s owners became the directors of the Company and were to be issued $6,250,000 worth of the Companys stock; $5,000,000 of Restricted Common Stock 90 days from the date of this agreement and $1,250,000 of Preferred Series-A Shares of the Companys Preferred Stock.

The Companys transaction with RJM has been treated as a reverse recapitalization of the Company, with the Company (the legal acquirer of RJM) considered the accounting acquiree, and RJM, whose management took control of the Company (the legal acquiree of the Company) considered the accounting acquirer. The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with the transaction. All costs related to the transaction are being charged to operations as incurred. The $6,250,000 worth of shares of Company stock, to be issued in conjunction with the transaction, was presented as a liability until such time that the shares were issued, and the liability reduced. The historical financial statements include the operations of the accounting acquirer for all periods presented.
 
On March 25, 2016, the Company approved a name change to Simlatus Corporation, stock symbol SIML, which was executed on April 4, 2016. The new name change better describes the Companys new business and revenues from selling commercial broadcast equipment on a global basis. Simlatus Corporation develops, manufactures, markets, and owns proprietary advanced broadcast equipment and software. These systems have been sold worldwide over the past 20 years to some of the most recognized, major broadcast companies in the Television Industry.
 
The Company currently sells approximately 55 different commercial audio/video products and is preparing to market its newest audio/video product referred to as SyncPal™. In addition to the Companys traditional line of audio/video products, it has commenced the research & development of its Immersive Broadcast System, referred to as the Simlatus-IBS™. The Simlatus-IBS™ will include commercial augmented reality and virtual reality applications for studio engineers. These applications, both hardware and software, will allow the customer to control and manage the studio audio/video systems from anywhere in the world. These products are being developed to serve a market segment that is presently being strongly embraced by consumers and is forecasted, by some of the most widely recognized tech companies in the world, as becoming a multi-billion-dollar market in the near future. The Market Analysis and IP Portfolio will include new patents specifically developed for these products and owned by the Company.

In regard to Satel Group Inc., the global Internet audience continues to grow steadily, with the worldwide base of broadband Internet users (including fixed and wireless) in the 3.2 billion range as 2016 began. This vast base of high-speed Internet users encourages businesses to innovate in order to offer an ever-evolving array of online services. Sectors that are growing very rapidly online include the sale of entertainment products, event tickets, travel, apparel, and consumer electronics.
 
The most powerful trends on the Internet include access via wireless devices, the migration of entertainment to the web and cloud-based software-as-a-service. Today, consumers are more focused than ever on finding the best prices, as consumer attitudes and shopping habits changed dramatically as a result of the 2007-09 recession. Consequently, e-commerce firms that offer high value at low prices are well-positioned to prosper.
 
Telecommunication, or telecom, companies provide fixed and mobile voice, text, and data transmission to consumers, small businesses, enterprises, and government entities. Traditionally, telecom companies drove revenue mainly by providing voice calling, text messaging, and Internet connectivity through wire line or landline connections by offered its services to both consumers and businesses. Now, the business is driven wireless along with wired internet, data, and business solutions. In wire line, telecom companies sell voice and data services to customers via traditional landline phones and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol). For the Internet, they give solutions ranging from basic connectivity over the usual DSL (digital subscriber line) to high-speed connections. In home entertainment, they provide television services through IPTV (Internet Protocol television). They also sell advanced services in video conferencing, high bandwidth dedicated lines, and secured communication systems to their larger customers.
 
Although telecom companies provide voice and data services to consumers and businesses, the nature of these services differs significantly between the two customer segments. While residential customers mainly use wireless services, businesses use wire line to get high-capacity broadband and advanced communications services. Also, telecom companies rent their facilities or networks—providing wholesale data and communication access—to other carriers of communication services.
 
Key companies in the US include AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), and Sprint (S) which are the large integrated, publicly trade telecom companies that provide wireless and wire line services, while T-Mobile (TMUS) is a listed national wireless operator. Wire line players—like CenturyLink (CTL), Frontier Communications (FTR), and Windstream Holdings (WIN)—are some of the other key regional telecom companies in the US. A wire line network includes interlinked connection and redistribution systems that supports information—like voice and data—to travel electronically. Traditional, local, and long distance telephone systems that supported voice calls, messaging, and fax were the primary wire line services that transmitted services over a network of copper wires and switches. The wires and switches connected calls between users mostly using a copper infrastructure connecting traditional landlines and pay phones. Now, with the backbone of the network being fiber optics, they support a broadband network capable of delivering VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), Internet, TV services, and managed private communications. Broadband infrastructure is recognized as a critical resource for economic development. Most countries, across the globe have strategic plans in place—like the National Broadband Plan—to expand and develop their Broadband network to support a broad range of enhanced communications and entertainment services.
 
Since inception in 2003, Satel operations have primarily consisted of providing DirecTV services to high-rise apartments, condominiums and to business in commercial buildings by investing in the equipment and employing the trained personnel required to maintain those services in the City of San Francisco. In 2014, Satel began expanding their services to provide Internet services in the same high-rise buildings in which they already provide DirecTV. Our business model now incorporates three-phases that detail the steps we intend to take to expand our services by launching and marketing an expanded mix of products.
 
Phase 1: Upgrading as necessary and or installing an enhanced coaxial and wireless internet network in buildings already under contract with Satel to provide existing customers access, through proprietary systems either manufactured or distributed by Simlatus local, off air television programming at a minimum monthly charge, while supporting faster internet speeds at less cost to the customer to attract new residential and commercial customers.

Phase 2: Enhancing our website to include point of sale transactions, allow subscribers to manage their accounts and purchase additional services online.
 
Phase 3: Continue to obtain long term contracts to provide services in both existing and new high rise complexes throughout the Bay Area to grow our customer base and support the increase in customer usage volume with the enhanced wireless internet network and website.
 
Currently the company provides services to approximately 18,108 high rise condominium and apartment dwellings located in 170 buildings that have been wired by Satel to receive satellite delivered television entertainment through the companys licensing agreement with DirecTV.
 
Satels current revenue is from the combination of individual DirecTV subscribers, DirecTV services from commercial office buildings plus Internet subscribers and contracted upgrades of commercial entertainment systems.
 
One customer contract includes a monthly service fee while the other contract requires no fee. Both contracts include the DirecTV MDU Equipment Lease Agreement, which is required by DirecTV for each new customer, along with options for No Commitment‟, One Year Commitment‟, or Two Year Commitment‟. The Satel No Fee‟ customers are properties we acquired from other companies that were not paying a monthly fee to Satel. The Satel Fee‟ customers are in properties we acquired directly with long term contracts that pay a monthly fee to Satel. The Satel Terms and Conditions‟ provide for a disclosure of rates and charges, a warranty that covers equipment use, repair and replacement, and miscellaneous provisions that provides disclosure regarding jurisdiction laws and rights for the customer. The DirecTV MDU Equipment Lease Agreement provides additions customer rights and warranties.
 
The companys internet service is less expensive than AT&T, Google, and Comcast, which currently offer Gigabit‟ as their top Internet service, while most customers buy a much slower and less expensive service under a 100 MB. Satels application of HPNA technology using coaxial cable to deliver Internet, provides download speeds of 200Mb-500Mb, with unlimited downloads for a cost less than those fees charged by other carriers for the same speeds. The company believes that there is a good and marketable monthly Internet service in the $40-$45 range. Satel can also combine local, off air channels, whereas the other OTT providers do not.
 
We will continue to market our product to new building owners and management companies using our direct B2B campaign as well as to contact those architects, engineering firms and other decision makers involved with new high rise construction in the Bay Area. Our CEO, Richard Hylen, has established long-term relationships with owners, builders, management companies, managers, and other service providers to introduce our product and create our initial sales contact. Our CEO has extensive experience in marketing both entertainment and Internet services and believes that the marketing of our products directly to consumers would not have the same potential for increased sales that it would have without the ongoing support of established building managers.
