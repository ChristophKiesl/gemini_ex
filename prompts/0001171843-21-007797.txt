Description of Business
 
Clearfield is focused on providing fiber management, fiber protection, and fiber delivery products that accelerate the turn-up of gigabit speed bandwidth to residential homes, businesses, and network infrastructure in the wireline and wireless access network.  We offer a broad portfolio of fiber products that allow service providers to build fiber networks faster, meet service delivery demands, and align build costs with take rates.
 
Our products allow our customers to connect twice as many homes in their Fiber to the Home (“FTTH”) builds by using fewer resources in less time.  Our products speed up the time to revenue for our service provider customers in Multiple Dwelling Units (“MDUs”) and Multiple Tenant Units (“MTUs”) by reducing the amount of labor and materials needed to provide gigabit service.  Our products help make business services more profitable through faster building access, easier reconfiguration and quicker services turn-up.  Finally, Clearfield is removing barriers to wireless 4G/5G small cell, Cloud Radio Access Network (“C-RAN”), and distributed antenna system (“DAS”) deployments through better fiber management, test access, and fiber protection.
 
Substantially all of the final build and assembly is completed at Clearfield’s plants in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota and Mexico, with manufacturing support from a network of domestic and global manufacturing partners.  Clearfield specializes in producing these products on both a quick-turn and scheduled delivery basis. 
 
Products
 
Product development for Clearfield’s product line program has mainly been conducted internally.  We believe that the communication industry environment is constantly evolving, and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes.  Our focus is to analyze the environment and technology and work to develop products that simplify our customers’ business by developing innovative high-quality products utilizing modular design wherever possible.  Research and development are reflected in Selling, General, & Administrative expenses.

FieldSmart® is a series of panels, cabinets, wall boxes and other enclosures that house the Clearview components to provide a consistent design from the inside plant of the telco’s “central office” or cable television’s “head-end,” all the way through the outside plant to the access network to within the home or business.  The central building block of FieldSmart is the patented technology surrounding the Clearview® Cassette. 
 
WaveSmart® optical components are integrated for signal coupling, splitting, termination, multiplexing, demultiplexing and attenuation for a seamless integration within our fiber management platform.  The products are built and tested for harsh environments to meet the strictest industry standards ensuring customers trouble-free performance in extreme outside plant conditions.
 
Active Cabinets (“ODC”), Fiber Active Cabinet (“FAC”), and FiberFlex product lines feature either fully integrated, fully engineered cabinets equipped with specific active electronics configurations or universal cabinets ready for mounting other electronic equipment.  This product line features Clearfield’s fiber management solutions housing the Clearview Cassette. The FieldSmart® FAC and FiberFlex product line of outdoor active cabinets feature multiple sizes for universal configurations of electronic equipment.
 
FieldShield® is a patented fiber pathway and protection method aimed at reducing the cost of broadband deployment.  FieldShield starts with a ruggedized microduct designed to support all aerial, direct bury, and inside plant “last mile” needs.  FieldShield Microduct is strong enough to be placed using traditional methods of boring and plowing, leveraging existing conduit placement equipment, as well as newer, less disruptive technologies such as micro trenching or saw cutting.
 
YOURx® Platform uses a modular, building block approach with tool-less system design focusing on the fiber drop to the customer.  The YOURx platform consists of hardened terminals, test access points, and multiple drop cable options designed for the most challenging portion of the access network across all fiber drop cable media. 
 
CraftSmart® is a full line of optical protection field enclosures, extending Clearfield presence in the fiber industry.  The CraftSmart Fiber Protection Pedestals (“FPP”) and CraftSmart Fiber Protection Vaults (“FPV”) are integrated solutions, optimized to house FieldSmart products at the last mile access point of the network in above-grade or below-grade installations.
 
StreetSmart® is a portfolio of fiber management products engineered from street-proven experience. The StreetSmart portfolio enables easy access to fibers while maintaining fiber management and fiber routing design principles.
 
Fiber and Copper assemblies - Clearfield manufactures high quality with an industry-standard or customer-specified configuration.  In addition, Clearfield’s engineering services team works alongside the engineering design departments of our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers to design and manufacture custom solutions for both in-the-box as well as network connectivity assemblies specific to that customer’s product line.
 
Markets and Customers
 
Clearfield’s products are sold across broadband service providers, which we categorize as National Carrier (wireless/wireless national telco carriers (Tier 1)), Community Broadband (Tier 2 and 3 telco carriers, utilities, municipalities, and alternative carriers), Multiple System Operators (cable television), International (primarily Central/Latin America and Canada), and Legacy build-to-print copper and fiber assemblies (primarily contract manufacturing).  The Company’s products are sold direct to customers through the Company’s sales force as well as through authorized distributors. In addition, the Company uses manufacturing sales representatives and sales agents for customer and geography specific needs.

FTTP
 
Fiber to the Premise (also called Fiber to the Home) is a means of delivering the highest possible level of bandwidth directly to the user.  The Company’s sales and marketing efforts have principally been focused on the U.S., with investments in Canada and Central/Latin America.
FTTB
 
Fiber to the Business is principally for Multiple System Operators (cable television) and wireless/wireless national telco carriers (Tier 1) to penetrate the business marketplace.
 
FTT-Cell site
 
Fiber to the Cell site is the trend in which wireless service providers enhance their coverage for bandwidth. Currently, the majority of these cell sites are served by fiber.
DAS
 
A distributed-antenna system, or DAS, is a network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a geographic area or structure. 
C-RAN
 
C-RAN uses front-haul fiber to connect the Remote Radio Head (“RRH”) to a Baseband Unit (“BBU”) located in a datacenter (i.e., the cloud).  C-RAN is an evolution of RAN cellular architecture that traditionally used fiber to backhaul signals from the BBU at a tower back to the mobile core network.
Build to Print
 
In addition to a proprietary product line designed for the broadband service provider marketplace, Clearfield provides contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers requiring copper and fiber cable assemblies built to their specification.
Competition
 
Competitors to the FieldSmart product lines include, but are not limited to, products offered by Corning Cabling Systems, Inc., OFS (Furukawa Electric North America, Inc.), AFL Telecommunications (a subsidiary of Fujikura Ltd.), Fujikura Ltd., Nokia, and CommScope, Inc.  Competitors to the CraftSmart product line include products offered by Emerson Network Power, a subsidiary of Vertiv Co., and Charles Industries, Ltd., a subsidiary of Amphenol.  Competitors to FieldShield include products offered by PPC Broadband, Inc.  Nearly all of these firms are substantially larger than Clearfield and as a result may be able to procure necessary components and labor at much lower prices.  Clearfield believes that it has a competitive advantage with customers who can leverage the cost savings the Clearview Cassette can provide and those who require quick-turn, high-performance customized products, and that it is at a competitive disadvantage with customers who principally seek large volume commodity products.
Sources of Materials and Contract Manufacturing Services
 
Numerous purchased materials, components, and labor are used in the manufacturing of the Company’s products.  Most of these are available from multiple suppliers.  However, some components and third-party contract manufacturing services are purchased from a single or a limited number of suppliers.  The loss of access to some components and third-party contract manufacturing services could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and on our financial performance. 
Major Customers and Financial Information about Geographic Areas 
 
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had two customers that comprised 28% and 30% of net sales, respectively. Both of these customers are distributors. These major customers, like our other customers, purchase our products from time to time through purchase orders, and we do not have any agreements that obligate these major customers to purchase products in the future from us.
 
    3 

  

As of September 30, 2021, one customer accounted for 17% of accounts receivable. This customer is a telecommunications service provider within our Community Broadband market. As of September 30, 2020, two customers accounted for 25% of accounts receivable. Both of these customers were distributors. 
 
The Company allocates sales from external customers to geographic areas based on the location to which the product is transported.  Sales outside the United States are principally to customers in countries in the Caribbean, in Canada, and Central and South America.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
As of September 30, 2021, we had 30 patents granted and multiple patent applications pending both inside and outside the United States. These patents begin to expire in 2028. We have also developed and are using multiple trademarks and logos to market and promote our products.                 Sales Backlog
 
Sales backlog reflects purchase order commitments for our products received from customers that have yet to be fulfilled. The Company had a backlog of $66,365,000, and $10,663,000 as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At September 30, 2021, most of the Company’s backlog orders are scheduled to ship within the next six months.
Seasonality
 
We are affected by the seasonal trends in the industries we serve.  We typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and second fiscal year quarters, primarily due to customer budget cycles, deployment schedules of outdoor products, some customer geographical concentrations as well as standard vacation and holiday calendars.  Sales have usually reach a seasonal peak in our third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of September 30, 2021, the Company had approximately 250 U.S. based full-time employees, which include approximately 135 office personnel and approximately 115 manufacturing personnel. The substantial majority of these employees work out of our Brooklyn Park, Minnesota headquarters. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreement. The Company’s office personnel are comprised of sales, marketing, engineering, and administrative personnel. The manufacturing personnel include both individuals directly involved in the manufacturing of our products, as well as warehouse and operations supervisory personnel.  Certain positions within our organization require industry specific technical knowledge. We have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel for these positions and the Company has training programs that allow manufacturing and other technical employees to develop the necessary skillset for their roles. Our manufacturing personnel currently work in two shifts as needed at our Brooklyn Park facility. We also employ seasonal, part-time employees and independent contractors. The Company contracts for approximately 400 personnel in its Mexico facilities through a Maquiladora agreement and these manufacturing personnel are also currently working in two shifts as needed. All manufacturing employees and the Company’s production operations are monitored with metrics and goals based on quality, productivity, and ability to meet shipping promise dates. As a measure of quality, we focus on First Pass Yield (“FPY”), which is calculated as the percentage of product that meets all performance criteria upon first completion from our manufacturing floor and requires no rework. The Company’s target for FPY ranges from 92-99%, depending on key manufacturing steps and the product line being produced. We also measure our On-Time Delivery (“OTD”) which is determined by the Company’s ability to ship product on the date necessary, accounting for standard shipping times, in order to meet the agreed upon delivery date with our customers. The Company’s OTD target is a minimum of 95%. This metric is important as the Company has taken a strategic approach to be able to offer low industry lead times for our customers.

Climate Change
 
Certain government and regulatory bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change.
 
The majority of our manufacturing operations calls for compiling raw material and other purchased components from suppliers. As part of our operations, we focus on minimizing scrap and other waste and look to recycle and salvage this scrap wherever possible. Any new regulation of emissions may result in additional costs to our suppliers which may be passed on to us. In addition, the physical impacts of climate change and other natural events, including increasing frequency of extreme weather events, changes in weather patterns, drought, rising ocean and temperature levels, earthquakes and tsunamis may impact our manufacturing operations as well as our customers, and suppliers. These potential physical effects may increase costs, cause delays or shortages in components required to produce our products or cause delays in the shipment of our products to customers.
 
Developments Regarding, and Actions Taken in Response to, COVID-19
 
Under U.S. federal and state guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clearfield’s operations are classified as part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) critical infrastructure sector and similar categorization in Minnesota. In March 2020, we transitioned our corporate employees at our Brooklyn Park headquarters to remote work arrangements and they currently continue primarily working remote. In accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”) guidelines, we implemented and have continued health and safety measures for the production staff that remain onsite at our Brooklyn Park facility. We have maintained our manufacturing capacity in Brooklyn Park with these personnel at near historic levels. Similarly, we have implemented the recommended health and safety measures for the production staff that remains onsite at our Tijuana, Mexico manufacturing facilities. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has closely monitored the operations and staffing levels at its Brooklyn Park facility and its two manufacturing facilities in Tijuana, Mexico.
 
Due to the risks to timely supply of materials to our facilities, we have taken multiple actions to ensure sufficient safety stock inventory levels at both our Minnesota and Mexico facilities. Additionally, we made the decision to maximize the availability of all product lines at all three of our plants by assuring that each location can manufacture across our broad product portfolio. These actions, combined with our historic practice of dual sourcing most of our components, has positioned us to meet our obligations to customers and to fulfill our sales backlog. However, in the event of serious border restrictions or border delays, continuing or worsening component material shortages, supply chain transportation delays, or other serious disruption in our supply chain, we may experience diminished or temporarily suspended operations, longer lead times than typical for product deliveries, or temporarily suspended product deliveries, which would result in delayed or reduced revenue from the affected orders in production and higher operating costs. In addition, due to the unprecedented lead-times and challenges in the global supply chain, we are working with our customers to place longer lead-time purchase orders to ensure availability of components and materials from our supply chain. Based on current supply chain dynamics, lead times have stretched to 8 to 10 weeks for certain product categories. Over the remainder of calendar 2021 and into 2022, the Company expects to work to manage lead times to more historic levels from receipt of purchase order.
 
The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion of the impact of COVID-19 as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.
