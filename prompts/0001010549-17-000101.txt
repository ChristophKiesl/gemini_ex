Background
 
Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc., an operating company, was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on February 25, 2008.
 
Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. has never declared bankruptcy, has never been in receivership, and has never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since becoming incorporated, Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations.  Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. is not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it has a specific business plan or purpose and is currently operational. Since our inception, we have been engaged in business activities, including researching the industry, developing our advertising platforms, performing due diligence regarding potential customers most suitable for our Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. services and identifying future business platforms.
 
Currently, Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. has two officers and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning, development and operational duties.

Business of Issuer
 
Our services are in the U.S. under the brand name Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc.  We have implemented the Phase 1 build out of our business by providing consumers a simplified way of managing their credit.  Although we are a development stage Company, we currently generate minimal revenues from operations.  Our services, while not technically difficult to provide, must be continually developed to provide our clients the most current platforms. By using our proprietary software system, a client can perform affordable credit management with an automated process and clearly understand the credit scoring (FICO) system currently used the country.
 
In addition, we are offering affiliate websites that will give affiliates a custom home page for them to use as a portal for their customers. This is an excellent profit center and gives us high retention for those affiliates.
 
Our technology will focus initially on two channels:
 

Retail. End users who would traditionally have to buy a kit or hire a credit management specialist to do this for them. The drawback to most self-help methods is that it usually doesn’t work, and in some cases makes the situation worse. Our software, along with video tutorials, makes it easy for a client to fail. The process is the same for everyone, why would you pay hundreds or thousands if you could do it yourself for minimal expense.
