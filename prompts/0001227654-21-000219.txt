SALT SEGMENT
Overview
Salt is indispensable and enormously versatile with thousands of reported uses. In addition, there are no known cost-effective alternatives for most high-volume uses. Through the use of effective mining techniques and efficient production processes, we leverage our high-grade salt deposits, which are among the most extensive in the world. Further, many of our Salt segment assets are in locations that are logistically favorable to our core markets. Our strategy for this segment is to focus on driving profitability from every ton we produce through cost efficiency as well as commercial and operational execution.
Through our Salt segment, we produce, market and sell salt (sodium chloride) and magnesium chloride in North America and sodium chloride in the U.K. Our Salt products include rock salt, mechanically-evaporated salt, solar-evaporated salt, brine magnesium chloride and flake magnesium chloride. While we also purchase potassium chloride (“KCl”) and calcium chloride to sell as finished products or to blend with sodium chloride to produce specialty products, sodium chloride represents the vast majority of the products we produce, market and sell. In 2020, the Salt segment accounted for approximately 57% of our sales (see Part II, Item 8, Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial information). 
Our Salt products are used in a wide variety of applications, including as a deicer for roadways, consumer and professional use, as an ingredient in chemical production, for water treatment, human and animal nutrition and for a variety of other consumer and industrial uses.
Historical demand for salt has remained relatively stable during periods of rising prices and through a variety of economic cycles due to its relatively low cost and diverse number of end uses. As a result, our cash flows from our Salt segment are not materially impacted by economic cycles. However, demand for deicing salt products is primarily affected by the number and intensity of snow events and temperatures in our service territories.

Salt Industry Overview
In our primary markets, we estimate that the consumption of highway deicing rock salt in North America, including rock salt used in chemical manufacturing processes, is approximately 39 million tons per year, assuming average winter weather conditions, while the consumer and industrial market is approximately 10 million tons per year. In the U.K., we estimate that the consumption of highway deicing salt is approximately 2 million tons per year, assuming average winter weather conditions. We also estimate that salt production in the U.S. has increased at a historical average rate of approximately 1% per year, although there have been recent fluctuations above and below this average driven primarily by winter weather variability.
Salt prices vary according to purity, end use and variations in refining and packaging processes. Management estimates that salt prices in the U.S. have increased at a historical average rate of approximately 3% - 4% per year, although there have been recent fluctuations above and below this average. Due to salt’s relatively low production cost, transportation and handling costs tend to be a significant component of the total delivered cost, which makes logistics management and customer service key competitive factors in the industry. The high relative cost associated with transportation of salt tends to favor producers located nearest to customers.
Processing Methods
As of December 31, 2020, salt mining, other production activities and packaging are conducted at 11 of our facilities. The three processing methods we use to produce salt are described below.
Underground Rock Salt Mining - We produce most of the salt we sell through underground mining. In North America, we use a combination of continuous mining and drill and blast techniques. At our Winsford, U.K. mine, we utilize continuous mining techniques. We introduced continuous mining at our Goderich, Ontario mine in 2012 and shifted all of our Goderich mine production to this technology at the end of 2017. Mining machinery moves salt from the salt face to conveyor belts, which transport the salt to the mill center where it is crushed and screened. It is then hoisted to the surface where the processed salt is loaded onto shipping vessels, railcars or trucks. The primary power sources for each of our rock salt mines are electricity and diesel fuel. Rock salt is sold in our highway deicing product lines and for numerous applications in our consumer and industrial product lines. 

Mechanical Evaporation - Mechanical evaporation involves creating salt-saturated brine from brine wells in underground salt deposits and subjecting this salt-saturated brine to vacuum pressure and heat to precipitate and crystallize salt. The primary power sources used for this process are natural gas and electricity. The resulting product has a high purity and uniform physical shape. Mechanically evaporated salt is primarily sold through our consumer and industrial salt product lines.
Solar Evaporation - Solar evaporation is used in areas of the world where high-salinity brine is available and weather conditions provide for a high natural evaporation rate. Salt-saturated brine is pumped into a series of large open ponds where sun and wind evaporate the water and crystallize the salt, which is then mechanically harvested and processed through washing, drying and screening. We produce solar salt at the Great Salt Lake near Ogden, Utah and sell it through both our consumer and industrial and our highway deicing product lines. We also produce magnesium chloride using solar evaporation. After sodium chloride and potassium-rich salts precipitate from brine, a concentrated magnesium chloride brine solution remains, which becomes the raw material we use to produce several magnesium chloride products. We primarily sell these products in our Salt segment through our consumer and industrial and highway deicing product lines.
Operations and Facilities
Canada - We produce finished Salt products at four locations in Canada. Rock salt mined at our Goderich mine serves highway deicing markets and consumer and industrial markets in Canada and the Great Lakes region of the U.S., principally through a series of depots located around the Great Lakes and through our packaging facilities. Mechanically evaporated salt used for our consumer and industrial product lines is produced at three of our facilities strategically located throughout Canada: Amherst, Nova Scotia in Eastern Canada; Goderich, Ontario in Central Canada; and Unity, Saskatchewan in Western Canada.
United States - We produce finished Salt products at three locations in the U.S. Our Cote Blanche, Louisiana rock salt mine primarily serves highway deicing customers through a series of depots located along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers (and their major tributaries) and chemical and agricultural customers in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. Our solar evaporation facility located near Ogden, Utah principally serves the Midwestern and Western U.S. consumer and industrial markets, provides salt for highway deicing and chemical applications and produces magnesium chloride, which is used in deicing, dust control and unpaved road surface stabilization applications. The production capacity for solar-evaporated salt at our Ogden facility is currently only limited by demand. Mechanically evaporated salt for our U.S. consumer and industrial customers is produced at our Lyons, Kansas plant. We also operate three salt packaging facilities located in Illinois, Minnesota and New York.

COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

United Kingdom - Our Winsford rock salt mine in Northwest England, near Manchester, serves the U.K. highway deicing market, primarily in England and Wales.
Our current estimated production capacity is approximately 16.2 million tons of salt per year. The following table shows the estimated annual production capacity and type of salt produced at each of our owned or leased production locations as of December 31, 2020:

Location | Annual Production Capacity(a)(tons) | Product Type 
North America | | 
Goderich, Ontario Mine | 8.0 million | Rock Salt 
Cote Blanche, Louisiana Mine | 2.9 million | Rock Salt 
Ogden, Utah Plant: | | 
Salt(b) | 1.5 million | Solar Salt 
Magnesium Chloride(c) | 750,000 | Magnesium Chloride
Lyons, Kansas Plant | 450,000 | Evaporated Salt 
Unity, Saskatchewan Plant | 140,000 | Evaporated Salt 
Goderich, Ontario Plant | 140,000 | Evaporated Salt 
Amherst, Nova Scotia Plant | 130,000 | Evaporated Salt 
United Kingdom | | 
Winsford, Cheshire Mine | 2.2 million | Rock Salt 

(a)Annual production capacity is our estimate of the tons that could be produced based on design capacity, assuming optimization of our operations, including our facilities, equipment and workforce. Incremental equipment, labor or other costs may be required to achieve these production capacity estimates. As we continue our efforts to optimize and refine our production methods, we will update our estimates if necessary.
(b)Solar salts deposited annually substantially exceed the amount converted into finished products. The amount presented here represents an approximate average amount produced based on recent market demand.
(c)The magnesium chloride amount includes both brine and flake.
Actual annual Salt production volume levels may vary from the annual production capacity shown in the table above due to a number of factors, including variations in the winter weather conditions which impact demand for highway and consumer deicing products, the quality of the reserves and the nature of the geologic formation that we are mining at a particular time, unplanned downtime due to safety concerns, incidents and mechanical failures, and other operating conditions. The chart below shows annual Salt production volumes, including magnesium chloride, at our owned and leased production locations:
* Excludes solar salt harvested at our Ogden facility that is not converted into finished product and salt processed at our packaging facilities.
Our production facilities have access to vast mineral deposits. At all of our production locations, we estimate the recoverable salt reserves to last at least several more decades at current production rates and capacities. Our rights to extract those minerals may be contractually limited by geographic boundaries or time. We believe that we will be able to continue extending these agreements, as we have in the past, at commercially reasonable terms without incurring substantial costs or material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions, thereby allowing us to fully utilize our existing mineral rights.
Our underground mines in Canada (Goderich, Ontario), the U.S. (Cote Blanche, Louisiana) and the U.K. (Winsford, Cheshire) make up 85% of our salt production capacity as of December 31, 2020. Each of these mines is operated with modern 

7 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

mining equipment and utilizes subsurface improvements, such as vertical shaft lift systems, milling and crushing facilities, maintenance and repair shops and extensive raw materials handling systems. 
We own the mine site at Goderich, Ontario and maintain a mineral lease for mineral reserves with the provincial government, which grants us the right to mine salt at this site. This mineral lease expires in 2022, and we have an option to renew the lease until 2043 after demonstrating to the lessor that the mine’s useful life is greater than the term of the lease. The Cote Blanche mine is operated under land and mineral leases with third-party landowners who grant us the right to mine salt. The mine site and salt reserves at the Winsford mine are owned. We regularly perform mineral reserve studies at our mines to confirm the remaining mineral reserves. The table below reflects current information about our mines:

Mine | Years in operation | Remaining reserve* | Remaining mine life*
Goderich | 61 years | 541.3 million tons | 83 years 
Cote Blanche | 55 years | 303.8 million tons | 101 years 
Winsford | 175 years | 28.0 million tons | 28 years 

*Based upon the average rates of production used in the latest mineral study. 
Our mineral interests are amortized on an individual mine basis over estimated useful lives not exceeding 99 years primarily using the units-of-production method. Our mineral reserve estimates of the remaining tons are derived from periodic reserve studies completed by third-party geological engineering firms. Our mineral reserve estimates and the third-party reserve studies are based on many factors, including the area and volume covered by our mining rights, assumptions regarding our extraction rates based upon an expectation of operating the mines on a long-term basis and the quality of in-place reserves. Established criteria for proven and probable reserves are primarily applicable to mining deposits of discontinuous metal, where both the presence of ore and its variable grade need to be precisely identified. However, the massive continuous nature of evaporative deposits, such as salt deposits, requires proportionately less data for the same degree of confidence in mineral reserves, both in terms of quantity and quality. Reserve studies performed by third-party geological engineering firms suggest that most of our mineral reserves are characterized as probable mineral reserves, with smaller quantities as proven mineral reserves. We have classified our mineral reserves as probable reserves.
In 2012, we acquired mining rights to approximately 100 million tons of salt reserves in the Chilean Atacama Desert. This reserve estimate is based upon an initial report. We will need to complete a feasibility study before we proceed with the development of this project to ensure our salt reserves are probable. The development of this project will require significant infrastructure to establish extraction and logistics capabilities. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in these rights totaled $7.5 million. 
We package our Salt products at three additional Company-owned and operated facilities. We estimate that our annual combined packaging capacity at these three facilities is 275,000 tons. Our packaging capacity is based on our estimate of the tons that can be packaged at these facilities assuming a normal amount of scheduled down-time and operation of our facilities under normal working conditions, including staffing levels. We have the capability to significantly increase our annual packaging capacity by increasing our staffing levels in response to demand. 
Products and Sales
We sell our Salt products through our highway deicing product line (which includes brine magnesium chloride as well as rock salt treated with this mineral) and our consumer and industrial product line (which includes salt as well as products containing magnesium chloride and calcium chloride in both pure form and blended with salt). 
Highway deicing, including salt sold to chemical customers, constituted 61% of our 2020 Salt segment gross sales. Our principal customers are states, provinces, counties, municipalities and road maintenance contractors that purchase bulk deicing salt, both treated and untreated, for ice control on public roadways. Highway deicing salt in North America is sold primarily through an annual tendered bid contract process with governmental entities, as well as through multi-year contracts, with price, product quality and delivery capabilities as the primary competitive market factors. Some sales also occur through negotiated sales contracts with third-party customers, particularly in the U.K. Since transportation costs are a relatively large portion of the cost to deliver products to customers, locations of salt sources and distribution networks also play a significant role in the ability of suppliers to cost-effectively serve customers. We have an extensive network of approximately 80 depots for storage and distribution of highway deicing salt in North America. The majority of these depots are located on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and Ohio River systems. Deicing salt product from our Ogden facility supplies customers in the Western and upper Midwest regions of the U.S. Treated rock salt, which is typically rock salt with magnesium chloride brine and organic materials that enhance the salt’s performance, is sold throughout our markets.
We believe our production capability at our Winsford mine and favorable logistics position enhance our ability to meet the U.K.’s winter demands. Due to our strong position, we are viewed as a key supplier by the U.K.’s Highways Agency. In the U.K., approximately 75% of our highway deicing customers have multi-year contracts.
Winter weather variability is the most significant factor affecting salt sales for deicing applications, because mild winters reduce the need for salt used in ice and snow control. On average, over the last three years, approximately two-thirds of our 

8 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

deicing product sales occurred during the North American and European winter months of November through March. The vast majority of our North American deicing sales are made in Canada and the Midwestern U.S. where inclement weather during the winter months causes dangerous road conditions. In keeping with industry practice, we stockpile salt to meet estimated requirements for the next winter season. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for more information on the seasonality of our Salt segment results.
Our principal chemical customers are producers of intermediate chemical products used in the production of vinyls and other chemicals, pulp and paper, as well as water treatment and a variety of other industrial uses. We typically have multi-year supply agreements with these customers. Price, service, product quality and security of supply are the major competitive market factors.
Sales of our consumer and industrial products accounted for 39% of our 2020 Salt segment sales. We are the third largest producer of consumer and industrial salt products in North America. These products include commercial and consumer applications, such as water conditioning, consumer and professional ice control, food processing, agricultural applications, table salt and a variety of industrial applications. We believe we are among the largest private-label producers of water conditioning salt in North America and of table salt in Canada. Our Sifto brand encompasses a full line of salt products, which are well recognized in Canada.
Our consumer and industrial business has broad product lines with both private-label and Company brands. Our consumer and industrial product line is distributed through many channels including retail, agricultural, industrial, janitorial and sanitation, and resellers. These consumer and industrial products are channeled from our plants and third-party warehouses to our customers using a combination of direct sales personnel, contract personnel and a network of brokers or manufacturers’ representatives.
The chart below shows our annual sales volumes of Salt products:

Competition
We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. In North America, other large, nationally and internationally recognized companies compete with our Salt products. In addition, there are also several smaller regional producers of salt. There are several importers of salt into North America, which mostly impact the East Coast and West Coast of the U.S. where we have minimal market presence. Two competitors serve the highway deicing salt market in the U.K., one in Northern England and one in Northern Ireland. Typically, there are not significant imports of highway deicing salt into the U.K. 
Salt is a commodity, which limits the potential for product differentiation and increases competition. Additionally, low barriers to entry in the consumer and industrial markets increase competition. Our advantageous geographical locations, superior assets and distribution network strengthen our competitive position. 
PLANT NUTRITION 
Overview
Fertilizers are critical for efficient crop production using the limited arable land resources available around the world. The nutrients needed to ensure plant health can be divided into three categories: 
•macro nutrients - the traditional NPK fertilizers (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)), 
•secondary nutrients - calcium, magnesium and sulfur, and 
•specialty plant nutrients - trace elements of iron, manganese, copper, boron, zinc, molybdenum, chlorine and nickel.

9 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

In addition, a wide range of nutritional and functional enhancers, biostimulants and adjuvants are critical for a plant’s metabolic processes and overall stress and disease resistance. The application and necessity of essential nutritional supplements is based on Liebig’s Law of the Minimum, which is the principle that only by increasing the amount of the scarcest nutrient can the growth of a plant or crop be enhanced, despite the plentiful presence of other nutrients. In parallel, the increased adoption of technologically advanced seeds (both conventional and genetically modified) has driven farmers around the globe to address the higher nutritional demands of crops and to apply essential nutritional supplements to unlock the yield potential embedded in these seeds.
Our plant nutrition businesses focus on higher-value plant nutrients including SOP, specialty formulations of macro fertilizers and a wide range of high-value specialty products incorporating secondary nutrients, specialty plant nutrients and nutritional and functional enhancers. Our products contribute to improved overall plant-metabolism, nutrient uptake and fixing, stress resistance, plant defense mechanisms, energy conversion, cell division, root enhancement and leaf, flower and fruit formation, among other benefits. The yield-enhancing properties of these supplements have been shown to provide significant farm productivity gains. Our plant nutrition strategy is based upon maximizing the profitability of our current product portfolio, innovating new technology-driven products and robust commercialization of these technologies globally. 
Factors influencing the plant nutrition market include world grain and food supply, currency fluctuations, weather and climate change, grower incomes, changes in consumer diets, general levels of economic activity, government food programs, governmental agriculture and energy policies in the U.S. and around the world, and the amount or type of crop grown in certain locations, or the type or amount of fertilizer product used. In addition, our plant nutrition results can be impacted by seasonality (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality” for more information).
In 2020, our plant nutrition businesses, on a combined basis, accounted for 43% of our sales (see Part II, Item 8, Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial information). The chart below shows our 2020 plant nutrition businesses sales by geography:
PLANT NUTRITION NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT
Industry Overview
Our Plant Nutrition North America segment includes sales of SOP and specialty plant nutrients. There are two major forms of potassium-based fertilizer, SOP, a specialty form of potassium which also provides plant-ready sulfur, and muriate of potash (“MOP” or “KCl”). Based on management’s estimates, the average annual worldwide consumption of all potash fertilizers is approximately 88 million tons, with MOP accounting for over 85% of all potash used in fertilizer production. SOP represents approximately 8% of all potash production. The remainder of potash is supplied in forms containing varying concentrations of potassium (expressed as potassium oxide) along with different combinations of co-nutrients. SOP, which contains the equivalent of approximately 50% potassium oxide, maintains a price premium over MOP due to the fact that it contains the secondary nutrient, sulfur, does not contain chlorides and is more expensive to produce than MOP. Additionally, many high-value or chloride-sensitive crops experience improved yields and quality when SOP is applied instead of MOP. SOP is also a more cost-effective alternative to other forms of specialty potash. 
Our North American SOP sales are concentrated in the Western and Southeastern U.S. where the crops and soil conditions favor the use of low-chloride potassium nutrients. Consequently, weather patterns and field conditions in these locations can impact Plant Nutrition North America sales volumes. 

10 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

While long-term global consumption of potash has increased in response to growing populations and the need for additional food supplies, the market for commodity potash has been challenged over the last few years due to a downturn in the broader crop market which has pressured grower incomes. However, recently improved economics for row crops has led to an improved commodity potash market. We expect the long-term demand for all potassium nutrients to continue to grow as arable land per capita decreases, thereby encouraging improved crop yields. Additionally demand for our SOP products has been resilient despite the challenges facing the global potash market.
We expect our future growth to stem from continuing to build the North American specialty fertilizer market demand through the innovation and commercialization of our products and the conversion of certain commodity potassium applications into higher yield SOP applications. 
Approximately 91% of our Plant Nutrition North America sales in 2020 were made to U.S. customers, who include retail fertilizer dealers and distributors of agricultural products as well as professional turf care customers. In some cases, these dealers and distributors combine or blend our Plant Nutrition North America products with other fertilizers and minerals to produce fertilizer blends tailored to individual requirements. 
Operations and Facilities
We produce SOP at two facilities, both located in North America, namely at our Ogden facility on the Great Salt Lake, and our Wynyard, Saskatchewan, Canada facility on Big Quill Lake. Our Ogden facility is the largest SOP production site in the western hemisphere and one of only four large-scale solar brine evaporation operations for SOP in the world. The facility operates approximately 55,000 acres of solar evaporation ponds to produce SOP and salt, including magnesium chloride, from the Great Salt Lake’s naturally occurring brine. The facility is located on land that is both owned and leased under renewable leases from the State of Utah. We believe that our property and operating equipment are maintained in good working condition. This facility has the capability to produce up to 320,000 tons of solar pond-based SOP, approximately 750,000 tons of magnesium chloride and 1.5 million tons of salt annually when weather conditions are typical.
These recoverable minerals exist in vast quantities in the Great Salt Lake. We believe the recoverable minerals exceed 100 years of reserves at current production rates and capacities and the lake quantities are so vast that they will not be significantly impacted by our production. While our rights to extract these minerals are contractually limited, we believe we will be able to extend our lease agreements, as we have in the past, at commercially reasonable terms, without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions.
Initially, we draw mineral-rich lake water, or brine, from the Great Salt Lake into our solar evaporation ponds. The brine moves through a series of solar evaporation ponds over a two- to three-year production cycle. As the water evaporates and the mineral concentration increases, some of those minerals naturally precipitate out of the brine and are deposited on the pond floors. These deposits provide the minerals necessary for processing into SOP, salt and magnesium chloride. The evaporation process is dependent upon sufficient lake brine levels and hot, arid summer weather conditions. The potassium-bearing salts are mechanically harvested out of the solar evaporation ponds and refined to high-purity SOP in our production facility.
We also have a unique ability to use KCl and other potassium-rich minerals as a raw material feedstock to supplement our solar harvest to help meet demand when it is economically feasible. 
We have invested to increase the efficiency and expand the capacity of our Ogden facility through upgrades to our processing plant and our solar evaporation ponds. These investments have included modifications to our existing solar evaporation ponds to increase the annual solar harvest and the extraction yield from the harvest and processing capacity of our SOP plant. In 2017, we completed a project to further expand our SOP production capacity by augmenting our ability to convert KCl into SOP. As a result, our annual SOP production capacity at our Ogden facility can be scaled up to approximately 550,000 tons, including amounts produced with both solar-pond based feedstock and supplemental KCl feedstock.
We also own our Wynyard, Saskatchewan facility, which contributes 40,000 tons to our annual SOP capacity and is Canada’s only SOP production facility. At this facility, we combine sulfate-rich brine with sourced potassium chloride to create SOP through ion exchange and glaserite processes. This product is high purity and is used in crop nutrient applications as well as specialty, non-agricultural applications.
We hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and approvals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities.
Products and Sales
We currently generate most of our sales and earnings in our Plant Nutrition North America segment through the production and sale of SOP. Our SOP is sold in various grades under our Protassium+ brand. Our Protassium+ product line consists of different grades sized for use in broadcast spreaders, direct application and liquid fertilizer solutions. Our turf product line consists of grades sized for use by the turf and ornamental markets and for blends used on golf course greens. We also provide an organic product line with grades sized for a wide range of applications. 
We also develop and distribute specialty plant nutrients under our Wolf Trax and other brands. These innovative products are based upon proprietary technologies and are focused on improving application efficiency and yield potential through various means, including by increasing root interception points in order to provide accessible plant nutrition at key 

11 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

developmental stages as well as via fertigation, seasonal foliar applications and seed nutrition. Our Wolf Trax and other specialty plant nutrition products contain nutrients that are essential to a wide range of crops, including commodity row crops, with different plants and soil conditions requiring different specialty plant nutrients.
Our Protassium+ and specialty plant nutrition product lines are generally sold to crop input distributors and dealers who then sell our product to farmers and growers. Our commercial efforts focus on educating and selling the agronomic benefits of SOP as a source of potassium nutrients and various specialty plant nutrients to plant health.
Competition
SOP is marketed globally with approximately 60% of the world’s 10 million tons of estimated capacity located in China. Management estimates global SOP capacity to be as follows: 
We are the leading SOP producer and marketer in North America and we also market SOP products internationally, depending on market conditions. Our major competition for SOP sales in North America includes imports from the EU. Fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar coupled with Baltic freight rates impact the level of international competition we face. As the only SOP producer with production facilities in North America, and as a result of our logistically favorable production site near Ogden, Utah, we estimate that our share of the North American market is sizable. In addition to imported SOP, there is functional competition between SOP and other forms of potassium crop nutrients, such as MOP. The specialty plant nutrient market is highly fragmented. Commodity and specialty crops require specialty plant nutrients in varying degrees depending on the crop and soil conditions. While sales of Wolf Trax products have historically been concentrated in North America, we also sell our specialty plant nutrient products globally, primarily in the EU, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.
PLANT NUTRITION SOUTH AMERICA SEGMENT 
Industry Overview
Our Plant Nutrition South America segment manufactures, distributes and markets a wide array of specialty plant nutrients and supplements developed and formulated from essential primary and secondary nutrients, specialty plant nutrients and biostimulants. These products consist of different chemical molecules, chemical compositions and production processes than conventional NPK fertilizers. This specific category of plant nutrients offers a diversity of delivery mechanisms, low environmental impact, low dosages per acre, and reflects a high degree of innovation and product development. These products also require more marketing than conventional NPK fertilizers, among other differences. Brazilian soils are naturally deficient in nutrients such as zinc, manganese and boron, among others. We estimate that Brazilian farmers, on average, only use approximately 25% of the optimal prescription of essential nutritional supplements. During 2020, 79% of sales generated by Plant Nutrition South America were derived from the manufacturing and marketing of these agricultural products. We believe we are one of the market leaders in Brazil and offer a more comprehensive range of products and brands compared to our competitors. 
In addition to agriculture products, this segment produces water and wastewater treatment chemicals in Brazil for cleaning, decontaminating and purifying water as well as process chemicals for industrial use. This business benefits from the rapidly expanding focus on, and increased investment in, improving standards for drinking water purification and wastewater treatment. Our water treatment customers include state and municipal entities, wastewater treatment companies and manufacturing 

12 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

companies that treat their own wastewater. Our chemical solutions business also benefits from growth in Brazilian industrial sectors that use our products, including the oil and gas exploration, mining, pulp and paper production and ethanol production industries. Our involvement in both businesses allows us to benefit from greater purchasing power with suppliers given that a significant portion of the mineral inputs for both businesses are identical. In 2020, 21% of sales generated by Plant Nutrition South America were derived from our chemical solutions business.
Our strategy for Plant Nutrition South America is to leverage our innovative product portfolio and direct-to-farmer sales platform. We expect to continue to drive market growth by increasing the adoption rate and acre penetration of nutritional supplements. Our plan is to reinforce the use of these supplements as a profitable tool to enhance crop productivity. We use a three-pronged approach to deliver under our strategy, consisting of (1) our specialized agronomic research teams, (2) our technical in-the-field agronomic sales force, and (3) continuous innovation.
We expect to increase sales through new product introductions and growth in direct-to-farmer distribution channels. We continually invest in the development of new products and new generations of existing products that meet the specific needs of our customers. As a result of these efforts, our direct-to-end-customer sales to large farmers have increased as a proportion of total agriculture productivity revenues.
Operations and Facilities
We operate nine production facilities throughout Brazil, including a property we jointly operate with a third-party. Our production facilities are located in the Southeast and Northeast parts of Brazil. Our Plant Nutrition South America production facility network has a significant level of integration. While some production facilities are focused on producing chemical and physical transformation of ingredients, such as our Jacareí I production facility with sulfur derivatives, others are specialized in transforming these ingredients into final products for our customers by mixing them with other ingredients produced in different or the same production facilities. We also use by-products from one production facility as a raw material for another production facility where possible.
The table below shows our Plant Nutrition South America production facilities by product line:

 | Production Facility

Chemical Solutions | X | | X | | | X | X | | 

(a)We hold a 50% ownership interest through a joint venture with Fermavi Eletroquímica Ltda.
Our products are produced through a series of chemical and physical transformations in automated reactors, granulators, grinders and mixers. Our equipment is capable of processing both primary and secondary sources of raw materials, thus enabling us to rapidly remodel our production process to deal with variations in element concentration in raw material feeds. This also allows us flexibility with regard to raw material purchasing opportunities, allowing us to purchase products that are less expensive on a percentage-contained-metal-basis.
Products and Sales 
As of December 31, 2020, our total Plant Nutrition South America portfolio consisted of approximately 875 products, including approximately 650 in agriculture productivity and 225 in chemical solutions. The agriculture productivity products may be applied for different stages of a plant’s life cycle, different soil and other growing conditions, different crop types and using different delivery mechanisms. We also provide value-added services to our customers such as soil analysis programs, technical trainings and conferences, crop field test and research, sales support and specialized technical support, which allow us to tailor our Plant Nutrition South America products and sales to a wide variety of customers, diverse types of crops and multiple regions. Through our chemical solutions business, we manufacture, market and supply water treatment products and chemicals for industrial processes. Our water treatment products have many different uses including algae control, alkalinity control, disinfection control, odor and corrosion control, water filtration and water clarification. 
Competition
Agricultural Productivity - The Brazilian market for nutritional supplements is highly fragmented with hundreds of market participants. Competitors typically focus their product offerings on specific product categories and delivery mechanisms, geographic regions and selected crops. As a result, we have different competitors for different market situations. The international competitive landscape is also fragmented. We estimate there are approximately 19 international competitors present in Brazil, mainly from the EU. 
Market consolidation is likely to continue in the future, as players are challenged to keep up with demands for product innovation, increasingly specialized agronomic and technical skills, the effect of specific legislation, licensing and product registration procedures, cost pressures from economies of scale and other industry trends. Many competitors have limited production capabilities and can better be characterized as resellers, mixers and marketing companies, rather than producers. We

COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

differentiate ourselves by innovation, a broad market presence using a large technical sales force, an extensive network of point-of-sales distributors, resellers and cooperatives and direct sales to large farmers and industrial customers. This presence enhances our new product placement capabilities, thereby driving market growth. 
Chemical Solutions - We believe we are one of the largest manufacturers of water treatment chemicals in Brazil. We have a strong presence in the Northeast and Southeast regions of Brazil, which allows us to take advantage of efficient logistics due to proximity to raw materials and customers. We estimate that there are approximately five companies that account for approximately two-thirds of the Brazilian water treatment market. However, as the water treatment market is highly regional by nature, average market shares do not reflect the actual competitive strength for each company by geography, product and customer type. Our strategy is to focus on the regions in which our production facilities are located and where our product’s attributes give us a naturally strong market positions.
In the case of public customers, suppliers of water treatment chemicals compete through a pre-qualification and public bidding process. Barriers to market entry are therefore related to low cost of production (strongly influenced by access to low raw material costs, reduced logistics and large production scale), consistency of product quality and specification, existing customer relationships and previous supply experience. 
We believe we are among the seven primary producers of caustic soda, chlorine and bleach in Brazil. Our market position is substantially stronger in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil where we operate. 
OTHER
DeepStore is our records management business in the U.K. that utilizes portions of previously excavated space in our salt mine in Winsford, Cheshire, for secure underground document storage and one warehouse location in London, England. Currently, DeepStore does not have a significant share of the document storage market in the U.K., and it is not material in comparison to our Salt, Plant Nutrition North America and Plant Nutrition South America segments.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, license arrangements and domain name registrations. These protections are important to our business and we believe that our success is at least partly dependent on the acquisition and maintenance of these rights. However, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, operational knowledge and marketing abilities required by our business in order to succeed. 
We sell many of our products under a number of registered trademarks that we believe are widely recognized in the industry. Our trademarks registered pursuant to applicable intellectual property laws include COMPASS MINERALS, PROTASSIUM+, WOLF TRAX (and design), NU-TRAX, PROAQUA, KELLUS, ROCKET SEEDS, PROFOL, AMERICAN STOCKMAN, FREEZGARD, SAFE STEP, SIFTO and SURE PAWS. 
Any issued patents, trademarks or copyrights on our proprietary technology may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial to us. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability. Competitors may challenge our patent rights. If our patents are held unenforceable, our competitors could commercialize our patented technology.
With respect to proprietary know-how, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we may not be able to prevent unauthorized use of our technology. The disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position (see “Risk Factors—Our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement.” for more information).
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 3,229 employees, of which 1,224 were located in Brazil, 1,051 were located in the U.S., 780 were located in Canada and 174 were located in the U.K. Approximately 50% of our workforce in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and approximately 30% of our global workforce were represented by collective bargaining agreements. Of our 12 collective bargaining agreements in effect on January 1, 2021, two will expire in 2021 (including one for the Goderich mine, which expires on March 31, 2021), five will expire in 2022, three will expire in 2023 and one will expire in 2027. In addition, trade union membership is mandatory in Brazil, where approximately 40% of our global workforce is located as of December 31, 2020.

Environmental, Health and Safety
At Compass Minerals, we place no priority higher than the health and safety of our employees, and the commitments we have made to our stockholders, customers and communities to create a sustainable company for generations to come. We work to ensure safety throughout our operations and in the communities where we are located. We focus on ongoing education with respect to environmental, health and safety matters, and injury prevention and reduction across all our operations.
Our Company has a comprehensive approach to workplace health and safety that fosters a strong safety culture. We have identified “Top Risks” that are consistently discussed to help keep them top-of-mind. One of our strategic imperatives is “Zero Harm,” which includes measuring our total case incident rate (“TCIR”). In 2020, we reduced our TCIR by 16% compared to the prior year.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As part of our focus on Zero Harm, we created a cross-functional Crisis Management Team to monitor developments related to the spread of COVID-19, take appropriate steps to protect our workforce and review business continuity protocols that were already in place. 
As an essential business, we have continued producing and delivering products that support critical industries such as transportation, agriculture, chemical, food, pharmaceutical and animal nutrition. Our management team has taken multiple actions to limit the exposure of employees to the spread of COVID-19, including instituting remote working where possible, adjusting shift schedules and crew sizes to enable social distancing, restricting visitation to operational sites, curtailing all business-related commercial air travel, and increasing sanitation of offices and common areas within our facilities. See Item 1A Risk Factors - “The COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreaks of infectious disease or similar public health threats, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” and Part II, Item 7 for more information.
Organizational Health
We launched an enterprise-wide campaign in 2020 to improve organizational health, understanding its impact on long-term performance and sustainability of the organization. We identified nine priority health practices to help provide focus and set a compelling, clear direction for employees, encourage the generation of ideas from within and across the enterprise, and execute in a disciplined way with strengthened accountability. To underline this commitment, we launched an employee network of Health Champions, a resource for sharing information about our business and health practices among peers.
We integrate organizational health practices into our professional development efforts to better equip employees with skills to work, lead and coach others in their day-to-day responsibilities.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, 90% of our employees participated in an annual organizational health index (“OHI”) survey in which 55% of employees reported they believe our Company health improved within the prior six months and our overall OHI score more than doubled compared to a 2019 OHI survey.
Diversity & Inclusion
We value the critical role our employees play in our success. They are in fact our most important resource. We believe it is paramount that we build a diverse and inclusive organization where our employees are safe, where they feel valued and heard, where they can thrive and grow professionally, and where they can take pride in their work and our Company.
In 2020, we created a new role, Vice President of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, to lead our efforts toward ensuring policies and practices foster an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment for all employees. Additionally, we launched a focus group of U.S. employees representing various ages, genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations and backgrounds to provide guidance on our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Because one approach does not effectively work across multiple countries when it comes to diversity, our diversity and inclusion efforts may adjust as they are implemented in other countries in which we operate. To help demonstrate our commitment to the fair treatment of all, President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Kevin S. Crutchfield joined other CEOs around the world in signing the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge. 
Also in 2020, we introduced a Parental Leave policy that provides all regular full-time U.S. employees, regardless of gender and including adoptive parents, with the opportunity to take up to six weeks of paid leave to bond with a new child at 100% of base pay rate. We also joined a program offered through the Brazil government that increases paternal leave to 20 days and maternal leave to six months for our Brazil employees. 
We also have LINK (Leading, Inspiring, Networking and Knowing) employee resource groups that help our people grow and succeed through mentoring and professional development. These LINK groups demonstrate how inclusion is able to enhance employee engagement, create opportunities and drive business results.

Employee Development 
Our employees have access to a robust learning management system as a resource to support personal and professional growth. The platforms offer a one-stop online site for employee training and development. Programs range from managing priorities to assistance for new supervisors. Also included is the Compass Leadership Essential (“CLE”) series, which launched in 2020. Compass Leadership Essentials is required learning for our people managers and aims to further develop business capabilities in order to build stronger leaders. In 2020, CLE launched at our North American sites and we plan to introduce CLE to our U.K. and Brazil sites in the future. 
In 2020, we implemented an expanded talent review program, which included increasing the use of individual development plans, consistent reviews and succession planning. As of December 31, 2020, 100% of our critical positions have a succession plan in place, along with individual development plans to help ensure business continuity. 
Additionally, employees have opportunities for professional development through strategic partnerships with outside organizations, such as The Fertilizer Institute; U.K. Salt Association; Industrial Minerals Association – North America; Central Exchange; Ontario Mining Association; American Chamber of Commerce for Brazil; Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining; American Royal; Brazilian Human Resources Association; and Women in Agribusiness, to name a few.
Community
Beyond the success of our company and our people, we are committed to supporting and creating value for our communities. We recognize that in many areas, we play an integral role in providing jobs and fostering local economic growth. On a larger scale, through our products, we support safety, sustainability and addressing food insecurity in communities around the world.
Compass Minerals Cares, our philanthropic program, helps our Company and our employees positively impact the communities where we live and work, and creates a great sense of pride in our employees. This program focuses on our core pillars of community engagement, including company gifts and volunteerism.

With respect to each facility at which we produce salt, brine or SOP, permits, licenses and approvals are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on our mine plans and federal, state, provincial and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing. Based on our historical permitting experience, we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits and approvals to support historical rates of production.
Our mineral leases have varying terms. Some will expire after a set term of years, while others continue indefinitely. Many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific amount per ton of minerals extracted or as a percentage of revenue. In addition, we own a number of properties and are party to non-mining leases that permit us to perform activities that are ancillary to our mining operations, such as surface use leases for storage at depots and warehouse leases. We believe that all of our leases were entered into at market terms.

COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations subject us to an evolving set of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations. These EHS laws and regulations regulate, or propose to regulate, the conduct of our mining and production operations, including safety procedures and process safety management; management and handling of raw and in-process materials and finished products; air and water quality impacts from our facilities; management of hazardous and solid wastes; remediation of contamination at our facilities; and post-mining land reclamation. 
The Environment, Health, Safety and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors works closely with our management to provide oversight of EHS and sustainability matters impacting us to promote a culture that prioritizes safety, environmental stewardship and sustainability. The committee monitors our EHS and sustainability performance against our targets and objectives. We have a comprehensive EHS management program that strives to consistently achieve predictable performance. Our EHS program includes identifying and managing EHS risks; regulatory compliance; effective policies and procedures; behavior based safety; training and education; facility evaluations; and site leadership accountability for EHS performance and sustainable growth with support from EHS professionals. Site leadership is responsible for day-to-day oversight of EHS performance at their specific location. 
While a number of our capital projects indirectly result in environmental improvements, we estimate that our 2020 environmental-specific capital expenditures were $2.2 million. We expect to have approximately the same level of environmental capital expenditures in 2021. However, future capital expenditures are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes to environmental laws and regulations, changes to our operations or unforeseen remediation requirements, and these expenditures could exceed our expectations. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded $2.0 million of accruals for contingent environmental liabilities. We accrue for contingent environmental liabilities when we believe it is probable that we will be responsible, in whole or in part, for environmental investigation or remediation activities and the expenditures for these activities are reasonably estimable. However, the extent and costs of any environmental investigation or remediation activities are uncertain and difficult to estimate and could exceed our expectations, which could materially affect our financial condition and operating results.
Operating Requirements and Impacts
Our operations require permits for extraction of salt and brine, air emissions, surface water discharges of process material and wastes, waste generation, injection of brine and wastewater in to subsurface wells and other activities. As a result, we hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and approvals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities. These permits, licenses and approvals are typically subject to renewals and reissuances. Expansion of our operations or production capacity, or preservation of existing rights in some cases, is also predicated upon securing any necessary permits, licenses and approvals. The terms and conditions of future EHS laws and regulations, permits, licenses and approvals may be more stringent and may require increased expenditures on our part. In addition, although we do not engage in hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as “fracking”), laws and regulations targeting fracking could lead to increased permit requirements and compliance costs for non-fracking operations, including our Salt operations, which require permitted wastewater disposal wells that sometimes receive fluid waste from fracking operations as well.
Our Cote Blanche mine, an underground salt mine located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, is subject to regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the “Mine Act”). MSHA is required to regularly inspect the Cote Blanche mine and issue a citation, or take other enforcement action, if an inspector or authorized representative believes that a violation of the Mine Act or MSHA’s standards or regulations has occurred. As required by MSHA, these operations are regularly inspected by MSHA personnel. See “Mine Safety Disclosures” and Exhibit 95 to this report for information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by SEC rules. The cost of compliance and penalties for violations of the Mine Act have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Our underground salt mines located in Goderich, Canada and Winsford, UK are subject to similar regulations regarding health and safety, and the cost of compliance with these regulations also have been and are expected to be significant.
We have post-closure reclamation obligations, primarily arising under our mining permits or by agreement. Many of these obligations include requirements to maintain financial surety bonds to fund reclamation and site cleanup following the ultimate closure of our mines or certain other facilities. As a result, we maintain financial surety bonds to satisfy these obligations. 
We are also impacted by the U.S. Clean Air Act (the “Clean Air Act”) and other EHS laws and regulations that regulate air emissions. These regulatory programs may require us to make capital expenditures (for example, by installing expensive emissions abatement equipment), modify our operational practices, obtain additional permits or make other expenditures, which could be significant. Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency reclassified the Great Salt Lake area as a “serious” non-attainment area in May 2017 due to the presence of certain air pollutants. Because our Ogden facility is located in this area, this re-classification could lead to new regulations that could require us to make significant expenditures or 

20 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

require us to modify our operational practices. In addition, we could incur fines or penalties for violations of the Clean Air Act or other EHS laws and regulations that regulate air emissions.
In August 2017, the Brazilian government ratified the United Nations Minamata Convention on Mercury, which commits signatories to compel chlor-alkali facilities to phase out the use of mercury cell facilities by 2025, to ensure that mercury from these facilities is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner and to subject these facilities to record keeping and reporting requirements. If the Brazil government adopts regulations limiting the use of mercury pursuant to the convention’s requirements or otherwise, our Igarassu, Brazil facility which operates a mercury cell facility could be impacted. We cannot predict the timing, extent or content of the final regulations related to the United Nations Minamata Convention on Mercury, or their ultimate cost to, or impact on us. To support transitioning away from mercury use at our Igarassu facility, we have invested in, and plan to continue to invest in, non-mercury technology as well as waste water and storm water treatment improvement projects.
We endeavor to conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable EHS laws, regulations, permits or approvals. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations occur from time to time in our industry, and from time to time we have received notices from governmental agencies that we are not in compliance with certain EHS laws, regulations, permits or approvals. Upon receipt of these notices, we evaluate the matter and take all appropriate corrective actions.
Remedial Activities
Many of our past and present facilities have been in operation for decades. Operations at these facilities have historically involved the use and handling of regulated chemical substances, salt, salt byproducts and process tailings by us and our predecessors.
At many of these facilities, releases and disposal of regulated substances have occurred and could occur in the future, which could require us to investigate, undertake or pay for remediation activities under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other similar EHS laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impose “no fault” liability on past and present owners and operators of facilities associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances, regardless of fault or the legality of the original actions. Additionally, one past or present owner or operator may be required to bear more than its proportional share of liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. 
In addition, third parties have alleged in the past and could allege in the future that our operations have resulted in contamination to neighboring off-site areas or third-party facilities, including third-party disposal facilities for regulated substances generated by our operations, which could result in liability for us under CERCLA or other EHS laws and regulations. 
We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs and liabilities as a result of our current and former operations and our predecessor’s operations. In the past, we have agreed to undertake or pay for investigations to determine whether remediation will be required under CERCLA or otherwise to address any contamination. In other instances, we have agreed to perform remediation activities or have undertaken voluntary remediation to address identified contamination. Ongoing investigation and remediation activities at our property in Kenosha, Wisconsin are described in Part II, Item 8, Note 12 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Other Regulatory Matters
As a global company, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations. The most significant government regulations that impact our business, in addition to EHS laws and regulations, operating requirements and remedial activities, are discussed below. For further discussion of how government regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Taxes and Tariffs - We are subject to complex requirements of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to taxation, tariffs and import duties. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on taxes.
Import and Export Requirements, Anti-Corruption Laws and Related Matters - We manufacture, market and sell our products both inside and outside the U.S. and ship our products across international borders. As a result, we are required to comply with a number of U.S. and international regulations, which include fair competition (antitrust) laws, import and export requirements, customs laws and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the Brazilian Clean Companies Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage. 
Employment and Labor Relations - We are also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing our relationships with our employees, including those relating to wages, overtime, labor matters, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination, immigration, work permits and employee benefits. 

21 | 2020 FORM 10-K/A


COMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Impacts of Regulatory Matters
Costs of compliance with laws and regulations, including management effort, time and resources, have been and are expected to continue to be significant. These costs include the capital projects related to environmental improvements discussed above. New or proposed regulatory programs (including EHS regulatory programs), as well as future interpretations and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may impact our business significantly, our ability to serve customers, preclude us from conducting business with governmental entities, require modification to our facilities, lead to substantial increases in operating costs, penalties, injunctions, civil remedies or fines or cause interruptions, modifications or a termination of operations, the extent to which we cannot predict. Anticipating future compliance obligations, implementing compliance plans and estimating future costs can be particularly challenging while laws and regulations are under development and have not been adopted.
