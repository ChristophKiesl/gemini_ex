Item 1. Business.
General Development of Business
Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (“TripCo” or the “Company”) was formed in 2013 as a Delaware corporation. TripCo was a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (subsequently renamed Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate Retail”)) until the completion of its spin-off from Qurate Retail on August 27, 2014 (“TripCo Spin-Off”). Following the TripCo Spin-Off, Qurate Retail and TripCo operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. TripCo does not have any operations outside of its controlling interest in its subsidiary, Tripadvisor, Inc. (“Tripadvisor”). As of December 31, 2020, TripCo held an approximate 23% economic interest and 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor.
In connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, TripCo entered into certain agreements, including the services agreement, the facilities sharing agreement and the tax sharing agreement, with Qurate Retail and/or Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) (or certain of their subsidiaries) in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the companies after the TripCo Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition.
Pursuant to the services agreement (except as described below in respect to Gregory B. Maffei), Liberty Media provides TripCo with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. TripCo reimburses Liberty Media for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty Media in providing these services and TripCo pays a services fee to Liberty Media under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment semi-annually, as necessary. 
In December 2019, TripCo entered into an amendment to the services agreement with Liberty Media in connection with Liberty Media’s entry into a new employment arrangement with Gregory B. Maffei, TripCo’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the amended services agreement, components of his compensation would either be paid directly to him by each of TripCo, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“LBC”), GCI Liberty, Inc. and Qurate Retail (collectively, the “Service Companies”) or reimbursed to Liberty Media, in each case, based on allocations among Liberty Media and the Service Companies set forth in the amended services agreement, currently set at 5% for the Company but subject to adjustment on an annual basis upon the occurrence of certain events. The amended services agreement between Liberty Media and Mr. Maffei provides for a five year employment term which began on January 1, 2020 and ends December 31, 2024, with an aggregate annual base salary of $3 million (with no contracted increase), an aggregate one-time cash commitment bonus of $5 million (paid in December 2019), an aggregate annual target cash performance bonus of $17 million, aggregate annual equity awards of $17.5 million and aggregate equity awards granted in connection with his entry into his new agreement of $90 million (the “upfront awards”). A portion of the grants made to our CEO in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to our Company’s allocable portion of these upfront awards.
Under the facilities sharing agreement, TripCo shares office space with Liberty Media and related amenities at Liberty Media’s corporate headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. 
On March 15, 2020, TripCo and Gregory B. Maffei entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Certares Holdings LLC, Certares Holdings (Blockable) LLC and Certares Holdings (Optional) LLC with respect to an investment in TripCo’s Series A Preferred Stock, which was later assigned to Certares LTRIP LLC (“Certares” or the “Purchaser”). Pursuant to the assigned Investment Agreement, on March 26, 2020, TripCo issued 325,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Certares for a purchase price of $1,000 per share.

 Description of Business
Tripadvisor
Tripadvisor is a leading online travel company and its mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. Tripadvisor operates a global travel guidance platform that connects the world’s largest audience of prospective travelers with travel partners through rich content, price comparison tools and online reservation and related services for destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants.
Under its flagship brand, Tripadvisor, it launched www.Tripadvisor.com in the United States in 2000. Since then, Tripadvisor has launched localized versions of the Tripadvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. 
Tripadvisor’s Industry and Market Opportunity
Tripadvisor operates in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel and travel-related activity, and the online advertising market.

I-3



In January 2021, Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, estimated that the annual global travel market (not including dining) will reach $1.4 trillion of bookings in 2022 and is increasingly shifting online. As consumer travel media consumption and travel commerce activity increasingly moves online, Tripadvisor believes travel and travel-related businesses will continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels in order to grow their businesses. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative impact on the travel, hospitality, restaurant, and leisure industry and consequently adversely and materially affected Tripadvisor’s business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition during the year ended December 31, 2020. With uncertainty over travel continuing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no one knows how quickly global travel will recover and what the travel experience will look like once new health screening measures are in place. However, Tripadvisor believes that, while the pandemic could permanently change travel in certain ways, global travel will return to the pre-pandemic levels. Consumers want to connect with others, learn about new places and see things they have not seen before. Tripadvisor believes this passion for travel combined with the need to make informed choices creates significant long-term growth opportunities for its business.
Business Model
On a global scale, Tripadvisor matches consumer demand for travel with its travel partners that offer accommodations and travel experiences. 
Consumer Offerings
Tripadvisor helps consumers plan, book, and enjoy the trips that matter. Its platform, which offers content, supply, price, and convenience, has led Tripadvisor to become a global brand, attracting hundreds of millions of unique visitors that visit its sites each month, and influences a significant amount of travel commerce. Tripadvisor is focused on creating the best online experience in travel planning and booking, making it easier for consumers to research destinations and experiences, read and contribute user-generated content, compare destinations and businesses based on quality, price and availability, and complete bookings powered by its travel partners. 
Travel Partners
Tripadvisor’s portfolio of travel-related websites enables its travel partners to be discovered, to advertise and to sell their services to a global travel audience. Travel partners may include hotel chains, independent hoteliers, online travel agencies (“OTAs”), destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers – that seek to market and sell their products and services to a global audience. Tripadvisor enables media advertising opportunities – and in some cases, facilitates transactions between consumers and travel partners in a number of ways, including by sending referrals to its travel partners’ websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of its travel partners, or by serving as the merchant of record – particularly in its Experiences offering – and by offering advertising placements on Tripadvisor websites and mobile applications (“app”).
Businesses and Products
Tripadvisor manages its business based on the following reportable segments: (1) Hotels, Media & Platform and (2) Experiences & Dining. 
The Hotels, Media & Platform segment includes revenue generated from the following sources:


● | Tripadvisor-branded Hotels Revenue. Tripadvisor’s largest source of Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on Tripadvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to its travel partners’ websites. Tripadvisor’s click-based travel partners are predominantly OTAs and hotels. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC basis. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process, also known as hotel auction revenue, where travel partner CPC bids for rates and availability to be listed on Tripadvisor’s site are submitted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I-4



Tripadvisor also offers subscription-based advertising to hotels, owners of B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties, enabling subscribers to advertise their businesses on Tripadvisor’s websites, as well as manage and promote their website URL, email address, phone number, special offers and other information related to their business. Subscription-based advertising services are predominantly sold for a flat fee for a contracted period of time. In addition, Tripadvisor generates revenue on a cost-per-action, or “CPA” basis, which consists of contextually-relevant booking links to its travel partners’ websites which are advertised on its platform. Tripadvisor earns a commission from its travel partners for each traveler who clicks to and books a hotel reservation on the travel partners’ website, which results in a traveler stay. Tripadvisor also offers travel partners the opportunity to advertise and promote their business through hotel sponsored placements on its websites, generally on a CPC rate basis.


● | Tripadvisor-branded Display and Platform Revenue. Tripadvisor offers businesses the ability to promote their brands through display-based advertising placements on its websites. Tripadvisor’s display-based advertising clients are predominantly direct suppliers of hotels, airlines and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. Tripadvisor also sells display-based advertising to OTAs and other travel-related businesses, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Experiences & Dining segment includes revenue generated from the following sources: 


● | Experiences. Tripadvisor provides information and services that allow consumers to research and book tours, activities and experiences in popular travel destinations both directly through Viator, its dedicated Experiences offering, and on its Tripadvisor branded websites and mobile apps. Tripadvisor works with local tour or travel activities/experiences operators (“the supplier”) to provide consumers the ability to book tours, activities and experiences (“the activity”) in popular destinations worldwide, for which Tripadvisor generates commissions for each booking transaction it facilitates through its online reservation system. Tripadvisor also powers travel tours, activities and experiences’ booking capabilities to consumers on affiliate partner websites, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains, and online and offline travel agencies who display and promote on Tripadvisor’s websites the supplier activities available on its platform to generate bookings for which Tripadvisor earns a commission.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dining. Tripadvisor provides information and services for consumers to research and book restaurant reservations in popular travel destinations through its dedicated online restaurant reservations offering, TheFork, and on its Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. Tripadvisor primarily generates transaction fees (or per seated diner fees) that are paid by its restaurant customers for diners seated through TheFork’s online reservation system. Tripadvisor also generates subscription fees for subscription-based advertising to restaurants, access to certain online reservation management services, marketing analytic tools and menu syndication services provided by TheFork and Tripadvisor. In addition, Tripadvisor also offers restaurant partners the opportunity to advertise and promote their business through restaurant media advertising placements on its website, generally on a CPC rate basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Included in Corporate and other are Tripadvisor’s Rentals, Flights & Car and Cruise offerings. Corporate and other includes revenue generated from the following sources: 


● | Tripadvisor’s Rentals offering provides information and services that allow travelers to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full homes, condominiums, villas, beach properties, cabins and cottages. Rentals generates revenue primarily by offering individual property owners and property managers the ability to list their rental properties on Tripadvisor’s websites and mobile apps thereby connecting with travelers primarily through a free-to-list, commission-based option or, alternatively through an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. In addition, Corporate and other also includes revenue generated from flights, cruises, and car offerings on Tripadvisor-branded websites and its portfolio of travel media brand websites, which primarily

generates click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue, similar to the Hotels, Media & Platform segment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For further information regarding segments, refer to note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Commercial Relationships 
Tripadvisor has commercial relationships with a majority of the world’s leading OTAs, as well as thousands of other travel partners pursuant to which these companies primarily purchase traveler leads from Tripadvisor, generally on a click-based advertising basis. Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, Tripadvisor seeks to ensure the mutual success of these relationships.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Tripadvisor’s two most significant travel partners were Expedia Group, Inc. (“Expedia”) and Booking Holdings Inc. (“Booking Holdings”), which each accounted for 10% or more of Tripadvisor’s consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately 25%, 33% and 37%, respectively, of its consolidated revenue, with nearly all of this revenue concentrated in the Tripadvisor-branded Hotels revenue line within the Hotels, Media & Platform segment for these reporting periods. 
Operations and Technology 
Tripadvisor has assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations and warehousing technologies. Tripadvisor makes significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies. 
Tripadvisor’s systems infrastructure for Tripadvisor-branded websites is in a "hybrid-cloud" configuration in which parts of it are housed at two geographically separate colocation facilities and managed by Tripadvisor’s operations team, while the rest is hosted on Amazon Web Services. Tripadvisor’s infrastructure installations have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each colocation facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software and content and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Tripadvisor makes use of Amazon Web Services availability zones to provide redundancy for the cloud portions of its infrastructure. Substantially all of Tripadvisor’s software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as backed up at offsite locations. Tripadvisor’s systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of Tripadvisor’s individual subsidiaries and businesses have their own data infrastructure and technology teams.
Intellectual Property
Tripadvisor’s intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of its business. Tripadvisor relies on its intellectual property rights in its content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content. Tripadvisor has acquired some of its intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties and these may place restrictions on its use of the intellectual property.
Tripadvisor protects its intellectual property by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, federal, state and common law rights. Tripadvisor protects its brands by pursuing the trademark registration of its core brands, as appropriate, maintaining its trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. Tripadvisor also registers copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, Tripadvisor 

I-6



protects its trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program.
Tripadvisor has considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by Tripadvisor.
In connection with Tripadvisor’s copyrightable content, it posts and institutes procedures under the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar “host privilege” statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs, text and other content loaded on its sites by consumers. However, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which Tripadvisor operates may affect its ability to claim immunity. 
From time to time, Tripadvisor may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including claims of alleged infringement by Tripadvisor of the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce Tripadvisor’s intellectual property rights, protect its trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm Tripadvisor’s business. 
Seasonality
Consumers’ travel expenditures have historically followed a seasonal pattern. Correspondingly, travel partners’ advertising investments and therefore Tripadvisor’s revenue and profits, have also historically followed a seasonal pattern. Tripadvisor’s financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a given year, which includes the seasonal peak in consumer demand, traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters, which represent seasonal low points. However, as discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in note 1 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, due to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor’s business, it did not experience its typical seasonal pattern for revenue and profit during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, cash outflows to travel suppliers related to deferred merchant payables significantly exceeded cash received from travelers during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting the decline in consumer demand for Tripadvisor’s products and an increase in reservation cancellations related to COVID-19. These factors contributed significantly to unfavorable working capital trends and material negative operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020, most notably occurring during the first half of 2020 when Tripadvisor typically generates significant positive cash flow. It is difficult to forecast the seasonality for fiscal year 2021, given the uncertainty related to the ultimate extent and duration of the economic and consumer impact from COVID-19, the widespread availability and distribution of the vaccine, and the shape and timing of a recovery. In addition, significant shifts in Tripadvisor’s business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.
Terms of Investment in Tripadvisor
We own an approximate 23% economic interest and 58% voting interest in Tripadvisor as of December 31, 2020. Tripadvisor’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of Tripadvisor common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect a number of directors equal to 25% of the total number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is currently three directors. We consolidate Tripadvisor as we control a majority of the voting interest in Tripadvisor. We are subject to a Governance Agreement with Tripadvisor which provides us with certain director nomination, registration and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on our shares of Class B common stock. 

I-7



Regulatory Matters 
Tripadvisor is subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and relating to the travel industry, the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services. As Tripadvisor continues to expand the reach of its brands into additional international markets and expands its product offerings, it is increasingly subject to additional laws and regulations. This includes laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, libel, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, taxation, online payment services and competition, among others. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Many of these laws and regulations are being tested in courts, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could harm Tripadvisor’s business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which Tripadvisor operates. 
In addition, Tripadvisor provides advertising data and information and conducts marketing activities that are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements and industry specific value-added tax regimes. The United States (as well as individual states), the European Union (the “E.U.”) (as well as member states) and other countries have adopted legislation that regulates that regulate certain aspects of the Internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, data privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. 
It is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation will be interpreted and applied or whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on Tripadvisor’s services, and whether or how Tripadvisor might be affected. Increased regulation of the Internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect Tripadvisor’s business, financial condition or operating results. 
Tripadvisor is subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. As Tripadvisor’s business has evolved, Tripadvisor has begun to receive and store a greater volume of personally identifiable data. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. For example, the E.U. adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, effective in May 2018, which requires companies, including Tripadvisor, to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition, the State of California adopted the Consumer Privacy Protection Act which became effective January 1, 2020 and also enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California. In addition, similar laws have been adopted or are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions. The enactment, interpretation and application of these laws is still in a state of flux. 
Also, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. passed a referendum to exit the European Union, known as Brexit, and the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. finalized the terms of the departure. While there continues to be some uncertainty around U.K. and E.U. relations, Tripadvisor does not expect Brexit will have a material impact on its business and results of operations; however, it will likely face new regulations and additional hiring costs, as well as hiring limitations from candidates outside of the U.K.
Marketing and Competition
Tripadvisor competes with other companies in rapidly evolving categories of the travel industry. In these areas, Tripadvisor competes for content, traffic, advertising dollars, and, more generally, to attract and retain consumers’ attention, both in terms of reach and engagement. Since Tripadvisor’s products and those of its competitors are typically free, Tripadvisor competes based on its brand, the quality and nature of its product offerings and its online travel search and price comparison services (or metasearch), rather than on price. As such, Tripadvisor invests heavily in constantly improving its consumer experience and expanding content, listings and bookable inventory.
Tripadvisor also invests to amplify its global brand and raise consumer awareness of, and engagement with, its end-to-end product offerings. Tripadvisor leverages a number of online and offline marketing channels, including online search engines (primarily Google), social media, email and brand advertising. The relative success of Tripadvisor’s marketing strategy is more measurable on some of these channels than others, and can be influenced by changes that 

I-8



Tripadvisor, its travel partners, or its competitors make to their respective products and marketing strategies. Tripadvisor intends to promote brand awareness and will strategically allocate resources among the different marketing channels based on the return on investment. Tripadvisor competes globally with both online and offline, established and emerging, providers of travel, lodging, experiences and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services Tripadvisor offers are intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost.
Tripadvisor also competes with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies where it operates, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:


● | Tripadvisor’s Hotels, Media & Platform segment competes, and in some cases partners, with the following businesses: OTAs (including Expedia, Booking Holdings, and their respective subsidiaries and operating companies; hotel metasearch providers (including trivago (a majority-owned subsidiary of Expedia), Kayak and HotelsCombined (subsidiaries of Booking Holdings) and Trip.com Group Limited (formerly known as Ctrip.com International, Ltd)); large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies (including Google, Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba, Airbnb and Amazon); traditional offline travel agencies; and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Within Tripadvisor’s Experiences & Dining segment, its Experiences businesses compete with online travel agencies, such as Airbnb, Booking Holdings, GetYourGuide and Klook; traditional travel agencies; online travel service providers; and wholesalers, among others. Tripadvisor’s Dining businesses compete with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Google and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Booking Holdings).

Human Capital Resources
Employees
As described above, our Company is party to a services agreement with Liberty Media, pursuant to which 84 Liberty Media corporate employees provide certain management services to the Company for a determined fee. As a result, our Company is not responsible for the hiring, retention and compensation of these individuals (except that our Company does grant equity incentive awards to these individuals). However, our Company directly benefits from the efforts undertaken by Liberty Media to attract and retain talented employees. Liberty Media strives to create a diverse, inclusive and supportive workplace, with opportunities for its employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between its employees and their communities. Our Company fully supports these efforts.

Talent Acquisition and Development 
Tripadvisor believes its employees are essential to its success and that its success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key talent. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit Tripadvisor’s operations and performance. Tripadvisor's management and Board of Directors oversee various initiatives for talent acquisition, retention and development.
Tripadvisor’s talent philosophy is to both develop talent from within and to strategically recruit key external talent. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among Tripadvisor’s employee base of its business, its products, and its customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of its continuous improvement mindset. 
Tripadvisor’s overall talent acquisition and retention strategy is designed to attract and retain diverse and qualified candidates to enable the success of the company and achievement of its performance goals. Tripadvisor recruits the best people for the job without regard to gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is its policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. Tripadvisor’s talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and encourages employee referrals for open positions.

Tripadvisor designs its benefit programs to meet the needs of its employees’ health while managing program costs for escalation rates at or below industry trend factors. Tripadvisor’s programs include but are not limited to wellness, mental health services, telemedicine, and partnerships with service providers that support diverse family-care need solutions.
