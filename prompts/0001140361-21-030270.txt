Overview
 
Our Mission
 
At Charles & Colvard, Ltd., our mission is to redefine the definition of real within the jewelry industry and for consumers everywhere. We believe fine jewelry can be accessible, beautiful, and conscientious.
About Charles & Colvard
 
Charles & Colvard, Ltd., a North Carolina corporation founded in 1995 (which may be referred to as Charles & Colvard, we, us, or our), is a globally recognized fine jewelry company specializing in lab created gemstones. We manufacture, market, and distribute Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® (which we refer to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and in September 2020, we announced our expansion into the lab grown diamond market with the launch of Caydia®, an exclusive brand of premium lab grown diamonds. We offer gemstones and finished jewelry featuring our proprietary moissanite jewels and premium lab grown diamonds for sale in the worldwide fine jewelry market. Charles & Colvard is the original source of created moissanite, and in 2015, we debuted Forever One™, our premium moissanite gemstone brand. As an e-commerce and multi-channel destination for fine jewelry featuring lab grown gemstones, we believe that the addition of lab grown diamonds is a natural progression for the Charles & Colvard brand.
 
One of our unique differentiators, moissanite – The World’s Most Brilliant Gem® – is core to our ambition to create a movement around environmentally and socially responsible fine jewelry. We believe that we are leading the way in delivering the premium moissanite brand through technological advances in gemstone manufacturing, cutting, polishing, and setting. By coupling what we believe to be unprecedented moissanite jewels with responsibly sourced precious metals, we are delivering a uniquely positioned product line for the conscientious consumer. Our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are hand selected by our Gemological Institute of America, or GIA, certified gemologists to meet Charles & Colvard’s uncompromising standards and validated by independent third-party experts. Our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are available currently in E, F, and G color grades (based on the GIA’s color grading scale) with a minimum clarity in accordance with the GIA’s VS1 clarity classification along with excellent polish and symmetry. All of our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are set with mostly recycled precious metals.
 
Our strategy is to build a globally revered brand of lab created gemstones and finished jewelry that appeal to a wide consumer audience. We believe this strategy leverages our advantages of being the original and leading worldwide source of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® and offering a curated assortment of jewelry featuring Caydia® lab grown diamonds, which together we believe offers an ideal combination of quality and value. We also believe a direct relationship with consumers is important to this strategy, which entails delivering tailored educational content, engaging in dialogue with our audience, and positioning our brand to meet the demands of today’s discerning consumer.
 
We believe our expanding application of an omni-channel sales strategy across the jewelry trade and to the end consumer with accessible lab created gemstones and value branded finished jewelry featuring Charles & Colvard moissanite and lab grown diamonds positions our goods at the many touchpoints where consumers are when they are making their buying decisions – thereby creating greater exposure for our brand and increasing consumer demand.
 
We sell loose moissanite jewels, lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry set with these gems through two operating segments: our Online Channels segment, which encompasses our digital properties components, comprised of our charlesandcolvard.com and moissaniteoutlet.com websites, e-commerce outlets, including marketplaces, drop-ship customers, and other pure-play, exclusively e-commerce customers; and our Traditional segment, which consists of domestic and international distributors and retail customers.
 
We report segment information based on the “management” approach. This segment reporting approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our operating and reportable segments. For more information about our operating segments, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Market Opportunity
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed a shift in e-commerce shopping, and we have seen this change in consumer behavior continue through June 2021. According to an Adobe Digital Economy Index Report, from Adobe Analytics, as of the quarter ended March 31, 2021, global e-commerce and online retail spending in the U.S. have surged over the past year, with year-over-year growth of 39% and 49%, respectively. We believe that there is evidence to suggest that many brick-and-mortar retail stores have migrated sales to online platforms this past year. In their same Adobe Digital Economy Index Report, as of March 31, 2021, Adobe Analytics is projecting that global e-commerce sales are on pace to hit $4.2 trillion for calendar year-end 2021.
 
By 2025, the value of the worldwide fashion jewelry market is expected to drive approximately $300 billion in worldwide sales according to a November 2020 report from Statista, a global provider of retail market and consumer driven data. We continue to believe that the convergence of the online jewelry consumer, coupled with the emergence of lab-created gemstones, is a solution for the ethically minded consumer that continues to present what we believe is a sizeable opportunity for the Charles & Colvard brand.
 
Our Strategic Outlook
 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present business challenges in 2021 and we expect those challenges to continue into our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, or Fiscal 2022. The full extent of and the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and continues to depend on many factors outside of our control, including, without limitation: the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the development and availability of effective treatments and the long-term impacts of the global vaccine rollout; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Due to the potentially significant impact on our operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including governmental responses to prevent further outbreak of the virus, coupled with the severity of its evolving variants, current period results are not necessarily indicative of expected performance for our full Fiscal 2022. We anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition during Fiscal 2022.
 
Additional risks to the Company related to the COVID-19 pandemic are included in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” A detailed description of the actions we have taken, and are taking, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is included in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
 
Our strategic focus for Fiscal 2022 is centered on the continued expansion of Charles & Colvard’s brand on a global scale and to increase the size of our business through top-line growth. As lab-created gemstones are being embraced by emerging generations, we believe our ability to establish moissanite and the Charles & Colvard brand directly with consumers is key to our future success and ability to fuel our growth. We will execute on our key strategies with a continued commitment to spending judiciously and generating sustainable earnings improvement.
 
Our key strategic goals for Fiscal 2022 are as follows:
 

• | Expansion of Brand Presence. We plan to continue focusing on conversion-based advertising campaigns by way of capitalizing on our existing digital platform and transactional website, charlesandcolvard.com. We believe that we also have the ability to utilize new technological functionality to engage our social media audience on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, among others, by showcasing our products in real time through available existing online video streaming and live stream broadcasting platforms. In furtherance of our brand presence, we expect to continue our quest to reach all customers where they shop. To accomplish this, we plan to explore opportunities to develop retail showrooms in order to display and showcase the styles in our exclusive Signature Collection, which will allow those consumers – who want to see, touch, and feel our jewelry in person – an opportunity to engage with our products. We believe these initiatives are the natural progression of our omnichannel marketing strategy and that these programs will continue to expand our brand presence, increase customer engagement, expand our product offerings, and bolster our top-line growth. We believe that the expansion of our brand presence is a key factor in achieving our overall success in Fiscal 2022.

• | Enhanced Customer Engagement. We plan to further develop and expand our existing content production capabilities by building a broadcast studio in our Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, headquarters. We expect a new studio will provide the setting for live streaming capability on our website as well as other social media broadcast channels. We believe a key element of accomplishing this goal during Fiscal 2022 is our arrangement with and the implementation of Bambuser, a leading live streaming global platform with innovative hosting and broadcasting capabilities. This innovative technology will allow us to host live shows and broadcast events for special initiatives and introducing new product collections. We’re excited to join Bambuser’s list of brands such as LVMH, a leading global luxury products group that includes its Louis Vuitton®, Moët & Chandon©, and Hennessy® family of brands. In addition, Bambuser’s list of participating associates also includes such well-known consumer brands as Clarins®, Samsung©, and Adidas®. We expect this relationship to add a new sales channel opportunity for our direct-to-consumer business and encourage personal interaction with our online customer base, while also providing a platform to explore and engage celebrity and social media influencers.

• | Product Development. We intend to explore product development opportunities during Fiscal 2022 to bring forward new product offerings that align with our exclusive brand and core values, just as we did in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, or Fiscal 2021, with Caydia®, our premium brand of lab grown diamonds. We plan to develop and move forward with new proprietary product offerings, styles, and collections as well as an increased breadth of product categories to further meet the needs of existing and new customers. We expect to also continue focusing on the use of recycled metals and employing sustainable practices in order to serve today’s environmentally aware and conscientious consumer. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disciplined Growth. We remain aware of the ongoing challenges and economic uncertainties facing the U.S. and global economies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we intend to continue developing and expanding our technological capabilities to make informed data-driven decisions across all areas of our business and marketing platforms. Consistent with the planned expansion of the Charles & Colvard brand, we also intend to continue exploring strategic alliance relationships with businesses in the retail and fine jewelry industry where we believe that we would be able to capitalize on existing market synergies and likeminded product brands to help us achieve desired market growth. In the meantime, we plan to continue building an organic growth strategy through a dedication to our existing core product market and providing ongoing exemplary customer service. We will continue to engage with our shareholder base to help create value for our shareholders. To accomplish our long-term strategy for growth, we intend to continue focusing on disciplined growth opportunities that are both complementary and accretive in pursuit of our plans for long-term shareholder value and growth.

Distributing to the Online Channels Segment
 
Driven by continuously updated knowledge of our audience, through e-commerce and web analytics as well as research through social media and customer service channels, we proactively engage our consumers through a multi-channel digital marketing strategy. Our goal is to continue growing our direct relationship with the consumer, which we believe will drive interest across all of our selling channels.
 
Our approach for marketing directly to the consumer in our Online Channels segment includes the following types of communication channels: (i) organic social media; (ii) paid advertising (including, but not limited to, search engine marketing, display ads, video ads, and social media advertising); (iii) email; (iv) public relations; (v) product and style influencers; (vi) digital content creators; and (vii) our own website. In addition, our marketing approach comprises the following types of content types: (i) photography; (ii) videos; (iii) interactive immersive experiences (including but not limited to, online personal concierge shopping assistance and streaming live broadcast events and video shopping opportunities); and (iv) user-generated content.
 
Equally as important to us as marketing to our direct consumer audience is encouraging our customers to move through the process of engaging with our brand – and eventually converting them into a lifetime Charles & Colvard customer. Throughout our marketing tactics, we employ calls to action that drive the consumer to the many virtual and actual locations where they can view our products, initiate, and complete their purchases. We utilize a centralized distribution and fulfillment facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to fulfill Online Channels segment orders.

Following are our principal online transactional channels:
 

• | charlesandcolvard.com. We believe that we continue to enhance our primary transactional website to optimize the platform for the online mobile consumer – whether shopping on a computer at home or a mobile device – and to improve our customers’ experiences. Programs such as free shipping, a 60-day returns policy, and an enhanced and personalized shopping experience have been and will continue to be improved and rolled out over time. With data collected through web analytics, and through user surveys that reveal how consumers use the site, we are in a continual state of optimizing the buying experience – making it easier for shoppers to browse, sort, and compare. Where possible, we utilize these data to inform the selection of new, innovative technologies to further enhance our users’ experience, including technologies provided by such partners as Amazon Pay, Affirm, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc., or PayPal, for financing purchases, Braintree, a service of PayPal, for ease of transfer, and Flow Commerce, Inc., or Flow, which is a company that specializes in facilitating cross-border global trade and e-commerce services. Our goal is to remain continually focused on improving our customers’ experience.

• | moissaniteoutlet.com. On March 16, 2021, we launched our secondary direct-to-consumer website, moissaniteoutlet.com, which is a product disposition channel that we believe complements our global positioning and dominance in the moissanite gemstone market. Our website, moissaniteoutlet.com, is an e-commerce shopping destination that caters to the opportunistic and bargain-seeking consumer base for our moissanite products. We believe this new online property allows us to monetize substantially all our raw material and finished goods inventory, thus minimizing product shrinkage and waste. As a unique online shopping destination with a very different product offering strategy, we believe moissaniteoutlet.com rounds out our product offerings with quality discounted jewelry products allowing us to serve a broader range of demographics and consumers. Our product assortment on moissaniteoutlet.com includes moissanite rings, earrings, pendants, and bracelets, as well as jewelry set with colored moissanite, and other lab created colored gemstones. From time to time, we plan to continue featuring daily pricing deals and flash product sales on moissaniteoutlet.com to encourage consumers to take advantage of favorable pricing opportunities.

• | Cross-Border Trade. Through the ongoing application of cross-border trade, or CBT, technology, such as building our relationship with Flow, we believe CBT continues being a significant opportunity in Fiscal 2022 and beyond. We believe that Flow’s technological platform helps such global enterprises create a positive and localized shopping experience for their international customers while helping to provide a complete and accurate record of CBT transactions for the enterprise. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marketplaces. We continue seeing a large majority of buyers start their online shopping experience utilizing a worldwide web search. In fact, according to jumpshot®, a global content management and digital intelligence firm that tracks marketplace data, more than 50% of those web searches continue to originate on Amazon. That number continues skewing even higher within the Millennial demographic in that Amazon is the web search brand Millennials continue to identify as most relevant based on a finding by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan fact-based think tank. Therefore, we have made a point to maintain a prominent presence on Amazon, achieving Seller-Fulfilled Prime status, which means we have the option of fulfilling orders with the same benefits of Amazon Prime. This continues to enable us to be positioned more prominently in Amazon’s search platform and to take advantage of their negotiated shipping rates and service levels that, in turn, lowers our overall shipping costs. This status is available by Amazon to only those sellers who have a history of fulfilling orders quickly and maintaining appropriate levels of stock. Our marketplace relationship with Amazon includes, in addition to domestic websites, international locations, including websites in the U.K., Europe, Australia, and Japan. We also continue to have a market presence on eBay and a multitude of other specialty marketplaces, allowing us to meet our customers when and where they want to buy. As the world and its economy is beginning to recover from the pandemic, our goal remains to continue optimizing our presence on these marketplaces and to continue expanding into new untapped regions and platforms where we have identified cost-effective opportunities.

• | Pure-Play E-tailers. FTI Consulting, a global business advisory firm, continues to project that at least 25% of total retail sales will become e-commerce centric by 2030. As consumers continue maintaining an online shopping presence and become more digitally savvy, new businesses have gained traction by tailoring their product, services, and experiences to specific consumer preferences. We believe that these pure-play e-tailers offer unique opportunities for Charles & Colvard to feature our gemstones and connect with their loyal audiences.

• | Drop Ship Retail. In an effort to expand their product offerings and assortments, many retailers utilize direct fulfillment from their vendors to their consumers, or drop-ship, as it enables them to offer a more robust assortment online without having to physically take ownership of the goods in their warehouse. These retailers often seek socially and environmentally responsible brands to serve the demand for conscientious product selection from their audiences. Since we began direct-to-consumer drop-shipping products in 2013, we have refined our digital information technology and operations capabilities to support these partnering arrangements in multiple ways, including fully integrated electronic data interchange, or EDI, solutions for inventory management, order processing, and invoicing. Operationally, we continue maintaining in-stock rates and leveraging our centralized distribution and fulfillment facility to meet partner service-level agreements, or SLAs, for shipments and returns. We plan to continue seeking new and strategic alliance relationships as well as optimizing existing arrangements throughout Fiscal 2022 and beyond.

Distributing to the Traditional Segment
 
The Traditional segment is our legacy segment – represented by such outlets as manufacturers, distributors, and brick-and-mortar retailers. Going forward, these market channels remain important avenues for Charles & Colvard to drive product to market and be present in the many places the consumer takes his or her shopping journey.
 
Our approach for marketing to customers and strategic partners within our Traditional segment includes the following types of communication channels: (i) trade advertising; (ii) industry associations; (iii) trade shows; and (iv) cooperative advertising.
 
We utilize a centralized distribution and fulfillment facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to fill bulk orders to manufacturer, distributor, and retail customers.
 

• | Retail. In order to create awareness and exposure for our gemstones, jewelry, and brands, we sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale prices to nationally recognized and emerging retail customers through a broad range of channels including jewelry chains and department stores. Wholesale orders are received by way of purchase orders and fulfilled from our centralized fulfillment center. In many cases, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory in stores on a consignment basis. Under this consignment model, in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policy, we recognize the revenue for these transactions after the retail partner has sold an item to a consumer or other contractual conditions are met. In other cases, a retailer purchases the goods, or a portion of the goods, under what we call an asset purchase model. Under our asset model, we recognize the sale and related revenue upon transfer of the goods to the retailer. Due to the maturity of certain retail relationships, we have migrated select brick-and mortar partners to a blended asset and consignment model account structure, which affords us more favorable customer payment terms that result in more favorable cash flow. We will continue to evolve our retail channel strategy as we optimize our methods and partnering arrangements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Domestic Manufacturers and Distributors. In order to service the vast number of independent jewelers, jewelry stores, and smaller jewelry chains, we sell our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry to domestic wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers at distributor prices, that in turn resell the loose jewels or finished jewelry at a markup to independent jewelers and jewelry stores – whether brick-and-mortar, online, or both. In limited circumstances, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory with select domestic distributors on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for domestic distributors, which may result in a change to our historical domestic distributor methods and partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | International Manufacturers and Distributors. In order to create global awareness and exposure for our lab created gemstones, jewelry, and brands, we sell loose moissanite and lab created diamond gems, as well as finished jewelry featuring these gemstones, to international wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers at distributor prices, that in turn sell the actual loose jewels or set the loose jewels in mountings and sell the finished jewelry to brick-and-mortar and online retailers. We currently have numerous international wholesale distributors based in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Africa. Some of these distributors typically sell into neighboring countries and the extended geographic regions where they may be located. Additionally, from time to time, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory with select international distributors on a consignment basis. Notwithstanding the impact of the ongoing worldwide pandemic, we continue to evaluate our channel strategy for international distributors, which may result in a change to our historical international distributor methods and strategic partners. A portion of our international sales consists of finished jewels sold internationally that may be re-imported to U.S. retailers.

Seasonality
 
Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the calendar year-end holiday season and during other holiday periods such as Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, and Mother’s Day. Because historically we have primarily sold our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite, and now more recently sell gemstones and finished jewelry featuring our premium lab grown diamonds, at wholesale pricing to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, our sales to support the holiday season have largely taken place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters, depending on the sales channel and the level of advanced planning and production our customers undertook. However, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution and the level of current inventory positions held by our customers. In recent years, we experience a higher degree of seasonality in the fourth calendar quarter than we have experienced in prior years primarily as a result of the increased calendar year-end holiday season sales to end consumers through our Online Channels segment. In future periods, as direct to consumer sales of our finished jewelry featuring both moissanite and lab grown diamonds increase – both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales – we anticipate a seasonality trend more typical with the retail jewelry industry, and these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.
Moissanite
 
Over 120 years ago, Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Henri Moissan, Ph.D., first discovered the extremely rare mineral SiC in a meteorite crater in Arizona. Over a century after the discovery of SiC, and after years of experimentation, researchers from the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina developed and patented a thermal growing process for creating pure SiC crystals in a controlled laboratory environment. This long-sought-after breakthrough made possible the world’s first lab-created moissanite gemstone – posthumously named after its discoverer. With hardness rivaling any mineral on earth, and optical properties exceeding all mined and created gemstones, we believe moissanite is a brilliant jewel that is free from environmental and ethical issues, and capable of disrupting traditional definitions of fine jewelry.
 
Naturally occurring moissanite is generally very small in size, dark green or black in color, and not a commercially viable source of gemstone material. Therefore, in order to create high quality moissanite material in desirable colors and across a range of carat sizes that will appeal to a consumer audience, we expect only lab-grown SiC crystals to provide a sustainable source of moissanite for gemstones. In addition to carat size, important characteristics of a gemstone are beauty, durability, and rarity. The beauty of a colorless or near-colorless gemstone is characterized by its color, brilliance, and fire. The brilliance of a gemstone is measured by its refractive index, or the extent to which, when coupled with the facet design, the gemstone reflects light. The fire of a gemstone, or the breaking of light rays into spectral colors, is measured by its dispersion. Durability is determined by a gemstone’s hardness, or resistance to scratching and toughness, or resistance to chipping or cleaving. Rarity is the availability or perceived availability of a gemstone. Moissanite jewels have a unique combination of brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity.

The following table compares the physical properties of moissanite jewels with other fine gemstone materials, including lab grown diamonds:
 
 
Description | Refractive Index | | Dispersion | | Hardness (1) | Toughness
-------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+------------+-------+--------------+----------
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® | | 2.65-2.69 | | 0.104 | | | 9.25 – 9.5 | Excellent 
Diamond (including mined and lab grown diamonds) | | 2.42 | | 0.044 | | | 10 | Good to Excellent (2) 
Ruby | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent (3) 
Sapphire | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent (3) 
Emerald | | 1.58 | | 0.014 | | | 7.50 | Poor to Good 



(1) For purposes of this table, “hardness” is based on the Mohs Scale, which is a relative scale only. Quantitative comparisons of different gemstone materials cannot be made directly using the Mohs Scale. Moissanite jewels, while harder than all other known gemstones, are approximately one-half as hard as diamond.
 (2) In cleavage direction, toughness is “good”.
 (3) Except twinned stones

Moissanite’s beauty is objectively derived from its refractive index, which is higher than any other gemstone, including diamond. And its hardness is greater than all minerals, and all known gemstone materials with the exception of diamond. As a result, moissanite jewels, like diamond, can be cut with sharp, well-defined, and highly polished facets that accentuate their brilliance and fire. The cutting specifications (facet arrangement and proportions) for moissanite jewels are different than any other gemstone and designed to maximize the brilliance and fire of the raw material.
 
We evaluate the finished gems to exacting standards with automated video-imaging equipment using internal and independent third-party certified gemologists. Due to the rare natural occurrence of moissanite and both the proprietary and technical limitations in producing mass quantities of gem-grade moissanite, we believe that moissanite is among the rarest of jewels.
 
Lab Grown Diamond
 
Lab grown diamond materials have been synthesized since the early 1940s and eventually made their way into industrial applications during the next decade. Originally, this process was used mainly for producing diamond products used in industrial applications such as for diamond-tipped drill bits and commercial-grade abrasives as well as products used for unique specialized surgical equipment within the medical field. In 1955, scientists discovered a way to duplicate the conditions in a laboratory setting under which diamonds naturally develop. Inside a high-pressure cell, carbon atoms are subjected to intense heat and pressure, until the atoms grow and crystalize on seed crystals as a man-made diamond. More recently, an advanced technological method for creating diamonds, known as chemical vapor deposition, or CVD, mimics the method of natural diamond formations. CVD uses extreme pressure and a heated mixture of methane and hydrogen to produce gemstone quality lab grown diamonds that are used in the fine jewelry industry. Lab grown diamonds are cut and polished in the same manner as natural diamonds, producing identically optical, physical, and chemical properties as their mined diamond counterpart. The gemstone physical properties table set forth above denotes the range of physical attributes that are consistent for both mined and lab grown diamonds.

Many misconceptions exist surrounding lab grown diamonds. The most-asked question we receive regarding lab gown diamonds is whether or not lab grown diamonds are considered to be real diamonds. In response to this question, we unequivocally believe that lab grown diamonds are 100% real. We contend that the main difference between lab grown diamonds and those that are mined is simply the origin of the diamond itself. The critical characteristics of a diamond, those being its appearance, its chemical composition, and its physical properties are exactly the same in both a diamond that is mined versus one that is grown in a laboratory. A lab grown diamond can only be distinguished from natural diamonds using specialized equipment that can detect the minor differences in trace elements and crystal growth.
 
Products and Product Development
 
Moissanite Jewels
 
Historically, Charles & Colvard primarily sold legacy moissanite jewels including Forever Classic™ and Forever Brilliant®. In 2015, we announced availability of our premier product, the first colorless moissanite jewel, Forever One™, which grades from colorless (D-E-F) to near-colorless (G-H-I) using the GIA’s color grading scale. Our limited launch was met with enthusiasm from channel partners and consumers. In response to this demand, we continue to expand our Forever One™ product line with additional shapes and sizes. Today, we offer Forever One™ in 27 cuts, and a multitude of sizes ranging from melee accent stones as small as 0.002 carats to gemstones up to 6.13 carats, and our Exotics line of products that are as large as 15.55 carats diamond equivalent weight, or DEW.
 
In May 2018, we announced the availability of a new grade of gemstone, Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®. We believe that, with the exception of our own colorless moissanite jewel, Forever One™, our latest gemstone is a cut above other moissanite on the market. The distinction between Forever One™ and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® is made through our applied expertise throughout the design and manufacturing process summarized below and described in more detail in “Manufacturing and Quality Assurance”. We believe that due to the discerning approach we take to ensure the quality of Forever One™, it remains far above any other offering available today. By closely evaluating clarity, color, and cut, we are able to determine which gemstones meet our exemplary standards for Forever One™, and those that fit within one of the classifications for our multiple grade Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones.
 
Our manufacturing process starts with SiC material primarily manufactured by Cree through its patented process. This proprietary growing process creates a SiC material that is nearly free of micropipes – a type of inclusion sometimes found in lab-grown SiC material. However, based on the terms of the amended Supply Agreement with our strategic partner, we are permitted to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. Either way, the SiC material comes to us as a boule, or a formed mass, that has the atomic structure of a single crystal. After beginning our manufacturing process, each boule is carefully inspected by our certified gemologists to ensure it meets our minimum standards for Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® gemstones, including those for clarity and color grades. The products that meet appropriate minimum quality standards move forward on the journey to become our Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® gemstones. From this point, as the product continues to move through our manufacturing process, it is subjected to further processing steps, such as cutting, faceting, and finishing. At the end of our manufacturing process, it’s the clarity and color designation, coupled with further inspection by our certified gemologists regarding the quality levels of the cutting, faceting, and finishing processes, that will ultimately determine if the product becomes one of our premier Forever One™ gemstones or one our multiple grade Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones.
 
Moissanite Finished Jewelry
 
We began selling finished jewelry featuring moissanite in 2010. Our core designs included stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets. We are now selling an expanded selection of fashion-oriented, designer-inspired moissanite jewelry that we offer as an expansion to the core line of jewelry. The primary components of our moissanite finished jewelry are loose moissanite jewels that we have on hand as part of our finished goods inventory, precious metal settings, and labor to mount the jewels into the settings.
Source of Moissanite Raw Material
 
Our moissanite jewels are made from gem-grade SiC crystals. Our primary supplier of SiC crystals is Cree with which we have certain exclusive supply rights for SiC crystals to be used for gemstone applications. In addition, based on the terms of the Supply Agreement with Cree, as amended, described below, we are permitted to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. We source the metals used for our finished jewelry, including white, yellow, and rose gold, platinum, tantalum, and sterling silver, from a number of domestic and international manufacturers located in the U.S., China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, Vietnam, or Portugal. In line with our goal of providing socially and ethically sourced products, we require suppliers to adhere to our stringent supplier guidelines, as well as to certify that their gold and tantalum are coming from conflict free sources and that all precious metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced.

Exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree
 
On December 12, 2014, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with Cree, or the Supply Agreement, which superseded and replaced our prior agreement with Cree. Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Cree, and Cree agreed to exclusively supply 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the Supply Agreement was scheduled to expire on June 24, 2018. Effective June 22, 2018, the Supply Agreement was amended to extend the expiration date to June 25, 2023. The Supply Agreement was also amended to (i) provide us with one option, subject to certain conditions, to unilaterally extend the term of the Supply Agreement for an additional two-year period following expiration of the initial term; (ii) establish a process by which Cree may begin producing alternate SiC material based on our specifications that will give us the flexibility to use the materials in a broader variety of our products; and (iii) permit us to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. On August 26, 2020, the Supply Agreement was further amended, effective June 30, 2020, to extend the expiration date to June 29, 2025, which may be further extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. The Supply Agreement was also amended to, among other things, (i) spread our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement in the amount of approximately $52.95 million over the term of the Supply Agreement, as amended; (ii) establish a process by which Cree has agreed to accept purchase orders in excess of the agreed-upon minimum purchase commitment, subject to certain conditions; and (iii) permit us to purchase revised amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions.
 
We believe that our Supply Agreement with Cree, which holds the U.S. patent for micropipe-free silicon carbide material and the related method of manufacture, provides us a superior quality core material above all other moissanite and one that possesses an unrivaled level of gemstone clarity. We also believe that the terms and conditions contained within the amended Supply Agreement are overall more favorable when compared with those in the Supply Agreement prior to the amendments. Our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement, as amended, until June 2025 is approximately $52.95 million, of which approximately $32.85 remains to be purchased as of June 30, 2021.
 
For more information regarding the second amendment to our Supply Agreement, executed on August 26, 2020, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Lab Grown Diamonds
 
On September 14, 2020, we announced our expansion into the lab grown diamond product market with the launch of Caydia®, an exclusive brand of premium lab grown diamonds. Our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are hand selected by our GIA certified gemologists to meet Charles & Colvard’s standards and validated by independent third-party experts. Our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are available currently in E, F, and G color grades (based on the GIA’s color grading scale) with a minimum clarity in accordance with the GIA’s VS1 clarity classification along with excellent cut, polish, and symmetry. All of our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are set with responsibly sourced precious metals.
 
Lab Grown Diamond Finished Jewelry
 
We began offering finished jewelry featuring our Caydia® premium lab grown diamonds in September 2020. In addition to our core designs that include stud earrings, solitaire and multiple-gemstone rings, pendants, and bracelets, we are also selling a curated assortment of designer inspired luxury fashion finished jewelry featuring our Caydia® premium lab grown diamonds. The primary components of our Caydia® lab grown diamond finished jewelry are loose lab grown diamond jewels that we have either (i) purchased and have on hand from a core select group of lab grown diamond suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers or (ii) purchase directly from the same select group of lab grown diamond suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers for assembly with responsibly sourced precious metal settings that includes the cost of labor to mount the lab grown diamond jewels into the settings.

Sources of Lab Grown Diamond Raw Material
 
Our premium lab grown diamonds are made by third-party manufacturers from what we believe is the most technologically advanced method for laboratory created gemstone quality diamonds used in the fine jewelry industry. We purchase our lab grown diamonds from established domestic suppliers that comprises a supply chain, which we believe has proven to meet our rigid and quality certified standards and timelines to meet our inventory supply needs. We source the metals used for finished jewelry set with our Caydia® lab grown diamonds, including white, yellow, and rose gold, platinum, tantalum, and sterling silver, from a number of domestic and international manufacturers located in the U.S., China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, Vietnam, or Portugal. In line with our goal of providing socially and ethically sourced products, we require suppliers to adhere to our stringent supplier guidelines, as well as to certify that their gold and tantalum are coming from conflict free sources and that all precious metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced.
Intellectual Property
 
We held a number of U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels that expired during 2015, under which we had broad, exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell moissanite jewels in the U.S. We held these same patents in 25 foreign jurisdictions, primarily across Asia and Europe, that expired in 2016, with one remaining in Mexico that expired in Fiscal 2021. In addition, we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support our moissanite branding strategy. Additionally, we have certain issued design patents that we believe will differentiate our products in the gemstone and jewelry industry. Since the expiration of our patents, we have noted new providers of moissanite entering the market. We know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of SiC-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, we do not anticipate significant direct moissanite competition in our superior quality gemstone ranges with consistent production volumes.
 
Our success and our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our proprietary technology. In addition to our design patents, we rely on trade secret laws and employee, consultant, and customer confidentiality agreements to protect certain aspects of our technology. We currently are not subject to any claims that our products or processes infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. At the present time, we are also dependent on Cree’s technology for the production of SiC crystals.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
Moissanite Jewels
 
The production of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® jewels is an elaborate process developed over a number of years of collaborative research and development, acquired and learned knowledge from scientists, and considerable investment expense.
 
Following are the key steps involved in the manufacturing processes of our moissanite jewels:
 

• | Growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals;
--+------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing rough preforms;
--+------------------------------


• | Faceting and polishing jewels;
--+-------------------------------


• | Inspecting, sorting, and grading; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | Engraving.
--+-----------

 
Growing Gem-Grade Raw SiC Crystals. SiC crystal growth suitable for gem-grade usage at commercial quantities is proprietary both in design and in operational methodology. Cree has grown the majority of our SiC crystals in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement. We routinely evaluate the yield and quality of saleable moissanite jewels from SiC crystals. The yield of saleable jewels from each crystal is one of the most significant factors affecting the volume and cost of moissanite jewels available for sale. Yield is dependent on the quality of the crystals, and variations in crystal quality can adversely affect our gross margin percentage.
 
 11
 
Manufacturing Rough Preforms. We have made considerable investment in the design, development, and customization of a proprietary manufacturing process that includes equipment, software, and procedures to maximize raw material yield. The result is production of intermediary shapes, called “preforms,” that vary depending upon the size and shape of the desired finished jewel. Currently, we are not spending research and development funds in connection with these processes. However, when potential technology aligns with our production business model, we intend to explore and potentially invest in such research and development resources to improve raw material yield, including studying alternate preform shapes and cutting technologies, due to the dramatic effect such an improvement could have on our gross margin percentage.
 
Faceting and Polishing Jewels. Each preform is faceted and polished by our independent third-party gem-cutters to create what we believe to be our uniquely faceted Revolutionary Cut™ gemstones based on master designs with multiple quality control measures built into the process. Gem-cutter training is a regimented program involving several months of progressive hands-on bench training. As we continue to expand the assortment of Forever One™, we will continue the process of certifying additional cutters to ensure sufficient scalability of our production capabilities to meet anticipated demand for this premium finished jewel.
 
Inspecting, Sorting, and Grading. Similar to other gemstones, each faceted moissanite jewel greater than 3.5 millimeters in size is individually graded against established master standards using our specially trained personnel. Additionally, as part of our overall quality assurance program, a representative sample from each batch of jewels is submitted to an image analyzer to ensure critical angles and other attributes designed to maximize moissanite’s optical properties are consistently maintained. This phase of manufacturing is relatively labor-intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force. In the future, we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to independent third parties that we will require to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards.
 
Engraving. For moissanite gemstones that are four millimeters and larger in size, with certain exceptions Charles & Colvard laser inscribes an identifying code on the girdle of each Forever One™ and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstone that includes the Charles & Colvard Floret logo. This identifier matches a grading standard and is an important element in protecting the integrity of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® and ensuring the customer an authentic Charles & Colvard gemstone.
 
Moissanite Finished Jewelry
 
Our line of finished jewelry featuring moissanite is developed by a team of industry experts integrating our moissanite jewels into many forms of jewelry, generally made of precious metals, either designed or purchased by us utilizing a core group of suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers. In addition to our Limited Lifetime Warranty offered on our moissanite jewels, we provide a twelve-month Limited Warranty on all finished jewelry featuring our moissanite, and on jewelry designs that do not contain our moissanite gemstones, such as men’s wedding bands.
 
All procured finished jewelry components are sourced from our approved suppliers, and each finished jewelry item is jobbed and/or tracked by stock keeping unit, or SKU, utilizing our enterprise resource planning system. The components of moissanite finished jewelry comprised in each job are then manufactured into finished jewelry by assemblers either in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, Vietnam, or Portugal. We are continuously working with our existing manufacturing partners, as well as identifying new manufacturing partners, to expand our assortments and efficiencies.
 
All finished jewelry produced by Charles & Colvard undergoes a multi-point inspection process. A representative sampling of manufactured finished jewelry items undergoes stone and metals testing to ensure that the items for sale are of the quality that we strive to maintain. Also, in line with our goal of providing socially and ethically sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold and tantalum to certify that the gold and tantalum is coming from conflict free sources and that all precious metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced. If required by government ordinance or requested by a customer, we facilitate the inspection of our finished jewelry by internationally recognized testing facilities to comply with legal requirements and to ensure consumer confidence.

All of our Caydia® lab grown diamonds are set with mostly recycled precious metals.
 
Working Capital Practices
 
Our primary source of working capital is cash on hand and cash generated by our operations. As global and U.S economic activity continues evolving in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of constraints on our cash and working capital, including experiencing potential liquidity challenges, remains in the forefront of our working capital management practices. Despite our cost-saving efforts, many business and operating expenses have remained flat or continued to rise. Cash flow management will remain crucial for our business in the months ahead and we intend to monitor fluctuations in our revenues that could impact our ongoing cash flow from operations. We expect to remain proactive in managing our inventory levels given the uncertainty in the worldwide supply chain, which may also place further demands on our level of working capital. Because we have quarterly minimum purchase commitments under the Supply Agreement, we may be required to purchase SiC materials in excess of our immediate needs from time to time, which may result in inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain.
 
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that allows us to periodically offer and sell, individually or in any combination, shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock, and units consisting of any combination of the foregoing types of securities, up to a total of $25.00 million, of which all is available. However, we may offer and sell no more than one-third of our public float (which is the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates) in any 12-month period.  Our ability to issue equity securities under the shelf registration statement is subject to market conditions, which may be in turn, subject to, among other things, the potential disruption and volatility that may be caused by ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 13
 
In June 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.60 per share, which, together with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option for an additional 630,500 shares in July, resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $9.99 million, net of the underwriting discount and fees and expenses.
 
Payment terms on trade receivables for our Traditional segment customers are generally between 30 and 90 days, though we may offer extended terms with specific customers and on significant orders from time to time. We extend credit to our customers based upon a number of factors, including an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and credit history that is verified through trade association reference services, the customer’s payment history with us, the customer’s reputation in the trade, and/or an evaluation of the customer’s opportunity to introduce our moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds or finished jewelry featuring both moissanite and lab grown diamonds to new or expanded markets.
 
Our returns policy for consumers on our charlesandcolvard.com and moissaniteoutlet.com websites provides for the return of purchases for any reason generally within 60 days and 30 days, respectively, of the shipment date. Our returns policy for all other customers allows for the return of moissanite jewels, lab grown diamonds, and finished jewelry for credit generally within 30 days of shipment if returned for a valid reason. We have established an allowance for returns based on our historical return rate, which takes into account any contractual return privileges granted to our customers. Periodically, we ship loose gemstones and finished jewelry goods inventory to Traditional segment customers on consignment terms. Under these terms, the customer assumes the risk of loss and has an absolute right of return for a specified period that typically ranges from six months to one year.
 
Competition
 
As competitive moissanite and lab grown diamonds expand and grow their global market presence, we believe that it is important to affirm Charles & Colvard’s leadership position as a provider of the premier worldwide moissanite gemstone as well as an exclusive brand of premium lab grown diamonds. Moving forward, we believe that we are well positioned to further establish our presence for both of our product lines in the worldwide emerging markets. We also believe our leadership position in these global markets is a product of more than 25 years of moissanite innovation and as a purveyor of fine jewelry.
 
Accordingly, we believe our competitive advantage is bolstered by the following strengths:
 

• | With our Forever One™ gemstones, we believe that we have achieved a level of perfection that is rarely seen in any gemstone – featuring colorless grades with an innovative cut that we believe reveals optical properties unrivaled by any other jewel. This pinnacle of our legacy production process is the result of continual improvement and a demonstration of our artisan craftsmanship. Additionally, we believe that with our Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones we have brought forward a price-conscious alternative to competitive moissanite that we believe exceeds the quality of competitive moissanite – specifically in terms of clarity, as well as in cut and polish. The distinction between Forever One™ and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® is made through our applied expertise throughout the design and manufacturing processes and the discerning approach we believe we take to ensure the quality of Forever One™ remains above any other offering available today. By closely evaluating clarity, color, and cut, we are able to determine which gemstones meet our exemplary standards for Forever One™ and those that should bear the Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® name.

• | With our significant inventory and an established supply chain, we believe we are positioned to meet the just-in-time needs of our distribution partners. We believe having inventory quantities on the shelf is paramount to meeting the challenging delivery requirements of our customers. As we continue to balance our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to effectively manage our inventory levels given the potential uncertainty in consumer demand and in our supply chain. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With our above strengths outlined, it is also important to note that our future competitive success is reliant, in part, on the following:
 

• | Our continued success in developing and promoting the Charles & Colvard brands, such as Forever One™, Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, and Caydia®, all of which are used in finished fine jewelry featuring moissanite and lab grown diamonds, resulting in increased interest and demand for moissanite and lab grown diamond jewelry at the consumer level;

Competitive Gemstones and Jewelry
 
Gemstone materials can be grouped into three types:
 

• | Those found in nature, generally through mining techniques;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synthetic gemstones, which have the same chemical composition and essentially the same physical and optical characteristics of natural gemstones but are created or grown in a laboratory; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simulants, which are similar in appearance to natural gemstones but do not have the same chemical composition, physical properties, or optical characteristics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Moissanite is a rare, naturally occurring mineral. Our lab-created gemstones, Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®, are considered a synthetic version of the naturally occurring moissanite mineral. Our exclusive brand of premium lab grown diamonds, Caydia®, are also considered a synthetic version of a natural diamond that is mined.
 
Our moissanite jewels and lab grown diamonds compete with fine gemstones such as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and tanzanite as well as with mined natural diamonds. We also face competition from synthetic diamonds, synthetic diamond films, and other sources of moissanite gemstones. Some suppliers of diamonds, including lab grown diamonds, and other fine gemstones, as well as the suppliers of other synthetic and lab-created gemstones, may have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do.
 
Competing with Other Moissanite Producers
 
Although we believe that our moissanite jewels have a leadership market position, we are beginning to face competition from other companies that develop competing SiC material. These products are emerging primarily from Far Eastern countries and are making their way into the U.S. market. Our ongoing research of the competitive landscape has identified competing moissanite, primarily in the “E-F” and below color range, according to the GIA’s grading scale. However, we have not yet identified competing moissanite that exhibits a consistent level of color, cut, clarity and polish that is competitive with the quality of our Forever One™ gemstone.
 
We also have not identified competitive sources that have exhibited the ability to supply a consistent and high volume of quality moissanite substantial enough to address the considerable consumption needs of distributors and retailers that serve the jewelry trade. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of SiC-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain.
 
However, we are seeing a grade of moissanite material reaching the market that exhibits a lower color rating and/or lesser cut, clarity and polish standard compared to our Forever One™ gemstone. This inferior product is coming to market at competitive price points, and we have subsequently been experiencing downward pricing pressures from price-sensitive purchasing channels. In 2018, we entered this market with a value line of moissanite to compete directly with these lower grade moissanite products. Our product line, known as Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, is a competitively priced line of gemstones that is fashioned from the same core material as our other created moissanite products. Finished gemstones that do not meet our grading standards for Forever One™ – but do meet our specifications for gemstones worthy of carrying the Charles & Colvard name – are offered to the market at a value priced option. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, approximately 15% of our revenue was generated from Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones and finished jewelry – we believe this percentage of revenue is validating the market for this value-priced product line.

Competing with Lab-Grown Diamonds
 
Lab-created diamond material has been synthesized since the early 1940s and made its way into industrial processes by the 1950s. Common applications such as diamond-tipped drill bits and abrasive processes led the way, followed by uses in solid-state electronics. In more recent years, lab grown diamonds have become accepted as a form of gemstone with companies such as Diamond Foundry, Pure Grown Diamonds and Lab Diamonds Direct gaining notoriety in the market.
 
Consumer demand is driving the charge behind this recent adoption of lab grown gemstones in the modern global luxury fashion jewelry space. Today’s discerning consumer is seeking ethically sourced options, better price points, and authenticity in the brands they choose to engage. We believe the recent rise in interest for the lab created diamond has created an increased interest in the moissanite gemstone market. With the launch of our Caydia® product line, an exclusive brand of premium lab grown diamonds, we believe that our entry into the lab grown diamond market could be a potential threat to - and increase competition for - our core moissanite products. While our moissanite gemstones and finished jewelry set with moissanite generally have different price points than those with lab grown diamonds, including our Caydia® product line, any cannibalization of moissanite product sales resulting from sales of our lab grown diamonds could have an adverse impact on sales of our moissanite jewels and finished jewelry set with moissanite.
 
Since our entry into the lab grown diamond space, we have experienced growing traffic and interest in Charles & Colvard from the ongoing attention around lab-created gemstones. We may face future price point and consumer related demand pressures from the lab grown diamond industry. However, with current moissanite pricing averaging between 5% and 10% of mined diamond gemstones and between 20% and 25% of lab grown diamonds, we believe that for the foreseeable future we will continue to be able to serve and thrive in this segment of the market.
 
Competing with Mined Diamonds
 
The worldwide market for large, uncut, high-quality mined diamonds is significantly consolidated and controlled by the De Beers Group of Companies, or De Beers (headquartered in South Africa), Alrosa Group (Russia), Rio Tinto Limited (Australia), and BHP Group Limited (Australia). These companies have a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of mined diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels. While moissanite trades at a fraction of the cost of mined diamonds, diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the mined diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of competing goods such as moissanite jewels.
 
Competing with Simulants
 
While moissanite is a synthetic gemstone (a lab-created version of the naturally occurring SiC mineral), we may also, to a lesser degree, face competition from simulant gemstones, including cubic zirconia and man-made crystals. Producers and sellers of these products may see the markets for these products being eroded by the market penetration of our moissanite jewels. We believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels; however, they are not considered fine gemstone or jewelry products.
Competing in the Finished Jewelry Space
 
The global fine jewelry market competition is fierce. Such well-known jewelry designers and manufacturers as James Allen®, Brilliant Earth, LLC, and Blue Nile Inc., among others, have a variety of jewelry collections featuring diamond and other precious and semi-precious gemstones, and enjoy strong brand recognition and a loyal consumer following. These companies also have greater financial resources than we do to develop and market their products.
 
We intend to expand our market share and compete with these well-known brands primarily on the basis of the combination of quality, design, and value, as moissanite is the highest quality, affordable alternative available to more expensive gemstones such as diamond. We believe that focusing on the clear advantages in moissanite’s retail price points, especially in the one-carat and larger sizes, will provide a key point of differentiation and value proposition to the end consumer who may not have had the opportunity to previously purchase fine jewelry due to limitations in discretionary spending income.

In addition, we believe that the Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® suite, including moissanite jewels such as Forever One™ and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, along with moissanite finished jewelry that we are developing pursuant to our marketing programs, as well as the line of finished jewelry featuring our Caydia® lab grown diamonds all combine to create what we believe is a long-term competitive advantage for our products as we continue building brand recognition. We endeavor to partner with recognized designers and jewelry companies, in addition to developing our own proprietary brands of finished jewelry. While our finished jewelry business is still developing, our goal is to build multiple strong brands sought after by the end consumer. We propose to focus our marketing efforts on emphasizing our attractive designs, coupled with moissanite’s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity, to establish moissanite as a primary consumer choice in fine jewelry.
 
Our design, manufacture and marketing of finished jewelry featuring moissanite for sale at wholesale pricing to distributors and retailers and at retail to end consumers through our charlesandcolvard.com and other Online Channels outlets may result in some of our current wholesale customers perceiving us as a competitor, despite our efforts to use primarily non-conflicting sales channels. As we continue to develop our finished jewelry business, we intend to increase distribution through new and existing channels similarly to how many other companies have executed cross-channel marketing and distribution strategies. Due to the size of the finished jewelry market, we believe that such sales channels can co-exist, with the overall end result being increased consumer and brand awareness of moissanite products and a corresponding increased demand for not only our products, but those of our distributor and manufacturer customers as well.
 
Competing with Lab Grown Diamond Retailers
 
Our primary competitors in the lab grown diamond retail market are James Allen®, VRAI by Diamond Foundry, Clean Origin LLC, and Brilliant Earth, LLC. Our offerings are curated to remove the complexity from the diamond buying process by selling only what we believe to be higher quality lab grown diamonds set in our finished jewelry products. Many of these competitors offer a wider quality grade range of lab grown diamonds which are sold separately from those set with lab grown diamonds in finished jewelry. We believe that our pricing strategy remains competitive based on the quality of the Caydia® lab grown diamonds that we offer and sell.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry. In particular, in July 2018 the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, issued updated guidelines governing the description of lab-grown diamonds and other gemstones that require such gemstones to be clearly identified as to the gemstone’s lab-grown origin in any promotional or marketing materials. In addition, the precious metal in our finished jewelry may be subject to requirements, which vary by country and by state, such as hallmarking and alloy content. While we have a policy to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, if our actions are found to be in violation of FTC or other governmental regulations, we may be required to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate governmental regulations.
Human Resources Capital
 
As of August 27, 2021, we had a total of 51 employees, all of whom were full-time and none of whom were part-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
