Item 1. Description of Business
GENERAL
 
Fellazo Corp. (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 28, 2014.
 
During the year ending August 31, 2017 the Company had commenced its transformation process into an IT based company specialized in Mobile Application Developments with worldwide clientele and a portfolio investment company in primary industries such as healthcare, energy, development and capital market.
Our office is located at 8th Floor, Wisma Huazong, Lot 15285, 0.7km Lebuhraya Sungei Besi, 43300 Seri Kembangan, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.
 
As at August 31, 2017, the Company has a working capital deficit of $301,919 and has not yet established a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating cost for the foreseeable future. These factors, among others, may raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
However the Company had commenced its transformation into an IT based company specialized in Mobile Application Developments with worldwide clientele and a portfolio investment company in primary industries such as healthcare, energy, development and capital market. The Board of Director is assisted by a team consisting of highly competent professional consultants and experts in the related the fields during this period of the transformation exercise.
 
We strongly believe that the transformation would bring a significant growth potential to the Company which would generate more than sufficient revenue and liquidity to sustain the Company for the next twelve months and a significant future growth. In addition there will be in-flow of funds and capital injections by the Directors to facilitate this transformation exercise.
 
On July 4, 2017, a private placement exercise was completed with issuance of the balance of shares (70,115,000 shares) within our authorized capital to our existing directors at par value of $0.001 per share.
 
On the 7th and 17th of August 2017, the Company had filed Schedule Pre-14C and Def-14c for an increase in our authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 (one billion) shares of common stock at par value of $0.001 per share following a written consent of majority shareholders on the matter on August 1, 2017.
 
Following the above, on September 19, 2017 amendments to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation had been filed with the Nevada Secretary of State thus increasing the Company’s authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares to 1,000,000,000 (one billion) shares of common stock at par value of $0.001 per share.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
Our President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, Prof. Dr. Wong Kong-Yew and Director of the Company Mr. Yap Kit Chuan are assisted by a personal assistance in our Malaysia office.
 
The Company has yet to have any other full time employee as The Board is assisted by a team consisting of highly competent professional consultants and experts in the related the fields during this period of transformation exercise.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
We will always comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.
