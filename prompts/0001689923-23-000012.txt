Overview
We are a leader in analytics automation. The Alteryx Analytics Automation Platform empowers “analytics for all” by delivering easy, end-to-end automation of data engineering, analytics, reporting, machine learning, and data science processes, enabling enterprises to democratize data analytics across their organizations for a broad range of use cases. Whether working in the cloud or on-premise, data workers, regardless of technical acumen, are empowered to be curious and solve problems. With the Alteryx Analytics Automation Platform, users can automate the full range of analytics and data science processes, embed intelligent decision-making and actions, and empower their organization to enable top and bottom-line impact, efficiency gains, and rapid upskilling.
Uncovering actionable insights from data is critical to modern business success, but has become increasingly challenging as the volume, velocity, and variety of data continues to expand. Traditional data analysis tools and processes can be slow, complex, difficult to use, and resource-intensive, often requiring multiple steps by data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, information technology, or IT, employees, and other data workers to complete even the most basic analysis. As a result, these point tools and processes are often unable to keep pace with the sophistication and speed of analytics demanded by organizations today.
Our platform democratizes access to data-driven insights by making sophisticated analytics capabilities available to all users, ranging from IT administrators and business analysts to data engineers and trained data scientists. The availability of Alteryx solutions in the cloud means users can gain access to insights even faster. We unify the analytics and analytic process into one simple self-service platform by combining tasks that were previously distributed among multiple tools and parties. Our platform allows a single user or group of users to easily and quickly discover, access, and prepare data from various sources, perform a variety of analyses, and deliver analytical output to drive data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes. This is done through a no-code, low-code approach, visual workflows, and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can reduce tedious, time-consuming manual tasks to a few mouse-clicks while eliminating the need to write complex software code. Our Alteryx Analytics Cloud platform delivers an enterprise grade platform, deploying our cloud-based products with the scalability, built-in governance, and security that organizations demand as a part of their digital transformation. The resulting opportunity is significant, as our platform can enable and upskill millions of underserved data workers to do their jobs more effectively.
Our platform has been adopted by organizations across a wide variety of industries and sizes. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 8,300 customers in more than 90 countries, including over 930 of the Global 2000 companies. Our customers include Anheuser Busch, LLC, AutoNation, Inc., Biogen Idec Inc., Chevron Corporation, Daikin Industries, Ltd., Delta Air Lines, Inc., General Mills, Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., L’Oréal USA, Inc., Netflix, Inc., Pfizer Inc., salesforce.com, inc., Société Générale S.A., Royal Bank of Canada, Unilever PLC, United Parcel Service, Inc., and Visa Inc.
We believe analytics automation is an area in which companies are continuing to invest and we are seeing continued success in the analytics automation market with our enterprise-focused sales motion. For many of our customers, analytics has become a priority at the executive level and we have experienced success in identifying and involving executive sponsors to champion analytics democratization initiatives within their organizations. This has led to an increase in the adoption of enterprise license agreements, which provides our customers additional flexibility and encourages exploration of new cases with new users throughout their organizations. Our focus on selling to the enterprise has enabled us to lead with the sale of our platform rather than the sale of individual products. 
We sell our platform primarily through direct and indirect sales and marketing channels. We have cultivated strong relationships with channel partners to help us extend the reach of our sales and marketing efforts internationally. Our channel partners include technology alliances, solution providers, global strategic integrators, value-added resellers, or VARs, and cloud service providers. These partners also provide solution-based selling, services, and training internationally.

Our Technology
Underpinning our platform is a set of technological innovations that make robust data analytics easy through an in-memory engine, sophisticated analytic models, and an open and modular core:
Engines
Our engines are optimized to process data within random-access memory and can utilize disk, when necessary, as temporary virtual memory. This facilitates significantly faster and more secure processing of data than traditional disk-based mechanisms while ensuring that the source data remains unaltered and is not duplicated. In addition to our high-speed in-memory processing capabilities, our cloud platform enables in-database processing to take advantage of using cloud computing resources for faster processing when working with large datasets in cloud data warehouses. Key features of our engines include:
•Connected. Business analysts can rapidly connect to data in existing formats and locations, reducing the need for time-consuming data transformation processes that typically require IT personnel.
•Non-persisted. Our engine leverages non-persisted data pipelines to enable users to process large amounts of data securely while applying complex logic every time they run an analytic workflow.
•Scaled out. While most workflows can be run on any single desktop or laptop or in-browser, when greater processing capability is required, workloads can be pushed to a server or cluster of servers, including Hadoop or Spark clusters, or pushdown processing can be used to process the workload where the data is stored.
Sophisticated Analytic Models
We enable business analysts, data scientists, and citizen data scientists to produce analytics ranging from descriptive and diagnostic to highly complex, including predictive, prescriptive, and spatial. Specifically, we enable predictive analytics through utilization of R, an open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, and Python, a popular programming language for analytics with many publicly available packages. Our capabilities allow transparency and editing of the R and Python code without requiring prior coding experience. In addition, in-database processing enables analysts to scale predictive analytics and harness the value of large sets of data without moving the data out of a database, improving predictive model development performance over traditional approaches. Deep geospatial tools, such as a drive time engine, create the basis for performing location-based analysis.
Open and Modular Core
Our platform is built with an open and modular core that enables additional functions and programming models to interact with it. For example, our platform utilizes Alteryx-managed open-source Python libraries, such as EvalML, Featuretools, Compose and Woodwork, enabling AutoML for advanced analytics in a simple guided user interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying code. For sophisticated business analysts, the underlying code is available for review and contribution in GitHub. The integration of our platform with Python takes advantage of advanced analytics technology and ensures seamless, fast operations. The Alteryx Platform Software Development Kit, or SDK, is also available in a similar capacity. The SDK provides customers and partners with open access to Python and JavaScript code and APIs that they can use to drive customizations to the platform.

We recognize that each unique characteristic of our employees makes us stronger, which is why we are committed to equitable hiring practices, ongoing self-evaluation, and providing education that empowers our employees. Where allowed by law, we monitor the diverse characteristics of our new hires and existing employees, including a focus on internal promotions and employee retention. Among other things, we have conducted periodic, anonymous employee engagement surveys and assessed attendance at events geared toward diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging topics to gauge receptivity to, and the effectiveness of, our efforts in these areas. To help our employees feel seen and supported, we have also supported multiple employee resource groups, safe places led by employees where members and their allies can connect based on shared characteristics, interests, or lived experiences. Additionally, we have conducted roundtable discussions and hosted listening circles to hear the voices of our employees and know which areas need our continued focus and commitment. In 2022, we also grew our Social Impact team to regionalize our efforts in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region and in the Asia-Pacific and Japan region.
Employee Development and Training
We believe that investing in our talent’s growth and development will directly enhance our overall company performance. Employees are encouraged to invest regularly in their own professional development and are provided opportunities to focus on longer term projects. We offer development opportunities through short-term mentoring programs, longer-term leadership development training, frequent live trainings provided by our Learning and Development team on topics such as giving and receiving feedback, change management, leading a hybrid workforce, creating a diverse and inclusive work environment, managing your career, and goal-setting, and on-demand training modules covering a variety of topics that are available at any time through our intranet. In addition, we offer our employees a tuition support program to promote ongoing learning and education at accredited programs and institutions.
Competitive Pay and Benefits 
We strive to provide pay, comprehensive benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our people. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, including equity compensation, flexible (unlimited) time off for U.S. employees, competitive paid time off for non-U.S. employees, family forming fertility and adoption benefits, and other comprehensive and competitive global benefits. For example, in the United States, we provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all new parents (either through birth or adoption). We have a particular focus on mental health and well-being, reinforced by providing access to a leading mindfulness and meditation application and annual company-wide mental health days. And, for all of our employees, we offer competitive financial benefits and programming focused on aiding our employees with their financial wellness and retirement planning. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with our stockholders, we offer equity compensation to employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs and the opportunity for eligible employees to participate in an employee stock purchase plan.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams work closely together to increase market awareness, drive demand for our platform, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth.
Sales
We sell our platform through our direct sales organization and indirect channel partners both internationally and domestically. Our business model involves an enterprise sales motion, as well as a “land and expand” sales motion. Our go-to-market approach often begins with a free trial of Alteryx Designer and is followed by an initial purchase of our offerings. As organizations quickly realize the benefits derived from our platform, use frequently spreads across departments, divisions, and geographies through word-of-mouth, collaboration, and standardization and automatization of business processes. Both for an initial purchase and as part of expanding a current customer’s use of our products, we also employ an enterprise-focused sales motion that identifies and involves members of a customer’s senior management team to accelerate acceptance and adoption of our platform within their organization. We offer customers a variety of purchasing options, such as enterprise license agreements, which provides our customers additional flexibility and encourages exploration of new use cases with new users throughout their organizations. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is strategic and collaborative in nature and it becomes a fundamental element of their operational, analytical and business processes.
Our sales organization is comprised of sales teams oriented toward defined market segments. A sales team typically comprises an account executive, sales engineer and supporting resources from our partners, renewals, inside sales, business development, and customer success teams. Our customer success and support organizations are responsible for post-sales training and support, and maintaining customer relationships, which supports renewals of existing contracts.
We continue to invest in expanding our business with partners of all types globally. This will enable us to expand our geographic reach, extend to new buying centers within our customers, and integrate well with other companies in the data ecosystem. We believe the combination of our partner-centric strategy and updated partner program announced in March 2022 will continue to drive growth in business influenced by technology partners.
Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for increasing awareness of, and generating demand for, our platform, creating high-quality leads for our sales force through a mix of volume demand generation and account-based marketing, and fostering our community of users. A central focus of our marketing efforts is to drive awareness of our platform and increase website traffic, engagement, and sales lead conversions. These initiatives are intended to increase downloads of free trials of our platform and encourage use of our free online training, which are integral parts of our customer acquisition process. We utilize a wide range of marketing initiatives, including our website, social media, an interactive product tour, paid search, sponsorships, e-mail, webinars, partner events, and field events often with analytic leaders and data scientists. In 2022, our marketing organization launched a new initiative to engage digital “influencers,” experts in the analytics space with large and highly active audiences across social media and other digital media channels. This strategy is designed to expand brand awareness and reach into the digital-native audience where current and potential customers are engaging. Our annual user conferences play a key role in providing current and prospective customers with a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers, training, and highlighting customer use cases and best practices.
Strategic Partnerships
We have cultivated strong relationships with channel partners to help us extend the reach of our sales and marketing efforts. Our partnerships are primarily with global strategic integrators, solution providers, which include VARs, independent software vendors, and a growing network of OEMs. In March 2022, we announced an updated partner program that includes incentives for joint customer success, technical expertise, and new customer acquisition, and rewards partners with benefits across tiered levels of participation.
Global Strategic Integrators
Our global system integrators include strategic and advisory firms that help drive business activity. Further to our strategic growth initiative to grow global partnerships, the Alteryx Europe, Middle East, and Africa region established new partnerships with PwC Ireland and KPMG UK. 
Strategic Consulting Organizations
In November 2022, Alteryx entered into an alliance with EY to help clients across various sectors leverage our platform along with EY’s digital transformation capabilities. Through the EY-Alteryx Alliance, clients gain access to, and counsel from, technology and consulting subject matter experts for data exploration, transformation and analysis.
Solution Providers
Our solution providers consist of system integrators, management consulting firms, VARs, and cloud service providers. Solution providers bring product expertise and implementation services and best practices to our customers globally. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 500 solution providers and VARs that create scale for our platform through their network of trained consultants, on-point analytic services, and deep domain expertise. They provide vertical expertise and technical advice while solving complex business challenges and generating repeatable analytic workflows and applications in addition to reselling or bundling our software. Our reseller program is designed to scale growth, help generate new opportunities, optimize customer experience and care, increase profitability, and increase sales efficiency.
Independent Software Vendors
Independent software vendors consist of cloud and data platforms and solutions and augmented technology offerings that enhance and extend our platform and solutions. We have optimized integrations and solutions for a variety of independent software vendor solutions, data platforms, and software-as-a-service, or SaaS, offerings, including Microsoft Azure Services, Amazon Web Services, Inc., Snowflake Inc., leading robotic process automation, or RPA, solutions, solutions offered by Google, LLC, International Business Machines Corporation, Oracle Corporation, salesforce.com, inc., UiPath, Blue Prism, and SAP SE, and machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We natively support output to most visual formats such as those offered by Microsoft Corporation, Qlik Technologies, Inc., and Tableau Software, LLC, a Salesforce company. 
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets, and supporting existing customer deployments. Our research and development team, which consisted of 736 employees as of December 31, 2022, was located primarily in California, Colorado, and Massachusetts in the United States as well as Australia, India, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine, and comprises dedicated research employees, software engineers, quality assurance engineers, user experience experts, site and site operations engineers, and product managers. We leverage agile development methodologies and work with the latest technologies, resulting in a dynamic, state of the art, automated software development process that has allowed us to deliver high-quality products and services and adapt to market changes and new requirements quickly.
Seasonality
Due to the budgeting cycles of our current and potential customers, historically, we enter into more agreements with new customers and more renewed agreements with existing customers in the fourth quarter of each calendar year than in any other quarter. The impact of seasonality is heightened on subscriptions that are multi-year in nature with more revenue recognized at a point in time when the platform is first made available to the customers, or the beginning of the subscription term, if later, and the remaining portion recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Our rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. Seasonality in our business can also be impacted by introductions of new or enhanced products and services, including the costs associated with such introductions, or wider macroeconomic effects.
Competition
The market for self-service data analytics solutions is new and rapidly evolving. In many cases, our primary competitors are manual, spreadsheet-driven processes and custom-built approaches in which potential customers have made significant investments. In addition, we compete with large software companies, including providers of traditional business intelligence tools that offer one or more capabilities that are competitive with our platform. These capabilities include data preparation and/or advanced analytic modeling tools from Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAS Institute Inc., and Amazon Web Services, Inc. Additionally, data visualization companies which already offer products and services in adjacent markets have recently introduced products and services that may become competitive with our offerings in the future. 
We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom might be our current technology partners. In addition, some business analytics software companies offer data preparation options that are competitive with some of the features within our platform, such as Databricks, Inc., Dataiku Ltd., DataRobot, Inc., salesforce.com, inc., TIBCO Software Inc., and Qlik International AB.
Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services, or other resources and greater name recognition than us. We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the self-service data analytics software market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and services and technologies are introduced.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of use;
•platform features, quality, functionality, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;
•ability to automate analytical tasks or processes;
•ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•software analytics expertise;
•total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•customer experience, including customer success, professional services, and support.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and quality of our platform.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other parties.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, security and protection, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities, and tax. In addition, we may currently or in the future be subject to various laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts with our customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, which may affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Additional laws and regulations relating to these areas will likely be passed in the future, and these or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted or enforced in new or expanded manners, each of which could result in significant limitations on the way we operate our business. 
New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, products, services, or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional products and services, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements and costs may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. We believe we are currently in material compliance with laws and regulations to which we are subject and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. 
For additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations, see the section titled “Risk Factors--We are required to comply with export control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.”
