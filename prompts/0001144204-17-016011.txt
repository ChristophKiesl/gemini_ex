Overview
 
We are a digital health (mHealth) company that is developing and commercializing a patented and proprietary technology providing consumers with laboratory-testing capabilities using smart phones and other mobile devices. Our principal operating subsidiary, LabStyle Innovation Ltd., is an Israeli company with its headquarters in Caesarea, Israel. We were formed on August 11, 2011 as a Delaware corporation with the name LabStyle Innovations Corp. On July 28, 2016, we changed our name to DarioHealth Corp. Our flagship product, Dario™, which we also refer to as our Dario™ Smart Diabetes Management Solution is a mobile, real-time, cloud-based, diabetes management solution based on an innovative, multi-feature software application combined with a stylish, ‘all-in-one’, pocket-sized, blood glucose monitoring device, which we call the Dario™ Smart Meter.
 
The Dario™ Smart Diabetes Management Solution is targeted at the mHealth app market currently estimated at $10 billion globally with expected annual growth of 15% to $31 billion by 2020 according to Research2Guidance. In addition, we are also focusing on the global diabetes care devices market for diabetic blood glucose self-monitoring, known as BGMS, that is expected to reach approximately $24.6 billion by 2020 according to researchandmarkets.com. Diabetes is a disease where insufficient levels, or a total absence, of the hormone insulin produces high levels of glucose in the bloodstream, which can lead to long term adverse effects on a patient’s blood vessels, which in turn can lead to heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease and nerve damage. As part of controlling blood sugar, many patients must self-monitor their blood glucose levels using home testing kits (called glucose meters) and treat high and low blood sugar episodes accordingly to avoid the complications from the disease. We believe that by allowing patients to properly monitor the disease, provide actionable insights in real-time and create an online link to healthcare providers, this will ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs - both critical advantages for the diabetes industry.
 
Dario™ is a comprehensive, digital diabetes management solution utilizing our patented and proprietary technology delivered through a cutting edge software application (commonly known as an “app”) available for iPhone or Android and cloud-based data services with a novel BGMS device (the Dario™ Smart Meter) that connect via a device’s audio jack consisting of a lancet (to obtain a blood sample), a device-specific disposable test strip cartridge and a smart mobile device-driven glucose reader adaptor. Roughly the size of a pack of gum, we believe that the Dario™ Smart Meter has the potential to replace standalone glucose meters and their kits (lancing, lancets and strips vials) which are the current market standard, most of which have the necessary testing components separated from one another in what we believe is a cumbersome design. Moreover, all but a few glucose meters lack an interface with a smart mobile device, and none presently have the software features associated with Dario™, each of which we believe will distinguish Dario™ as an alternative in the marketplace.
 
Beyond the benefits of individual diabetes management, we envision the Dario™ application becoming the centerpiece in a new era of interconnected devices and services, providing healthier and better lives for diabetic patients worldwide. With every single measurement captured and stored on a secure cloud data base, DarioHealth’s software driven, comprehensive data-management technology has the potential to deliver actionable insight and analytical tools to manage individual patients or large populations, as well as provide a complete and comprehensive “big data” solution for healthcare providers and payers.
 
Beyond blood glucose testing, DarioHealth’s technology provides a body-fluid testing apparatus for performing metered measurement of samples utilizing: (i) a lancing device to obtain a test sample (blood in the case of Dario™); and (ii) an adaptor specifically designed to connect a strip devised to absorb the sample, which then produces an electric signal indicating the level of the substance tested for in the sample.  The adaptor is then connected to a smart mobile device via the headphone jack, which allows the test signal to be transmitted to the smart mobile device, which will then utilize our software application to obtain and display the test result on the device.  This is coupled with a set of software features available via a smart mobile device application as well as cloud-based services, in real-time.  We are presently pursuing patent applications in multiple jurisdictions covering the specific processes related to blood glucose level measurement as well as more general methods of rapid tests of body fluids using mobile devices and cloud-based services. On August 5, 2014, we were issued a U.S. patent (No. 8,797,180) relating to how the Dario™ blood glucose monitor draws power from and transmits data to a smart phone via the audio jack port and on September 8, 2015, we were issued a U.S. patent (No. 9,125,549) that broadens our registered patent No. 8,797,180 to include testing of other bodily fluids through an audio jack connection. We believe these represent critical intellectual property recognition and a significant initial validation of our intellectual property efforts.

On September 23, 2013, we announced our receipt of CE Mark certification to market Dario™. The receipt of the CE Mark (which incorporated positive data from clinical user performance studies undertaken in Israel) allows Dario™ to be marketed and sold in 32 countries across Europe as well as in certain other countries worldwide. On March 5, 2014, the Medical Device Safety Service, or MDSS, our European Authorized Representative, completed the registration of the Dario™ Smart Meter with the German Authority as required by Article 10 of Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.
 
On December 22, 2015, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 510(k) clearance for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System, including its components, the Dario Blood Glucose Meter, Dario Blood Glucose Test Strips, Dario Glucose Control Solutions and the Dario app on the Apple iOS 6.1 platform and higher. The receipt of FDA clearance allows Dario™ to be marketed and sold in the United States and was a significant milestone towards marketing and commercialization of Dario in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. 
 
In June 2014, we were granted (effective September 1, 2014) reimbursement status in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for strips and lancets to be utilized together with the Dario™ Smart Meter. We are actively pursuing reimbursement coverage in other jurisdictions.
 
In July 2014, we received approval from Israel’s Ministry of Health to sell the Dario™ Smart Meter for diabetes in Israel and also released the Dario™ Diabetes Management App for Android smartphone users. The Android mobile application has the same user interface and features as the iOS Dario™.
 
In December 2014, we received Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, certification to market the Dario™ in Australia. We were also granted reimbursement status for the Dario™ test strips in Australia by the NDSS.
 
In December 2014, we entered into an agreement with Israel’s leading Health Maintenance Organization (healthcare HMO), Maccabi Healthcare, or MOMA, to implement a comprehensive Dario™ digital suite for patients and professionals. The agreement with MOMA (Maccabi TeleCare unit) represents an additional revenue stream channel for Dario™. We believe this revenue channel demonstrates the significant potential available in software-based services and value added services with HMOs and other strategic partners worldwide. The Dario™ application for MOMA is a proprietary customized diabetes management solution that enables remote treatment for diabetes and aims to improve overall outcomes for patients leveraging mHealth technology for effective engagement of health care professionals.
 
In February 2015, we obtained National Pharmaceutical Product Interface (known as NAPPI) approval and have registered Dario™ for sale in South Africa.
 
In March 2015, we started marketing the Dario™ Smart Diabetes Management Solution in the Netherlands and New Zealand as a private, out of pocket offering (no reimbursement).
 
In May 2015, we received Health Canada approval to market and sell Dario™ in Canada and we commenced sales in Canada in June 2015. The majority of Canadian medical plans are currently providing reimbursement coverage for Dario™.
 
The Dario™ Smart Diabetes Management Solution has fully launched and begun penetrating the above mentioned markets with additional launch and market penetration plans for Germany and India. In 2017, we plan to consistently add additional features and functionality in order to make Dario™ Smart Diabetes Management Solution the new standard of care in diabetes data management. For example, we have recently completed the development of a version of the Dario™ Smart Meter that connects to an iPhone 7 through the lightning jack instead of the missing audio jack. We plan to start marketing our new meter product in the coming months after completing the clearance process with the relevant regulatory authorities like the FDA and obtaining a CE mark.

We commenced a commercial launch of the free DarioTM application in the United Kingdom in late 2013 and commenced an initial soft launch of the full DarioTM solution (including the app and the Smart Meter) in selected jurisdictions in March 2014 with the goal of collecting customer feedback to refine our longer-term roll-out strategy and continued to scale up launch during 2014 in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and New Zealand, in 2015 in Australia, Israel and Canada and in 2016 in the United States. We are consistently adding additional features and functionality in making DarioTM Smart Diabetes Management Solution the new standard of care in diabetes data management.
 
In the United States we commenced commercialization in March 2016 and intend to continue to generate demand through a digital direct to consumer marketing campaign. Customers are currently able to purchase the product directly through our proprietary e-store where they can also subscribe to a subscription-based service. In July 2016, we signed an agreement with GEMCO Medical, an established healthcare distributor and a pioneer in the diabetes supply industry, to become the first authorized United States distributor of DarioTM and to complement the Company's direct-to-consumer model to further expand and strengthen its presence in the United States. Also during July 2016, we launched our Australian proprietary e-store where customers may subscribe to a subscription-based service. Additional third party distribution channels are expected to be established through 2017, although there is no guarantee we will be successful. We also intend to continue to broaden our reach via distribution agreements with national and regional durable medical equipment and pharmacy chains.
 
In Europe, we plan to start our direct to consumer marketing efforts in 2017.
 
Although we are initially targeting only the large and growing BGMS market, we believe our invention has the potential to cover dozens of laboratory tests of bodily fluids (including blood, urine and saliva) that could potentially be undertaken using a smart mobile device, including blood coagulation, cholesterol, HIV and others.
 
Our Initial Product - Dario™
 
We believe that the diabetic disease management market presents the most attractive initial application for our proprietary technology as there are millions of potential diabetic users of a smart mobile device-enabled glucose monitoring technology.  As such, our first product, which we also refer to as the Dario™ Smart Diabetes Management Solution, will seek to revolutionize the way diabetic patients around the world manage their disease and connect with healthcare providers and others, making the Dario™ solution user-centric, engaging and accessible to all.
 
The full Dario™ diabetes management solution consists of a robust, real-time, cloud-based software application combined with the Dario™ Smart Meter.  Roughly the size of a pack of gum, the Dario™ Smart Meter is an all-in-one device that includes the glucose reader which is connected to a smart mobile device via the device audio jack, along with a lancing device (a reusable blood-sampling device, when loaded with a disposable lancet) and an integrated, disposable cartridge for test strips. Beyond the benefits of individual diabetes management, we envision the Dario™ application becoming the centerpiece in a new era of interconnected devices and services, providing healthier and better lives for diabetic patients worldwide. With every single measurement captured and stored on a secure cloud data base, DarioHealth’s software driven, comprehensive data-management technology has the potential to deliver actionable insight and analytical tools to manage individual patients or large populations, as well as provide a complete and comprehensive “big data” solution for healthcare providers and payers.
 
Our revenues are derived from sales of Dario™’s components, including the Smart Meter itself, and principally from the recurring sale of our disposable cartridges with 25 test strips and other consumables.  Our customers receive access to our smart mobile device application, which incorporate tools to help diabetic patients manage their disease.  Importantly, our revenue model is driven by the fact that only our test strips, purchased through us and our partners, are able to be utilized with the Dario™ Smart Meter and software, so it is our expectation that we will be the sole source for Dario™ compatible test strips. In addition to Smart Meter and test strip related revenue, we anticipate to generate revenues in the future from our ability to offer Dario™’s subscribers additional products and services based on personalized recommendations, such as location-based, low-sugar food recommendations and the ability to send alerts to caregivers and family and friends.  It is our intention to generate and sustain revenue not only from the consumables but also from software licensing and added value services so that the data monetization revenue channel becomes a significant contributor to the company’s gross margin. We plan to monetize the comprehensive data that is collected in the Dario™ cloud as a result of various offerings such as a platform for diabetes related clinical trials.

We believe the following features of our Dario™ solution and the manner in which we plan to market and distribute the product will help position Dario™ to gain users and drive revenue growth:
 

● | Look and Feel. While utilizing the same state of the art electro-chemical, blood-based measurement techniques as standard glucose monitors offers familiar usability, the Dario™ blood glucose monitor is easily integrated with the patient’s own smart mobile device that offers a distinctive look and feel. Furthermore, unlike the market standards, the Dario™ Smart Meter has an integrated lancing device and disposable strip cartridge. This eliminates the need for a separate glucose monitor, lancing device and strip vial and, we believe, will make Dario™ the Smart Meter among the smallest footprint in the market. Furthermore, Dario™ has novel applications incorporating software tools to help diabetic patients manage their disease. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large Market of Potential Users. Our reliance on diabetics within the massive smart mobile device market gives us an established potential user-base. The most recent publicly available reports from Nielsen indicate that in the U.S., smartphone usage continues to climb. More than three out of five (61%) mobile subscribers in the U.S. owned a smartphone during the most recent three-month period for which data is available (March-May 2013), up more than 10% since smartphones became the mobile majority in early 2012. In March 2012, 50% of mobile subscribers used smartphones, making up the majority for the first time. Moreover, according to a Research2Guidance report from 2014, the percentage of people with diabetes who own a smartphone and will utilize apps to manage their condition is 1.2% or approximately 3.7 million people in 2014, growing to an anticipated 7.8%, or approximately 24 million people, by 2018, which would represent an increase of 650%. In many countries (including the U.S.), smart mobile devices are also typically subsidized by the cellular providers through discounted pricing associated with related plan subscriptions, enabling Dario™ to benefit from the extensive marketing by cellular companies of these devices. We believe that it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of smart mobile device users with diabetes mirrors that of the general population. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Marketing and Distribution. In the U.S. and Australia we have our own direct to consumer marketing channel to support our sales efforts. In the U.S. we also plan to contract with nonexclusive distributors and partners. In Europe, New Zealand and Canada, we use distribution partners to market and sell Dario™. In Israel, we have developed a direct sales and marketing channel through e-commerce. Our direct to consumer marketing channel supports our distributors’ efforts in Canada, and we are planning to expand such efforts to the U.K. during 2017. This approach enables a direct communication channel with the market and the diabetic community. This approach is also designed to effectively create brand awareness with a significantly reduced use of our capital resources versus the amounts required via the traditional, offline retail channels. In some additional jurisdictions, we may adopt a direct sales model in addition to utilizing local distributors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “Expanding the Pie”. Our goal is to obtain significant market share using technological innovations and by expanding the total BGMS market size “pie” through offering a user-friendly diabetes management solution that utilizes an existing platform and installed potential user base (smart mobile devices and smart mobile device users, respectively). We will endeavor to emphasize the user friendly nature of Dario™ to expand the total BGMS market size by encouraging existing diabetes patients to test their glucose levels more frequently and by encouraging the “non-testing” population to adopt glucose monitoring. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitive Cost of Goods Sold. Based on our market research and discussions with our test strip manufacturer, we believe that our anticipated outsourced manufacturing cost of the test strips will be similar to our estimate of our competitors’ cost for existing single-use disposable strips. In addition, we believe the manufacturing costs of our Dario™ Smart Meter will be competitive with those of the leading glucose meters. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Opportunities for Commercialization Partnerships. Healthcare and pharmaceutical company entrants into the BGMS market (such as Perigo and Sanofi) are licensing and/or acquiring technologies, seeking differentiation, thereby providing us with opportunities for more rapid commercialization through partnerships. Therefore, we plan to explore the possibility of entering into commercialization agreements, including an upfront payment, supply agreement and royalty payments, with strategic partners. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently there are a few new market entrants in the BGMS space that are attempting to utilize computer or smart mobile device connectivity, including Medisana GlucoDock, One Drop and iHealth Align.  We believe that none of these devices offer the integration of an all-in-one unit that includes a lancing device and strip cartridge as Dario™ does. We further believe that these competitors provide limited capabilities over their diabetes management apps as compared to the Dario™ application.
 
As a result, we believe Dario™ will bring an entirely new dynamic to the BGMS device market.  We believe that our primary business model for Dario™ is clean and simple - sales of proprietary glucose test strips (the disposable component) directly to consumers, leveraging an installed base of mobile phones. The entire mechanism consists of a small and simple adaptor combined with a strip which is connected to the smart mobile device’s headphone jack, with the strip test results being read by the smart mobile device.
 
We also believe that this business model is the foundation for a broader push to improve the health care system. An application that is always in your pocket and used multiple times per day is an ideal platform to support people living with diabetes, their health care providers, and health systems. Our application is designed to improve health outcomes and reduce costs through increased insights, motivating tools and automation.
 
Background on Diabetes
 
Diabetes is a chronic disease that arises when the pancreas does not produce enough (or ceases to produce) insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.  Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that enables cells to take in glucose from the blood and use it for energy.  Failure to produce insulin, or of insulin to act properly, or both, leads to raised glucose (sugar) levels in the blood (hyperglycemia), which can be detected with a blood test.  Excess glucose in the blood has been shown to cause damage to blood vessels and is thus associated with long-term damage to the body and failure of various organs and tissues, including the retina and the kidneys. There are three main types of diabetes:
 
Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called insulin-dependent, or juvenile, diabetes, is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the body’s defense system attacks the insulin-producing cells located in a person’s pancreas.  The reason why this occurs is not fully understood.  People with Type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin.  The disease can affect people of any age, but usually occurs in children or young adults.  People with this form of diabetes need injections or infusions of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood.  Type 1 diabetes patients constitute approximately 10% of the overall number of patients, but are much more extensive users of BGMS, as these diabetics need to measure their glucose levels 4-10 times day (versus once or twice a day for most Type 2 diabetic patients).  The vast majority of Type 1 diabetes patients are insulin dependent.
 
Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called adult-onset diabetes and accounts for at least 90% of all cases of diabetes.  It is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, either of which may be present at the time that diabetes becomes clinically manifest. The diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes usually occurs after the age of 40 but can occur earlier, especially in populations with high diabetes incidence.  Type 2 diabetes can remain undetected for many years and the diagnosis is often made from associated complications or incidentally through an abnormal blood or urine glucose test.  It is often, but not always, associated with obesity, which may contribute to insulin resistance and lead to elevated blood glucose levels.  A growing portion of the Type 2 diabetes patients are insulin dependent or use insulin as part of their treatment.
 
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of diabetes consisting of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy.  It develops in one in 25 pregnancies worldwide and is associated with complications in the time period immediately before and after birth.  GDM usually disappears after pregnancy but women with GDM and their offspring are at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.  Approximately half of women with a history of GDM go on to develop Type 2 diabetes within five to ten years after delivery.

We also believe we will be able to support patients with pre-diabetes, also called metabolic syndrome.  Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  According to the National Institutes of Health, during the years 2009-2012, 37% of U.S. adults ages 20 years or older had pre-diabetes, with 51% of those ages 65 years or older, leading the NIH to estimate that approximately 86 million persons in the U.S. had pre-diabetes in 2012.  This population is typically prescribed with periodic lab-based glucose level testing (which requires a doctor visit, significantly reducing the compliance level) and typically does not involve the utilization of self-monitoring glucose devices.
 
The Diabetic and BGMS Markets and the Dario™ Solution 
 
Diabetes is a growing epidemic for which no cure exists, but for which treatments (including a regimen of frequent blood glucose testing) are available.  The medical journal Lancet has reported that number of worldwide diabetics has doubled over the past thirty years.  While about 70% of the increase has been attributed in the Lancet report to population growth and aging, the balance was linked to changing diets, rising obesity levels and less physical activity.
 
According to the International Diabetes Foundation (IDF), approximately 415 million people worldwide were estimated to have diabetes in 2015, or one in eleven adults. The greatest number are between 40 and 59 years old. If these trends continue, by 2040, some 642 million people. According to the IDF, in Europe, there were 59.8 million adults over the age of 20 with diabetes in 2015and approximately 29.2 million adults over the age of 20 with diabetes in the U.S. in 2015.  In the U.S., one in four adults have diabetes.  An additional 86 million U.S. adults had pre-diabetes in 2012, which puts them at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes according to the ADA.  Approximately 179 million adults with diabetes live in China and India, with approximately 14.2 million in Brazil and 12 million in Russia.
 
It is estimated that the costs of diabetes complications account for between 5% and 10% of total healthcare spending in the world. In the United States, the ADA estimates that the total cost of diagnosed diabetes has risen from $174 billion in 2007 to $245 billion in 2012. Early diagnosis of warning signs and ongoing monitoring of diabetes are the keys to the prevention and treatment of the disease, with blood glucose monitoring being the primary method of diagnosis and disease management, coupled with matching blood glucose readings with food (i.e., carbohydrate) and insulin or other medication intake.
 
Since blood glucose self-monitoring is a key part of managing diabetes, the market for BGMS products required to service these many patients is also large.  As reported in a press release published by Transparency Market Research, the blood glucose self-monitoring market is currently estimated to be $12 billion and is expected to grow to an estimated $27 billion by 2022.  The same source also notes that the total diabetes management market was $50.8 billion in 2011 and is estimated to reach $98.4 billion by 2018.  The biggest drivers for growth in the diabetes device market will be the increased prevalence and awareness of diabetes.  The U.S. is the largest market, contributing close to 40% of the global market for these devices.  In fact, the BGMS testing market, which barely existed in 1980, now accounts for approximately a quarter of the entire in vitro diagnostics industry.
 
Key factors driving market growth include increasing number of people with diabetes, growing patient awareness, technological advancements and increasing number of patients adopting blood glucose self-monitoring.  In addition, the affordable cost of blood glucose test strips, and increase in daily monitoring, are also expected to contribute to market growth.  As such, BGMS represents a large market that has grown significantly over the past 30 years and is expected to continue to grow.
 
It is important to note that the diabetic market is a first point of entry for Dario and the goal of providing mHealth/Digital health solutions for a variety of chronic and wellness related conditions based on mobile device testing will grant us access to a much larger market. The DarioTM Smart Diabetes Management Solution is targeted at the mHealth app market currently estimated at $10 billion globally with expected annual growth of 15% to $31 billion by 2020.

Industry Background and the Dario™ Opportunity
 
From a competition perspective, four companies currently dominate the BGMS business, controlling more than 90% of the market: Roche Diagnostics (part of Hoffman-LaRoche), LifeScan (a Johnson & Johnson company), Bayer Healthcare Division, and Abbott Laboratories.  These “big four” offer a wide variety of BGMS products and have led the market since the late 1990s.  Numerous second-tier and third-tier competitors, including several in Asia, hold the remaining 10% of the market.  We believe that the BGMS offerings by all vendors are comparable, with mild differentiation of the main feature sets of the devices.  This is akin to the differentiation among personal computers (PCs) during the 1990s and 2000s, where most of them had the same key feature set of Microsoft Windows and Intel Processors.
 
We believe that the increasing global adoption of mobile phones has created an opportunity for disruption in BGMS market. The Dario™ solution, which features a compact all-in-one Smart Meter coupled with iOS, Android and web-based apps, is intended to eliminate the need for separate glucose monitors, carb-calculators and cumbersome dependency on wired, computer-based logging tools.  Our intention is for Dario™ to not only deliver the best blood glucose monitoring experience, but also use the unique capabilities of mobile smart mobile devices to deliver better health outcomes.
 
With respect to the U.S. BGMS market, the principal barriers to entry (all of which we believe the features of Dario™ can overcome) can be summarized as follows:
 

● | Achieving significant product differentiation in the eyes of diabetes patients or insurance payers. We believe that Dario™ offers a novel design that is compatible with the usability of the current devices, yet offers a modern look and feel when compared to products in the marketplace. Marketing of the product directly to consumers will emphasize the product’s distinguishing attributes, without incurring the significant product introduction expenses typically incurred for the marketing of a standard glucose meter via traditional retail channels. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Costs. We anticipate that low manufacturing costs for the Dario™ dongle (the part of the Smart Meter that attaches to the phone jack) and the similarity to our competitors’ estimated cost of manufacturing the strips, when coupled with the direct-to-consumer marketing, creates the potential for providing us with a meaningful cost advantage versus most vendors of traditional glucose meters. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Difficulty obtaining shelf space at the pharmacy. With many products on the market, a new entrant has to battle for visibility on the shelf. Dario™ will limit this obstacle by emphasizing Internet based direct-to-consumer marketing and sales. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The challenge of influencing diabetes specialists to recommend another BGMS product to patients. We will seek to introduce and present Dario™ to the medical community through our participation in academic and professional conferences. Dario™ will mainly be marketed directly to our target users, who we believe are increasingly becoming the primary decision makers in choosing their glucose monitoring equipment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that Dario™’s specific features and trends in the marketplace create a significant opportunity to penetrate the market and effectively compete with and gain market share against the established players.
 
Utilization of Mobile Health Applications
 
Smart mobile device applications combine easy-to-use interfaces with continuous Internet access to create transformational mobile health solutions (often called mHealth).  Although the potential benefits of mHealth solutions have been widely discussed for over a decade, the market is now starting to emerge from the trial phase.  According to a publicly available 2016 study by Research2Guidance, smart mobile device applications will enable the mHealth industry to reach 551 million active users (at least once a month) by 2020. According to this report, in 2016, mHealth companies are estimated to generate $12.5 billion through mHealth apps related services mainly through service revenue, device revenue, consumable revenue, paid download revenue and advertising revenue. We believe that Dario™ is designed to play directly into this trend.

--

 

Currently more than 70% of the mHealth applications in major “app stores” are adhering to the paid business model according to Research2Guidance. With more and more traditional healthcare providers joining the mobile applications market, we expect the business models will broaden to include healthcare services, advertising and drug sales revenues.  According to Research2Guidance, with the growing sophistication level of mHealth applications, only 14% of the total market revenue in the next 5 years will come from application download, advertisement and transaction revenue, whereas 76% of total mHealth application market revenue will come from related services and products.  We believe that Dario™ is well-positioned to benefit from that trend.
 
The Dario™ diabetes management solution includes the Dario™ Smart Meter and software application for people with diabetes. Dario™ currently allows users to easily record, analyze, transmit and store key data points such as glucose level, insulin and carbohydrate intake. Moreover, the Dario™ application provides knowledge and motivation with an aim of improving health outcomes. In addition, we are developing software for health care providers and payers to help better support patients and intelligently manage large patient populations.
  
Sales and Marketing
 
Our initial marketing has been focused on the early adopter diabetics, and we expect to gradually broaden our marketing efforts (and benefitting from viral marketing) toward the entire diabetic population. We plan to initially focus on insulin dependent diabetic patients. While this population constitutes about 20-30% of the diabetic patient population, we estimate it to be responsible for over 60% of the revenue from blood glucose monitoring.  Dario™’s ease of use and the lack of need for a special glucometer are also expected to be of major appeal to the entire Type 2 diabetes population.
 
In Australia, we revised our sales and marketing strategy during the third quarter of 2016, and moved to a hybrid direct to consumer model in combination with on the ground out sourced Channel Sales Organization staff focused on the pharmacies. This model will allow us to accelerate our penetration into this market, while building a diabetes community via direct engagement.
 
In the U.K., DarioTM is a fully reimbursed product distributed by a new distributor since the second quarter of 2016. Dario is now available via all main pharmacies in the U.K.. Our sales and marketing efforts have been focused on wholesalers, pharmacies, HCP’s (Health Care Professionals), diabetes educators and hospitals via the distributor. This has created awareness and understanding of the value proposition DarioHealth offers to people with diabetes. In addition, DarioHealth will be focusing on increasing its presence in the U.K. market via its direct to consumer strategy, utilizing the country wide availability of the strips in pharmacy and clinical awareness of the product via the healthcare providers.
 
In Canada, Dario is available through major pharmacy chains across Canada that include brands like Safeway and London Drugs. DarioHealth also offers consumers the ability to buy direct via our online platform or to get their prescriptions serviced online via Bayshore. Similar to the U.K., in Canada we work on both promoting and marketing DarioTM to the medical establishment via our distributor and expanding its awareness via our direct to consumer strategy which we have been ramping up.
 
Through our experience in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and additional markets, we are poised to open up additional markets in 2017 that have a high diabetes penetration rate and fit our hybrid business model.
 
Dario™ is an Internet-driven product. Dario™ was designed for the mobile age and will be powered by the Internet as an effective route of launching and marketing new consumer products.  We currently sell directly to consumers and also collaborate with distributorsin various jurisdictions. It is estimated that a typical Type 1 diabetes patient, who is testing his or her blood sugar 4 to 10 times a day, uses 120 to 300 strips each month, which creates the potential for a substantial and predictable revenue stream.

On the marketing side, primarily utilize online marketing in order to create awareness of Dario™. Rather than solely rely on online advertisement, we will also consider revenue sharing with affiliate networks and a variety of other pay-for-performance methods commonly used in online commerce.
 
In December 2014, we entered into an agreement with Israel's leading healthcare HMO, Maccabi Healthcare, to implement a comprehensive Dario™ digital suite for patients and professionals. The agreement with MOMA (Maccabi TeleCare unit) represents an additional channel of revenue stream for Dario™. We believe this channel for revenues indicates the huge potential available which is based on software licensing and added value services with HMOs and other strategic partners worldwide. The Dario™ application for MOMA is a proprietary customized diabetes management solution that enables remote treatment for diabetes which aims to improve overall outcomes for patients leveraging mHealth technology for effective engagement of health care professionals.
 
We also expect to collaborate with the medical community to showcase what we expect will be Dario™’s clinical equivalence and usability superiority.
 
Manufacturing
 
As we do not engage in manufacturing activity ourselves, we have supply agreements with manufacturers for the Dario™ Smart Meter, glucose test strips, lancing devices and lancets.  We have arrangements in place with commercial scale manufacturers for both the Dario™ Smart Meters and for our test strips. As a result of investments we have made over the past several years, we own the specialized equipment used to manufacture Dario™ Smart Meters.
 
During 2015, we commenced manufacturing of our Dario™ Smart Meter with a Chinese manufacturer as part of our efforts to further reduce manufacturing costs of the Dario™ Smart Meter. In the beginning of 2016 we have transitioned our manufacturing to a new Chinese manufacturer as part of our effort to increase our manufacturing capacity and improve cost savings.
 
Insurance Reimbursement
 
In the United States and in other jurisdictions such as Germany and England, we expect that Dario™’s test strips should generally be available for full or partial patient reimbursement by third-party payers.  We expect to work with third-party payers in the countries into which we expect to market Dario™ in order to establish coverage for test strips, although we cannot be sure of this being obtained.  In April 2014, we announced the receipt of reimbursement coverage for the use of the Dario™ Smart Meter in Italy, making 600,000 Italians eligible for reimbursement coverage. In June 2014, we were granted (effective September 1, 2014) reimbursement status in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for strips and lancets to be utilized together with the Dario™ Smart Meter. In December 2014, we were granted reimbursement status for the Dario™ test strips Australia. In May 2015 we launched Dario™ in Canada and the majority of Canadian medical plans are now covering Dario™ test strips with reimbursement. We expect the balance of Canadian insurance plans to provide reimbursement coverage in the near future. We are planning to pursue reimbursement coverage in other jurisdictions.
Clinical Trials
 
As part of our CE Mark clearance, in 2013 we conducted positive User Performance studies for the Dario™ Smart Meter in Israel with 161 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to collect measurement data from capillary blood with defined distribution of glucose concentrations in order to perform system accuracy evaluation according to ISO 15197:2013, the current international standard requirements for BGMS systems. The results of this study showed that the Dario™ strips are well within the limits for system accuracy defined by ISO 15197:2013 in that 100% of results fell within zones A and B of the Consensus Error Grid for all systems, which means that the system accuracy requirements of the ISO 15197:2013 have been met. The acceptance criteria for accuracy of BGMS per ISO 15197:2013 is “95 % of the individual glucose measured values shall fall within ± 0,83 mmol/l (±15 mg/dl) of the measured values of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at glucose concentrations < 5,55 mmol/l (<100 mg/dl) and within ± 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5,55 mmol/l (≥100 mg/dl)”.

In January 2015, we completed, and in March 2015, we announced positive results from, a required User Performance evaluation study in the U.S. to evaluate the accuracy of blood glucose level results obtained from fingertip using Dario™ compared to reference equipment (YSI 2300 STATPLUS) and to evaluate the ease of use of the Dario™ device by the first time user.  This study was in connection with our regulatory submissions for the product in the U.S. and Canada and in accordance with ISO 15197:2013.  The study was performed at Remington Davis Clinical Research in Columbus, Ohio with the Dario™ device and included 368 participants with varying demographics.  As required by FDA, the study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) which supervise the clinical studies performed in their institutions.
 
The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy of the Dario™ compared with the YSI reference standard and to evaluate how the first time users of the Dario™ (1) use it under the Dario™ guidance materials (i.e., quick user guide and video clip) in an effort to demonstrate how the use of the Dario™ device and related software could potentially improve patient care and diabetic compliance, (2) to understand the potential weaknesses of the device and introduce methods of overcoming them to the users and (3) to establish the proposition that lay users can operate the device.
 
We evaluated accuracy and user performance in this clinical trial with 368 diabetic patients, each of whom tested fresh capillary finger prick blood glucose levels while using Dario™ for the first time, as instructed at Dario™'s instruction material. System accuracy was determined with samples obtained from each subject measured both on the Dario™ by individual subjects and by a reference YSI analyzer. We documented sample collection or measurement errors. When required, repeated sampling by each subject was limited to three per subject. The interval of glucose levels tested were within BGMS range 43.0-477.0 mg/dL, and YSI range 42.3-435.5 mg/dL. There were no outliers. Accuracy for Dario™ met ISO 15197:2013 criteria, as can be seen in the accuracy tables below. Below 100 mg/dL, 97.8% of values were within ±15mg/d of YSI reference glucose values. For samples with glucose above or equal to 100 mg/dL, 96.4% of values were within ± 15% of YSI glucose levels. Lay subject performance assessment of the Dario™’s instruction clarity and usefulness showed that 100% successfully obtained a measurement result, and 97.1% of subjects found instructions easy to follow with 70.7% rating they were very satisfied (5/5) and 26.4% rating they were satisfied (4/5). Reading the result on the smart mobile device was rated easy to understand by 99.1% of lay subjects, with 86.1% rated it very easy (5/5) and 13% rated it easy (4/5). If an error message displayed on the report screen, 100% of lay subjects were clear about how to resolve the error, with 56.5% reporting is was very clear (5/5) and 43.5% reported it was clear (4/5).

To conclude, the Dario™ meets ISO 15197:2013 standards for clinical performance as determined by lay user accuracy and by satisfactory experience with the Dario™ instructions clarity and system utility.
 
In November 2015, we completed an additional User Performance evaluation study in the U.S. as requested by FDA. We evaluated the accuracy of blood glucose level results obtained from fingertip using Dario™ compared to reference equipment (YSI 2300 STATPLUS). We also assessed the usability of the Dario™ device by first time users.   The study was performed at the University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes in Aurora, Colorado with the Dario™ device and included 100 participants with varying demographics.  As required by the FDA, the study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) which supervises clinical studies performed in their institutions.

The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the accuracy of the Dario™ compared with the YSI reference standard and to evaluate how first time users of the Dario™ (1) use it under the Dario™ guidance materials (i.e., quick user guide and user guide) in an effort to demonstrate how the use of the Dario™ device and related software could potentially improve patient care and diabetic compliance, (2) to understand the potential weaknesses of the device and introduce methods of overcoming them to the users and (3) to establish the proposition that lay users can operate the device.
 
The acceptance criteria for accuracy of BGMS per ISO 15197:2003 is “Ninety-five percent (95%) of the individual glucose results shall fall within ± 15mg/dL of the results of the Dario’s measurement at glucose concentrations < 75mg/dL and within ± 20% at glucose concentrations greater than or equal to 75mg/dL”. The study evaluated accuracy and user performance in this clinical trial with 100 diabetic patients, each of whom tested fresh capillary finger prick blood glucose levels while using Dario™ for the first time, as instructed at Dario™'s instruction material. System accuracy was determined with samples obtained from each subject measured both on the Dario™ by individual subjects and by a reference YSI analyzer. We documented sample collection or measurement errors. When required, repeated sampling by each subject was limited to three per subject. The interval of glucose levels tested were within BGMS range 42-396 mg/dL, and YSI range 37-386 mg/dL. There were no outliers. Accuracy for Dario™ met ISO 15197:2003 criteria, as can be seen in the accuracy tables below. Below 75 mg/dL, 100% of values were within ±15mg/dL of YSI reference glucose values. For samples with glucose above or equal to 75 mg/dL, 98.88% of values were within ± 20% of YSI glucose levels. Lay subject performance assessment of the Dario™’s instruction clarity and usefulness showed that 100% successfully obtained a measurement result. The average rating of the users for successful operation of the Dario was 4.35 (out of 5 when 1 is “completely failed” and 5 is “very successful”) and an average rate of 3.66 (out of 5 when 1 is “very hard” and 5 is “very easy”) for operating the Dario™ for the first time.

Government Regulation
 
The principal markets that we are initially targeting for Dario™ are the United States, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand. The following is an overview of the regulatory regimes in these jurisdictions.
United States Regulation Generally 
 
In the United States, devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives clearance for commercial distribution.  Under Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a medical device is an article, which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.  The Dario™ is classified as a medical device and subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its foreign counterparts.  FDA regulations govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution.  Specifically, the FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes.  Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls.  Class II devices are somewhat more complex and require greater scrutiny.  Class III devices are new and frequently help sustain life.

14
--

 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States will require a 510(k) clearance, 510(k)+ “de-novo” clearance, or a pre-market approval (or PMA) from the FDA.
 
510(k) Clearance Process.   After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could even require a premarket application approval.  The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision.  If the FDA disagrees with the determination, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket application approval.  The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket application approval is obtained.
De Novo Classification.   If the FDA denies 510(k) clearance of a device because it is novel and an adequate predicate device does not exist, the “de novo classification” procedure can be invoked based upon reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use.  This procedure approximates the level of scrutiny in the 510(k) process but may add several months to the clearance process. If the FDA grants the request, the device is permitted to enter commercial distribution in the same manner as if 510(k) clearance had been granted.
Premarket Application Approval Process.   After approval of a premarket application, a new premarket application or premarket application supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.  The premarket application approval pathway is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain.  It generally takes from one to three years or longer.
 
European and Non-European Regulation Generally
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others.  As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing clearance may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA clearance.
 
Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union. The European Union presently requires that all medical products bear the CE mark, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and demonstrated clinical effectiveness.  Compliance with the Medical Device Directive (MDD) or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMD) or the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (IVDD) as audited by a notified body and certified by a recognized European Competent Authority, permits the manufacturer to affix the CE mark on its products.
 
In September 2013, we obtained ISO 13485 certification for our quality management system and CE Mark certification to market Dario™ and in May 2015 Dario™ was cleared to fulfil the criteria according to EN ISO 15197:2013  The granting of the CE Mark allows Dario™ to be marketed and sold in 32 countries across Europe as well as in certain other countries worldwide. On November 21, 2014, MDSS, our European Authorized Representative, completed the registration of the Dario™ Smart Meter with the German Authority as required by Article 10 of Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. We commenced an initial soft launch of the product in Europe in 2014, created initial demand for the product and established brand awareness and marketing techniques to reach our target market with a goal to continue expansion to new markets and territories.
 
We achieved regulatory clearance to market Dario™ in other countries that do not rely on the CE Mark. To date, the non-CE Mark jurisdictions which we have begun to market Dario™ include New Zealand, Canada and Australia.

--

 

In January 2014, we completed the registration with Medsafe, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority, through their WAND (Web Assisted Notification of Devices) system allowing us to sell the Dario™ in New Zealand. We also have completed the process of registering the Dario™ with the Australian TGA, in the ARTG (Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods), which is required in order to bring and sell the Dario™ in Australia and effective March 3, 2015 our product is approved for reimbursement in Australia. In February 2015, we also gained National Pharmaceutical Product Interface (known as NAPPI) approval and registered the Dario™ in South Africa. In May 2015, we also received Health Canada approval to market the Dario™ blood glucose monitoring system and commenced marketing the product. We have also received reimbursement status from the majority of insurance plans in Canada.
 
We are currently pursuing regulatory clearance in India. To the extent that we seek to market our product in other non-CE Mark countries in the future, we will be required to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in each such country.  Such regulatory requirements vary by country and may be tedious.  As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy the regulatory requirements to sell our products in any such country.
 
Clinical Studies
 
Even when a clinical study has an approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from FDA under significant risk (SR) determination, has been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) under non-significant risk (NSR) determination and/or has been approved by local or regional Ethic Committee,  the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to the fact that the institutional review board at a given clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval which is required annually, or might suspend or terminate the study before the study has been completed. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated; the interim results of a study may not be satisfactory leading the sponsor or others to terminate the study, there may be an insufficient number of patients who qualify for the study or who agree to participate in the study, or the investigator at the site may have priorities other than the study.  Also, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure regulatory authorities that the product is safe, effective and performs as intended as a prerequisite for granting market clearance. See “Clinical Trials” above for clinical trials performed to date.
 
Post-Clearance Matters
 
Even if the FDA or other non-US regulatory authorities approve or clear a device, they may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distributing the device may not be commercially feasible. After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 
A manufacturer of a device approved through the premarket approval application process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its premarket approval application and obtaining FDA clearance for that supplement.  In some instances, the FDA may require a clinical trial to support a supplement application.  A manufacturer of a device cleared through a 510(k) submission or a 510(k)+ “de-novo” submission must submit another premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source or manufacturing process.  Any change in the intended uses of a premarket approval application device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or cleared premarket notification.  Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
 
Mobile Medical Applications Guidance
 
On September 23, 2013, the FDA issued final guidance for developers of mobile medical applications, or apps, which are software programs that run on mobile communication devices and perform the same functions as traditional medical devices.  The guidance outlines the FDA’s tailored approach to mobile apps. The FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning it will not enforce requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act) for the majority of mobile apps as they pose minimal risk to consumers.  The FDA plans to focus its regulatory oversight on a subset of mobile medical apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended.  The FDA is focusing its oversight on mobile medical apps that:

16

● | are intended to be used as an accessory to a regulated medical device – for example, an application that allows a health care professional to make a specific diagnosis by viewing a medical image from a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) on a smart mobile device or a mobile tablet; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device – for example, an application that turns a smart mobile device into an electrocardiography (ECG) machine to detect abnormal heart rhythms or determine if a patient is experiencing a heart attack.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ongoing Regulation by FDA
 
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply.  These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the product life-cycle;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted PMA approvals.
 
We may be subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our or our subcontractor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product clearance, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing and selling operations.
 
Ongoing Regulation by International Regulators
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
 

17
--

 

In order to maintain the right to affix the CE Mark to sell medical devices in the European Union, an annual surveillance audit in the company premises and, if needed, at major subcontractors’ premises needs to be carried out by the notified body.  Additionally, the European Directives dictate the following requirements:
 

● | Vigilance system, which requires the manufacturer to immediately notify the relevant Competent Authority when a company product has been involved in an incident that led to a death; led to a serious injury or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person; or might have led to death, serious injury or serious deterioration in health; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post market surveillance including a documented procedure to review experience gained from devices on the market and to implement any necessary corrective action, commensurate with the nature and risks involved with the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action be the regulatory agency, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for renewing clearance and/or registration of our products or granting clearance/registration for new products.
 
State Licensure Requirements
 
Several states require that DME providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location. If these rules are determined to be applicable to us and if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce the:
 

● | referral of a person;
--+----------------------


● | furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To the extent we are required to comply with these regulations, it is possible that regulatory authorities could allege that we have not complied, which could subject us to sanction.  Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback legislation can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law”, which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services”, including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.

Federal False Claims Act
 
The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved.  In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies.  Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Federal healthcare programs.
State Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 
Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Administrative Simplification of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, mandated the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare industry. Ensuring privacy and security of patient information is one of the key factors driving the legislation.
Intellectual Property 
 
Patent applications
 
On May 8, 2011, certain of our founders filed Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT) Application No. PCT/IL2011/000369, titled “Fluids Testing Apparatus and Methods of Use”.  This PCT took priority from two preceding U.S. provisional applications filed by our founders, with the earliest priority date being May 9, 2010. The PCT application was transferred to us by our founders on October 27, 2011.
 
This application covers the novel blood glucose measurement device, comprising the glucose meter; and an adaptor that connects the glucose meter to a smart-phone to receive power supply and data display, storage and analysis.  A PCT search report and written opinion on patentability that we received from World Intellectual Property Organization (known as WIPO) was very positive, including only two “Y” citations, meaning no significant prior art was found with regards to novelty and inventiveness of the application.  Corresponding national applications of our PCT were filed in November 2012 in the U.S., Europe, and other major territories.
 
On May 1, 2014 we announced the receipt of a U.S. Notice of Allowance for a key patent relating to how the Dario™ blood glucose monitor draws power from and transmits data to a smart phone via the audio jack port. This patent was issued as U.S. Patent 8,797,180 in August 2014, and in September 2015, we were issued a U.S. patent (No. 9,125,549) that broadens our registered patent No. 8,797,180 to include testing of other bodily fluids through an audio jack connection. We believe this represents a critical intellectual property recognition and a significant initial validation of our intellectual property efforts. Further, a corresponding European patent was granted to us in May 2016, as European patent No. 2569622 for testing of fluids through an audio jack connection. Additional corresponding patents were granted in Israel. Corresponding applications for this invention are still pending in the U.S., China and Australia.

Additionally, a U.S. non-provisional and corresponding PCT application were filed, and are still pending, which cover new connection related technologies.
 
Furthermore, we filed 2 new U.S. Provisional applications, which are still pending, covering new features and functionalities related to future Dario™ generations.
 
Additional patent applications are in the process of being prepared for filing, and we believe that we have a rich pipeline of future technologies that we are actively developing.
 
We are further seeking to develop and protect new intellectual property around future generations of Dario™ hardware and software with the goal of achieving enhanced functionality, user interface and data usability.
 
Design patents and patent applications on the Dario™ device
 
To further protect our market distinction and branding for Dario™, three U.S. Design Applications have been filed and granted covering the glucose meter, the cartridge, and connection dongle. These applications were granted and registered in the United States. We have also filed national applications for the cartridge in many other jurisdictions, the great majority of which have been granted.
 
Design patents and patent applications on the Dario™ App
 
In addition, three U.S. Design Applications have been filed and granted covering our smart mobile device display screens with graphical user interface. These design application were also filed in several major jurisdictions, all of which have been granted.
 
Trademark applications
 
We have also filed three trademark applications covering the Dario™ name and logo, as well as for the DARIO-LITE word mark, and our company’s name DARIOHEALTH.  The marks were granted and registered in the United States; national applications were filed in major territories, some of which are still pending.
 
Utility Models
 
We have been granted Utility Models for our core invention in Japan and Germany.
 
Other intangible assets
 
As the number of Dario™ users grows, large amount of data will be collected from diabetic patients, comprising their blood sugar levels, meal composition and timing, physical exercise (intensity and duration) as well as many other factors, which are useful for creating meaningful correlations between these factors and insulin use.  We expect that this database will be highly valuable and may be capitalized in many ways. The accumulation of this type of know-how and related algorithms are protected as trade secrets using specialized confidentiality protocols.
Competition 
 
We face competition principally from two arenas:
 
Direct competition from existing companies in the blood based glucose monitors market.  We compete directly and primarily with large pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including, but not limited to, Abbott Laboratories, Bayer Healthcare Division, Johnson & Johnson LifeScan, Roche Diagnostics and Sanofi.  While the market is highly competitive, we believe that Dario™ has important comparative advantages versus other devices in the market. Some of these devices are now offered as connected devices to smart mobile devices, such as the Sanofi IBGStar, Medisana GlucoDock, Philosys Gmate Smart, One Drop, and iHealth Align.

The Dario™ Smart Meter offers an all-in-one glucose monitoring system, including a small form factor glucose reader, lancing device and a strip cartridge connected to existing smart mobile devices, which enables Dario™ to offer features that are similar to or superior to the most advanced meters in the market (such as Sanofi IBGStar, Gmate Smart and iHealth Align) while having a smaller form factor than the compact meters in the market (Abbott FreeStyle Lite and OneTouch UltraMini).  We believe this design will be attractive to diabetic patients.
 
Non-invasive and continuous blood glucose monitors.  While there are numerous continuous blood glucose monitoring technologies in the market, we believe they are expensive to use and are therefore offered mainly for temporary usage and in medical settings (such as hospitals) or to limited population at high risk for hypoglycemia.  There have been a wealth of attempts for noninvasive glucose monitors, but we are not aware of any that are available in the market or are expected to reach the market with significant presence over the next few years.
 
Gearing up for the expansion of DarioHealth and potential growth into the mHealth space, we are currently analyzing key players in the mobile health/digital health arena. Big Data and analytical insights are the key offerings for all segments of the market – patients, healthcare providers and payers. Our technology development focus and marketing efforts are all geared at placing us as a major player in this global market.
 
Employees
 
We currently have 30 full time employees and 1 part time employee.  We have employment agreements with our two executive officers.  See “Management – Employment Agreements”.
