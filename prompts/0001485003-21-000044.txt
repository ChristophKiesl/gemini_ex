Overview
    We are a late-stage clinical company advancing targeted fusion protein therapeutics ("TFPTs") for the treatment of patients with cancer. We genetically fuse the targeting antibody fragment and the cytotoxic protein payload into a single molecule which is produced through our proprietary one-step, microbial manufacturing process. We target tumor cell surface antigens with limited expression on normal cells. Binding of the target antigen by the TFPT allows for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell. We have designed our targeted proteins to overcome the fundamental efficacy and safety challenges inherent in existing antibody-drug conjugates ("ADCs") where a payload is chemically attached to a targeting antibody. 
Our most advanced product candidate, Vicineum, also known as VB4-845, is a locally-administered targeted fusion protein composed of an anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule ("EpCAM") antibody fragment tethered to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. 
On December 18, 2020, we submitted our completed BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to the FDA. On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that it has accepted for filing our BLA. The FDA also granted Priority Review for the BLA and the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021. In addition to the file acceptance and granting of Priority Review, the FDA also indicated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the BLA for Vicineum. 
In August 2019, we reported updated preliminary efficacy data from our ongoing single-arm, multi-center, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicineum as a monotherapy in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (the "VISTA Trial"). As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, the data reported the preliminary complete response rates ("CRRs") in evaluable carcinoma in situ ("CIS") patients following three, six, nine and 12 months of treatment in the clinical trial. The results were consistent with the results observed in the previously completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The VISTA Trial completed enrollment in April 2018 with a total of 133 patients across three cohorts based on histology and time to disease recurrence after adequate BCG treatment (under 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of NMIBC, adequate BCG is defined as at least two courses of BCG with at least five doses in an initial induction course of treatment, plus at least two doses in a second course of treatment): 
•Cohort 1 (n=86): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that was determined to be refractory or recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG; 
•Cohort 2 (n=7): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that recurred after six months, but less than 11 months, after their last course of adequate BCG; and 
•Cohort 3 (n=40): Patients with high-risk (Ta or T1) papillary disease without CIS that recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG. 
The primary endpoints of the VISTA Trial were CRR at 3 months in patients with CIS (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is BCG-unresponsive and duration of response ("DoR") for BCG-unresponsive CIS patients who experience a complete response ("CR"). 
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, preliminary primary and secondary endpoint data for each of the trial cohorts were as follows: 
Cohort 1 (n=86) Evaluable Population (n=82) Complete Response Rate, for CIS: 

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=82 | 39% (28%-50%) 
6-months | n=82 | 26% (17%-36%) 
9-months | n=82 | 20% (12%-30%) 
12-months | n=82 | 17% (10%-27%) 

*Response-evaluable population includes any modified intention-to-treat ("mITT") patient who completed the induction phase.
Cohort 2 (n=7) Evaluable Population (n=7) Complete Response Rate, for CIS: 

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=7 | 57% (18%-90%) 
6-months | n=7 | 57% (18%-90%) 
9-months | n=7 | 43% (10%-82%) 
12-months | n=7 | 14% (0%-58%) 

*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase. 
Pooled Cohorts 1 and 2 (n=93) Evaluable Population (n=89) Complete Response Rate, for CIS: 

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=89 | 40% (30%-51%) 
6-months | n=89 | 28% (19%-39%) 
9-months | n=89 | 21% (13%-31%) 
12-months | n=89 | 17% (10%-26%) 

*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
Phase 3 Pooled Complete Response Rate vs. Phase 2 Pooled Complete Response Rate: 

Time Point | Preliminary Phase 3 Pooled CRR(95% Confidence Interval) | Phase 2 Pooled CRR(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | 40% (30%-51%) | 40% (26%-56%) 
6-months | 28% (19%-39%) | 27% (15%-42%) 
9-months | 21% (13%-31%) | 18% (8%-32%) 
12-months | 17% (10%-26%) | 16% (7%-30%) 

Cohort 3 (n=40) Evaluable Population (n=38) Recurrence-Free Rate†: 

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Recurrence-Free Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=38 | 71% (54%-85%) 
6-months | n=38 | 58% (41%-74%) 
9-months | n=38 | 45% (29%-62%) 
12-months | n=38 | 42% (26%-59%) 

†Recurrence-free rate is defined as the percentage of patients that are recurrence-free at the given assessment time point. 
*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
    Duration of Response: The median DoR for patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined (n=93) is 287 days (lower 95% confidence interval ("CI") = 154 days, upper 95% confidence interval is not estimable ("NE") due to the limited number of events occurring beyond the median), using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier method is a non-parametric statistical analysis used to estimate survival times and times to event when incomplete observations in data exist. Additional ad hoc analysis of pooled data for all patients with CIS (Cohorts 1 and 2, n=93) shows that among patients who achieved a complete response at 3 months, 52% remained disease-free for a total of 12 months or longer after starting treatment, using the Kaplan-
Meier method. DoR is defined as the time from first occurrence of complete response to documentation of treatment failure or death. 
    We have conducted additional analyses for secondary endpoints based on the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date. These additional preliminary data include the following:
•Time to Cystectomy: Across all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial, greater than 75% of all patients are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis shows that approximately 88% of responders are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years. Time to cystectomy is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to surgical bladder removal. The first 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients states that the goal of therapy in such patients is to avoid cystectomy. Therefore, time to cystectomy is a key secondary endpoint in the VISTA Trial. 
•Time to Disease Recurrence: High-grade papillary (Ta or T1) NMIBC is associated with high rates of progression and recurrence. The median time to disease recurrence for patients in Cohort 3 (n=40) is 402 days (95% CI, 170-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Time to disease recurrence is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of treatment failure or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation. 
•Progression-Free Survival ("PFS"): 90% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain progression-free for 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression (e.g., T2 or more advanced disease) or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation. 
•Event-Free Survival: 29% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain event-free at 12 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Event-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease recurrence, progression or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation. 
•Overall Survival ("OS"): 96% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to have an overall survival of 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death from any cause. 
Preliminary Safety Results
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%) - all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial. 
Other Vicineum Activity
In August 2018, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. 
In May 2019, we met with the FDA for a Type C meeting regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and reached agreement with the FDA on the analytical comparability plan to be used to assess comparability between the drug supply used in clinical trials and the potential commercial drug supply to be produced by Fujifilm. We also confirmed with the FDA that, subject to final comparability data to be provided in the BLA submission, no additional clinical trials were deemed necessary to establish comparability.
In June 2019, we met with the FDA for a Type B Pre-BLA meeting regarding the approval pathway for Vicineum for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. At the meeting, we reached alignment with the FDA on an accelerated approval pathway for Vicineum along with Rolling Review. "Rolling Review" of the BLA enables individual modules to be submitted and reviewed on an ongoing basis, rather than waiting for all sections to be completed before submission. The FDA also indicated that the clinical data, nonclinical data, clinical pharmacology data, and the safety database were sufficient to support a BLA submission, and that no additional clinical trials were necessary for a BLA submission. Per the official FDA minutes received post-meeting, the FDA stated that the pre-licensing inspection may be completed at the time of process performance qualification manufacturing, which we believe will benefit the overall review timeline for the BLA. In 
addition, the FDA communicated that they expected that a meeting with the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee ("ODAC") will be required as part of the accelerated approval pathway. If Vicineum receives marketing approval for treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, a post-marketing confirmatory trial will also be required.
In November 2019, we met with the FDA for a Type C meeting to discuss the details of a post-marketing confirmatory trial for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. At that meeting, we reached agreement with the FDA that the post-marketing confirmatory trial for Vicineum will enroll BCG-refractory patients who have received less-than-adequate BCG, which is especially important in light of the ongoing BCG shortage. This represents a broader patient population than the BCG-intolerant population originally proposed. We anticipate that, if Vicineum is approved by the FDA, the initial indication will be for BCG-unresponsive patients who have received adequate BCG. If the post-marketing confirmatory trial is successful, it could result in an expanded label to include this additional population of patients who have received less-than-adequate BCG. 
On December 4, 2019, we met with the FDA for a Type B pre-BLA meeting for CMC. At that meeting, we reached agreement with the FDA on the final content for Module 3 (CMC) of the BLA.
On December 6, 2019, we initiated our BLA submission for Vicineum to the FDA under Rolling Review. This submission consisted of Modules 1, 2, 4 and 5 only. 
On May 7, 2020, we received clinical Scientific Advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") of the EMA stating that the Committee agreed that our nonclinical, clinical pharmacology and safety database are all sufficient to support a MAA. Furthermore, additional clinical trials were not requested by the CHMP in support of the MAA submission for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. 
On May 29, 2020, we received CMC Scientific Advice from the CHMP of the EMA, stating that the committee agreed that our comparability plan provides a strong analytical package, and no additional clinical trials to establish comparability are deemed necessary at this time. Furthermore, the CHMP agreed to accept the current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") inspections conducted by the FDA and will therefore not conduct an independent inspection of the manufacturing facilities.
On June 17, 2020, we were informed that the FDA has conditionally accepted the proprietary brand name VICINEUM™ for our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox. The name VICINEUM was developed in compliance with the FDA’s final Guidance for Industry, Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names and the FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry, Best Practices in Developing Proprietary Name for Drugs. We believe VICINEUM is a proprietary name with strong marketing potential that is also consistent with FDA’s goal of preventing medication errors and potential harm to the public by ensuring that only appropriate proprietary names are approved for use. Final approval of the VICINEUM brand name is conditional on FDA approval of our product candidate, oportuzumab monatox. Based upon FDA feedback, we withdrew our previously submitted proposed brand name, VICINIUM®, from consideration due to potential for confusion with ammonium derivative products with the “-ium” suffix as established by the United States Adopted Names Council.
On July 28, 2020, we received notice from the EMA that it has approved our request to review Vicineum under the EMA’s centralized authorization procedure drug review process and on September 29, 2020, we received notice from the EMA that it has appointed the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur for our planned MAA. The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur are members of EMA’s CHMP and will jointly coordinate CHMP’s evaluation of our MAA for Vicineum.
On October 23, 2020, we completed a successful pre-submission meeting with the EMA which addressed product specific, legal, regulatory and scientific topics related to Vicineum. The information and insights gained from the meeting will help to facilitate the validation of the MAA and support a smooth evaluation. The agency also provided guidance on various administrative topics which helps to clarify the regulatory path forward. 
We held two successful meetings with the assigned Rapporteurs on November 2, 2020 and December 14, 2020 in which we received guidance on the contents of the MAA. The success of these meetings, in addition to the receipt of centralized procedure eligibility confirmation from the EMA, are significant milestones toward our regulatory path forward in Europe and supported our MAA submission on March 5, 2021, with potential approval anticipated in early 2022.
On December 18, 2020, we submitted the completed BLA, including Module 3 (CMC), to the FDA. After we submitted the BLA to the FDA, we were invited to participate in an Application Orientation Meeting, which is available in certain Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER") review divisions, at the review team’s discretion, for priority applications where early action is expected and/or desired. The objectives of an Application Orientation Meeting include familiarizing the FDA with application datasets, discussing scientific aspects including clinical risk-benefit, and establishing early communication between applicants and the FDA.
On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that it has accepted for filing our BLA. The FDA also granted Priority Review for the BLA and the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021. In addition to the file acceptance and granting of Priority Review, the FDA also indicated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the BLA for Vicineum. 
On March 5, 2021, we submitted the MAA to the EMA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC under the EMA’s centralized procedure.
Manufacturing
    In October 2018, we entered into a Master Bioprocessing Services Agreement with Fujifilm (the "Fujifilm MSA") for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug substance production. 
In November 2019, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Baxter (the "Baxter CSA") for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug product production. 
In April 2019, the first full, commercial-scale cGMP run was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing was completed and all Phase 3 release specifications were met, supporting Fujifilm’s ability to produce the bulk drug substance form of Vicineum for commercial purposes if we receive regulatory approval to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. 
In February 2020, manufacturing of the pre-process performance qualification ("pre-PPQ") cGMP batch was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing of the drug substance was completed and all quality acceptance criteria were met. 
On August 4, 2020, we completed manufacturing of the drug substance PPQ batches at Fujifilm and in September 2020, we successfully completed the final of three drug product PPQ batches at Baxter. All of the completed drug substance PPQ batches and drug product PPQ batches met all quality acceptance criteria. 
In December 2020, we received and analyzed all of the analytical comparability test results from the drug substance and drug product PPQ batches. For analytical comparability, we conducted testing across four categories: release testing, biophysical characterization, forced degradation studies, and stability studies. This approach is in alignment with requirements of the FDA, the EMA and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The test results for product intended for commercial use were found to be highly comparable to the Company’s clinical supply of Vicineum. Based on these results, we are optimistic that the FDA will determine that the commercial supply of Vicineum is comparable to the clinical supply of Vicineum, and that no additional clinical trials are warranted. The comparability data from the PPQ campaigns for both drug substance and drug product were the final material components of our completed BLA, which was submitted to the FDA on December 18, 2020. 
In December 2020, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply framework agreement with Qilu (the "Qilu CMO Framework Agreement") for Qilu to be a contract manufacturer for the global commercial supply of Vicineum. We believe that the technology transfer to Qilu for the manufacturing of Vicineum is on track to be completed in mid-2021. 
Commercial Partnering
On July 30, 2020, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Viventia Bio, Inc., entered into an exclusive license agreement with Qilu ("Qilu License Agreement") pursuant to which we granted Qilu an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by us, to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC and other types of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan ("Greater China"). We also granted Qilu a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing sublicense, under certain other intellectual property licensed by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum in Greater China. We retain (i) development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world excluding Greater China and MENA and (ii) manufacturing rights with respect to Vicineum in the rest of the world excluding Greater China. 
We have received a total of $10 million in net proceeds associated with the $12 million upfront payment due pursuant to the Qilu License Agreement. We are also entitled to receive up to an additional $23 million upon the achievement of certain technology transfer, development and regulatory milestones, as well as a 12% royalty based upon annual net sales of Vicineum in Greater China. The royalties are payable upon the first commercial sale of Vicineum in a region and continuing until the latest of (i) twelve years after the first commercial sale of Vicineum in such region, (ii) the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering or claiming the composition of matter, method of treatment, or method of manufacture of such Vicineum in such region, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory or data exclusivity for such Vicineum in such region. The royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances, including when there is no valid claim of a licensed patent that covers Vicineum in a particular region or no data or regulatory exclusivity of Vicineum in a particular region. 
The Investigational New Drug application for Vicineum submitted by Qilu to the Center for Drug Evaluation of the China National Medical Products Administration was accepted for review in January 2021.
On November 30, 2020, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals LLC ("Hikma") (the "Hikma License Agreement"), pursuant to which we granted Hikma an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by us, to commercialize Vicineum in the Middle East 
and North Africa ("MENA") region. We retain development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world excluding Greater China and MENA. In consideration for the rights granted by us, Hikma agreed to pay to us an upfront payment, sales related milestones payments, and royalties on net sales in the MENA region for the term of the Hikma License Agreement. 
We maintain global development, marketing and commercialization rights for all of our TFPT-based product candidates. We intend to explore various commercialization strategies to market our approved products. If we obtain regulatory approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we intend to build a North American specialty urology sales force to market the product in the United States. Outside the United States, we will continue to seek additional commercialization partners with urology expertise. We also own or exclusively license worldwide intellectual property rights for all of our TFPT-based product candidates, covering our key patents with protection into 2036. See ‘‘Our Intellectual Property’’ below for additional details.
Our TFTP Platform
    Our current product candidates are based on our proprietary TFPT platform and are focused on addressing areas of unmet medical need in cancer. Our novel TFPTs have been designed to overcome the efficacy and safety challenges of existing ADCs and are being developed for both local and systemic administration. Our TFPTs are single protein therapeutics composed of targeting domains genetically fused via peptide linkers to cytotoxic protein payloads that are produced through our proprietary recombinant one-step, microbial manufacturing process. Our TFPT platform uses protein binding antibody fragments, which include Fabs, single chain variable domains ("ScFvs"), and non-covalent scFv dimers ("diabodies"), derived from the domains of antibodies that confer antigen recognition. We select antibody fragments for our product candidates depending upon the target therapeutic indication. We target tumor cell surface antigens that allow for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell and that also have limited expression in normal cells. For local administrations, we utilize an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload designed to both target cancer cells and promote a heightened local immune response against the tumor. For systemic administrations, we use deBouganin, a plant-derived, protein payload of reduced immunogenic potential that we believe can be repeatedly administered via infusion without the generation of an efficacy-limiting immune response against the payload.
Locally-administered TFPTs
    We utilize our TFPTs with immunogenic cytotoxic protein payloads for tumors that can be targeted locally rather than systemically. Local administration allows for the TFPT to reach the tumor without being cleared by the immune system, which enables us to maximize the concentration of TFPTs directly to tumors. Our locally-administered TFPT Vicineum, which is our lead product candidate in development for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, contains a targeting antibody binding domain that is designed to bind to EpCAM, a protein over-expressed in many cancers. This binding domain is genetically fused to a truncated form of exotoxin A ("ETA"), which is an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is produced by the bacterial species Pseudomonas. This product candidate is designed to bind to EpCAM on the surface of cancer cells. The TFPT-EpCAM complex is subsequently internalized into the cell and, once inside the cell, the TFPT is cleaved by a cellular enzyme to release the cytotoxic protein payload, thus enabling cancer cell killing.
    We also believe that our TFPTs designed for local administration may not only directly kill cancer cells through targeted delivery of a cytotoxic protein payload, but also potentiate an anti-cancer therapeutic immune response. This immune response is believed to be triggered by the immunogenic cell death of the cancer cells due to our payload's mechanism of action and the subsequent release of tumor antigens and the immunologically active setting created by the nature of the cytotoxic protein payloads. We believe that this immune response may also enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors, that require a pre-existing immune response for maximum efficacy.
    Our most advanced locally-administered TFTP product candidate is Vicineum, in development for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ("SCCHN"). This TFTP is not, however, suitable for systemic administration over multiple doses because the body’s immune system would recognize and eliminate foreign proteins, such as ETA, prior to their reaching targeted cancer cells.
Systemically-administered TFPTs
    We also utilize our TFPTs with a de-immunized payload where systemic administration is required. Our systemically-administered TFPTs are built around deBouganin. Since the body’s immune system naturally recognizes and attempts to eliminate foreign proteins, we designed our systemically administered TFPTs with a deBouganin payload to avoid inducing an immunogenic response. DeBouganin is constructed by mutating the immunogenic T-cell epitopes from bouganin so that they are not recognized as foreign by the immune system. However, we also believe that deBouganin may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors as a result of the promotion of a local tumor immune response following the death of cancer cells. Our systemically-administered product candidate is VB6-845d for the treatment of multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors. 
Our Differentiated Approach to Targeted Therapies
    We believe that our TFPT platform will address many challenges experienced with existing ADCs. The basic construct for our TFPTs and existing ADCs is similar as each is comprised of a targeting domain that specifically binds to cancer cells and delivers a cytotoxic payload. However, existing ADCs have been associated with limitations that we believe are addressed by our TFPTs.
Limitations of Existing ADC Approaches to Treating Tumors 
    We believe existing ADCs have the following fundamental efficacy and safety challenges:
•Deliver insufficient drug to tumors. Existing ADCs utilize full-length antibodies, which, due to their large size, have a reduced ability to penetrate tumors, thereby potentially reducing their efficacy.
•Inability to kill a broad array of cancer cells within a tumor. Subsets of cancer cells within tumors may have mechanisms to resist and not be responsive to the cytotoxic payloads, or small molecule chemotherapies, used in existing ADCs.
•Off-target toxicities due to unstable chemical linkage between targeting antibody and cytotoxic payload. Existing ADCs utilize chemical linkage strategies to join antibodies to small molecule cytotoxic payloads. While in the circulatory system, these chemical linkages can break and release free cytotoxic payloads in the circulation. These free small molecule cytotoxic payloads are not targeted and cannot discriminate between dividing cancer cells and non-cancerous cells, thus resulting in increased off-target toxicities.
•Limited combination therapy potential. Adverse events may limit the potential utility of existing ADCs in combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors which have their own adverse events, including immune-related adverse events.
•Complex and challenging manufacturing process. The multi-step manufacturing process of existing ADCs creates a non-homogeneous product that limits efficacy and drives greater costs than those estimated for our manufacturing process.
Advantages of our TFPT Platform
    We believe our TFPTs offer the following key advantages:
•Deliver a greater amount of drug to tumors. Our TFPTs are designed using smaller targeting proteins that have an increased ability to exit the circulatory system and have binding properties designed to enable deeper penetration into targeted tumors, and we believe this will increase efficacy.
•Ability to kill a broader array of cancer cells within a tumor. Our novel cytotoxic payloads consist of proteins rather than small molecule cytotoxic payloads. We believe the larger size of our cytotoxic protein payloads helps circumvent multi-drug resistance mechanisms that can make certain cancer cells resistant to small molecule cytotoxic payloads. By contrast to existing ADCs, which employ cytotoxic payloads that inhibit cellular replication and are effective at killing rapidly proliferating cancer cells, our cytotoxic protein payloads inhibit protein synthesis and are designed to kill not only rapidly proliferating, but also slowly growing cancer cells including tumor progenitor cells/cancer stem-like cells.
•Increase safety due to a more stable linkage between targeting protein and cytotoxic payload. Our single protein molecules are designed to remain intact until they reach the inside of the cancer cell and to not release free cytotoxins into the circulatory system, thereby minimizing off-target toxicity.
•Promote a therapeutic immune response. We believe that the potent TFPT toxin-mediated killing of cancer cells in this immunologically active setting leads to the efficient presentation of cancer antigens to the immune system, thereby promoting an anti-tumor cellular immune response. Our locally-administered TFPTs utilize an immunogenic cytotoxic payload that we believe promotes a heightened immune response in the local tumor environment.
•Potential combination with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that the potential effect of checkpoint inhibitors, which are antibodies that promote the action of anti-tumor T-cells by blocking inhibitory ligand/receptor interactions that include PD-1 and PD-L1, may be enhanced when used in combination with other agents. We believe that, by mediating specific killing of tumor cells and promoting anti-tumor immune responses, our TFPTs, while potentially effective on their own, may complement checkpoint inhibitors. In particular, we believe that the use of our cytotoxin payload ETA, which induces immunogenic cell death, may facilitate the presentation of tumor cell surface antigens following the death of cancer cells, thereby providing a tumor immune response to enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
•Utilize a simpler and more efficient manufacturing process. Our proprietary recombinant one-step manufacturing process creates a homogeneous product that we believe will improve efficacy and result in lower manufacturing costs.
Our Strategy
    We are committed to designing, engineering, developing and commercializing TFPTs to identify and address oncology indications that suffer from a high unmet medical need. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
•Obtain regulatory approval of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. On December 18, 2020, we submitted the completed BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that it has accepted for filing the BLA, and granted the application Priority Review. With Priority Review, the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021. In addition, the FDA stated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the BLA for Vicineum. We initiated discussions with the EMA in 2020 regarding a regulatory pathway for European Union (“E.U.”) approval and completed all pre-submission activities by the end of 2020, and submitted the MAA to the EMA on March 5, 2021.
•Maximize the commercial potential Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We own exclusive, worldwide rights to Vicineum and we have out licensed the rights to Vicineum in Greater China and the MENA region. If Vicineum receives marketing approval from the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we plan to pursue commercialization strategies that maximize the value of Vicineum in the United States by partnering with a contract sales organization. Based on our market research, we believe Vicineum has an innovative profile with a high possibility that patients, healthcare professionals and payors will be advocates for its use for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, which we believe represents a significant commercial opportunity. We believe that we will be able to effectively communicate differentiating characteristics and key attributes of Vicineum to patients, physicians and payors, with the goal of establishing favorable reimbursement as well as a favorable formulary status in targeted Urology practices. Additionally, we believe that our plans to partner with a contract sales organization should allow us to address the Urologists-initiated treatment market for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the United States in an efficient and effective way. 
•Expand on the value of Vicineum through strategic partnerships. If we obtain regulatory approval for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, we intend to build a North American specialty urology sales force to market the product in the United States. Outside the United States, we will continue to seek additional commercialization partners with urology expertise by selectively partnering with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies when we believe that a partner could bring additional resources and expertise to maximize the value of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In 2020, we entered into license agreements to support such commercialization efforts outside the United States.
•Explore opportunities in combination therapies. We plan to continue discussions with potential partners that utilize technologies whose mechanism of action could be complementary to our TFPT platform. These technologies include, but are not limited to, checkpoint inhibitors, immune modulators and other immuno-oncology agents. In June 2017, we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA") with the NCI for the development of Vicineum in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab for the treatment of NMIBC. Under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological correlates of Vicineum in combination with durvalumab. This Phase 1 clinical trial is open and actively recruiting patients. 
    We have deferred further development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN and of VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development and, if approved, the commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We are also exploring collaborations for Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN and for VB6-845d.
Our Product Pipeline
    At this time, we are focused exclusively on the clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and have deferred further development of our other product candidates. The following table sets forth our current development stage programs:
Vicineum for the Treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC
Overview
    Vicineum is being developed for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in patients who have previously received adequate BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive. Vicineum is administered by intravesical administration directly into the bladder. Vicineum utilizes an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is a truncated form of ETA produced by the bacterial species Pseudomonas. Vicineum also includes an anti-EpCAM ScFv targeting domain that is required to deliver the ETA into EpCAM-expressing cancer cells. The toxicity to non-cancerous bladder cells is minimized due to their not having EpCAM over-expressed on their surface.
    Based upon our September 2014 end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we, through our subsidiary Viventia, commenced the Phase 3 VISTA Trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC who have received adequate BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, and for whom the then-current standard of care was the surgical removal of their bladder, or a radical cystectomy, in the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Canada. Based on safety and efficacy data observed with the longer 12-week induction in our Phase 2 clinical trial, the FDA agreed to our plan to employ more frequent dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial, in which the primary endpoints are CR and DoR in patients with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive. In November 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new drugs and biologics for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including the use of single-arm trials. The FDA finalized this guidance in February 2018 and retained many of the recommendations from the 2016 draft guidance regarding clinical trial design, including the use of single-arm trials. We believe that our VISTA Trial design was consistent with these aspects of the FDA’s guidance. We completed enrollment in the VISTA Trial in April 2018 and reported updated preliminary efficacy data in August 2019. In August 2018, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. On December 6, 2019, we initiated our BLA submission for Vicineum to the FDA under Rolling Review. This submission consisted of Modules 1, 2, 4 and 5 only. On December 18, 2020, we submitted the completed BLA, including Module 3 (CMC), to the FDA. On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that it has accepted for filing our BLA. The FDA also granted Priority Review for the BLA and the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021. In addition to the file acceptance and granting of Priority Review, the FDA also indicated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the BLA for Vicineum. We initiated discussions with the EMA in 2020 regarding a regulatory pathway for E.U. approval and submitted the MAA on March 5, 2021.
    Overall, we believe that our efficacy and safety data support the continued clinical development and, if approved, the commercialization of Vicineum to fulfill a significant unmet medical need in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Because Vicineum contains ETA, an immunogenic cytotoxic payload that elicits an anti-ETA immune response, we believe the local administration of Vicineum may amplify the local host immune response within the tumor environment killing bladder cancer 
cells through an Immunogenic Cell Death ("ICD") mechanism. In addition, we believe that this ICD response, which potentiates host immune responses against neoantigens present on the cancer cells, can lead to a heightened host immune response against their own tumor and potentially complement checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
    We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our Vicineum intellectual property portfolio that provides an unextended patent term until 2036. See ‘‘Our Intellectual Property’’ below for additional details.
Disease Overview
    Most cancers that form in the bladder are transitional cell carcinomas that derive from the transitional cell lining of the bladder. Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder can be characterized as either high-grade or low-grade. Low-grade bladder cancer often recurs in the lining of the bladder after treatment, but rarely invades the muscular wall of the bladder or spreads to other parts of the body and is unlikely to be fatal. High-grade bladder cancer commonly recurs in the bladder, has a strong tendency to invade the muscular wall of the bladder, and spread to other parts of the body and is much more likely to result in death. Bladder cancer is also divided into muscle-invasive and NMIBC, based on invasion of the muscularis propria, which is the thick muscle deep in the bladder wall. Muscle-invasive disease is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.
    There are three forms of high-grade NMIBC: Ta, a papillary tumor in the innermost layer of the bladder lining; T1, a papillary tumor that has started to grow into the connective tissue beneath the bladder lining; and CIS, flat lesions of the transitional cell lining of the bladder. Papillary tumors are generally low-grade with low risk of progression, although about two to nine percent are high-grade, with a moderately high risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. CIS tumors are always high-grade, with a worse prognosis than papillary tumors, as such CIS tumors are more aggressive, with a higher probability of progression to muscle-invasive disease. Furthermore, the incidence of CIS in conjunction with Ta or T1 tumors results in a higher risk of recurrence and progression. About 75% to 85% of bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive. Of these, Ta tumors account for about 70%, T1 tumors account for about 20% and CIS lesions account for about 10%. 
    Bladder cancer is the twelfth most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and the second most common malignancy of the genitourinary system. In 2018, there were an estimated 539,000 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed and 200,000 deaths worldwide. The global prevalence of bladder cancer is estimated at 2.7 million individuals. The NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Result Program ("SEER") estimated that approximately 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer would be diagnosed in 2019 and there would be approximately 18,000 deaths due to bladder cancer in the United States during 2019. Based on a 2014 publication in Current Opinion in Urology, among cancers in the United States, bladder cancer has the highest per-patient treatment costs, with an estimated overall cost of approximately $4.0 billion annually. In the United States, bladder cancer has the highest overall cost among the elderly. Based on our assessment of the market, the treatment paradigm has remained the same since those figures were generated, and we believe the cost of care has increased.
    NMIBC makes up 75% to 85% of all bladder cancers. The high recurrence rate and ongoing invasive monitoring requirement of bladder cancers are the key contributors to the economic and human toll of this disease. Bladder cancer occurs predominantly in older patients (about nine of the 10 people with bladder cancer are over the age of 55 years). The median age at diagnosis is approximately 72 years. Overall, the five-year survival rate for bladder cancer in the United States is 77%. While the five-year survival rates are 98% for stage zero and 88% for stage one NMIBC, once the cancer becomes invasive, the rates drop dramatically with five-year survival rates of 63%, 46% and 15% for stage two, three and four muscle invasive bladder cancers, respectively. We are targeting patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Our initial target market includes the approximately 25,000 patients diagnosed annually, including those patients who have previously failed BCG and have refused cystectomy. We would expect that, if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC is approved by the FDA, patients would receive treatment until the earlier of 2 years and disease recurrence.
Current Approaches to Treatment
    Within BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, the initial treatment of Ta or T1 is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor ("TURBT") followed by BCG treatment. For CIS, whether or not TURBT is an option, BCG is the standard of care. BCG is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, with a diminished virulence in humans. Since BCG works by utilizing an immune/inflammatory mechanism, BCG is generally initiated only two to four weeks after TURBT, allowing the urothelium to heal and lowering the risk of systemic infection. When high-grade bladder tumors have been completely resected, BCG is used as adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence. In patients with residual disease after resection, BCG helps to eradicate residual disease and delay progression. The BCG regimen consists of an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase. The induction phase involves six consecutive once-weekly instillations of the drug into the bladder. The maintenance phase involves three consecutive once-weekly instillations repeated every three to six months for at least one year. The response rate to a single induction phase of BCG is 60% to 70% with an additional 30% to 50% of the non-responders becoming responders following a second induction phase. However, BCG’s failure rate for all responders is estimated to be as high as 50% within the first 12 months of treatment and 90% within five years. 
    For patients who received BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, radical cystectomy has been recommended due to the risk of progression to muscle invasive disease, which greatly reduces a patient’s prognosis. Radical cystectomy is a complex surgery associated with a significant morbidity rate of 28% to 45% and a mortality rate of 8% within six months of surgery. The surgery also entails a number of short-term risks including bleeding and/or clots, infections, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, peritonitis and injury to the urethra. More than 25% of radical cystectomy patients require readmission for surgery-related complications within 90 days following surgery, and 34% require emergency room visits. The impact of radical cystectomy is life-altering, with major lifestyle changes, including incontinence and sexual dysfunction, and daily issues related to management of the external bag for urine collection.
    In January 2020, the FDA approved Merck & Co., Inc.'s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) as a systemic monotherapy to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy. In 2009, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Valstar (valrubicin) was re-launched in the United States for the treatment of BCG-refractory CIS bladder cancer in patients for whom radical cystectomy is not an option. Valstar is administered intravesically directly into the bladder once a week for six weeks. Due to drug resistance and toxicities, Valstar has had limited utility. Other than Keytruda and Valstar, there are no other approved therapies for BCG-unresponsive CIS bladder cancer. However, there are various other intravesical product candidates in development for the treatment of NMIBC, including product candidates developed by FerGene Inc. (Adstiladrin/nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3)), AADi, LLC (ABI-009), ImmunityBio (Anktiva/N-803 in combination with BCG), Theralase Technologies Inc. (TLD-1433), Janssen (Erdafitinib and TAR-200) and CG Oncology (CG0070). In addition, systemically-administered checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated for the treatment of NMIBC including products developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Opdivo alone or in combination with BCG +/- BMS986205), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Tecentriq) and AstraZeneca (Imfinzi).
Phase 1 and 2 Clinical Trials
    Phase 1 Clinical Trial. We initiated an open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in September 2004 at 22 sites in Canada. We enrolled 64 patients with high-grade Ta or T1 tumors with or without CIS (17 of which had CIS) and who had previously received at least one treatment of BCG. The Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase 2 dose. The secondary objective was to explore the anti-tumor activity of Vicineum. 
    Eight dose levels were initially evaluated, ranging from 0.1 to 10.56 mg, and given once weekly for six consecutive weeks. Each dose was administered by instillation and held for two hours prior to voiding. Safety data from each dose cohort was evaluated after three weeks of treatment before proceeding to the next dose cohort. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached; therefore, additional escalations through 13.73 mg, 17.85 mg, 23.20 mg and 30.16 mg were undertaken. No dose-limiting toxicities ("DLTs") were reported and no maximum tolerated dose was reached in these additional dose-escalations. Vicineum was generally well-tolerated at each of these escalated doses. 
    A CR was defined in this Phase 1 clinical trial as non-positive urine cytology and either normal cystoscopy or abnormal cystoscopy with negative biopsy. Of the 64 patients enrolled, only 61 were considered to be evaluable for efficacy as two patients were excluded from the analysis due to an absence of BCG treatment prior to this Phase 1 clinical trial, and there was one unrelated death for whom no final tumor assessment was obtained. Evidence of clinical efficacy, as defined by a CR, was achieved by 24 of the 61 randomized patients (39%). Only three of the 17 patients (18%) treated in the 0.1-<1 mg/dose range were CRs. In contrast, seven of the 14 patients (50%) treated in 1.0-<10 mg/dose range and 14 of the 30 patients (46.7%) treated in the ≥10 mg/dose range experienced CRs at the three-month assessment. Of the patients with CIS, five of the 17 patients (29%) achieved a CR, while non-recurrence was observed in seven of the 16 patients with T1 (43.8%) and 12 of the 28 patients with Ta (42.8%). This Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in April 2006.
    Phase 2 Clinical Trial. Based on our Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Canada, we submitted the IND for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to the FDA in August 2005, and we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Vicineum in March 2007 at 20 sites in Canada and the United States. We enrolled 46 patients with CIS (with or without Ta or T1) who had previously received at least one treatment of BCG. Of the 46 patients enrolled, 27 patients (58.7%) had received at least two treatments of BCG. The Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to determine the tolerability and explore the potential for clinical benefit from Vicineum. Clinical benefit was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as a CR or no evidence of disease at the three-month evaluation. A CR was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as no histological evidence of disease and negative urine cytology. Any cases with no histological evidence of disease on initial biopsy but atypical or suspicious urine cytology were also considered CRs only if they remained negative after being evaluated with repeat biopsy, directed and random. A patient was considered to have a durable CR if that patient obtained a CR and remained disease-free for a period of at least 12 months from initiation of treatment. 
    The dosing regimen for our Phase 2 clinical trial included an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase, consisting of three weekly treatments and then nine weeks of no treatment repeated every three months for at least one year. There were two treatment groups in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Treatment Arm A consisted of 23 patients, of which 22 were 
ultimately evaluable as one patient violated eligibility requirements early in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Twenty-two patients in the induction phase received six consecutive once-weekly instillations of 30 mg of Vicineum. At the three-month assessment, patients with residual disease but no disease progression-where disease progression was defined as being muscle invasive-were eligible for either a second induction phase or a maintenance phase, which consisted of three consecutive once-weekly instillations repeated every three months for at least one year. Of the 13 patients who did not achieve a CR at the three-month assessment, nine patients elected additional treatment. From these nine, two became CRs after receiving maintenance dosing. Treatment Arm B was added to evaluate a longer induction cycle using the same dose. In Treatment Arm B, 23 patients in the induction phase received 12 consecutive once-weekly instillations of 30 mg Vicineum. At the three-month assessment, the combined CR rate for both treatment arms was 40%. At the 12-month assessment, the CR rate in Treatment Arm A was 13%, but 17% in Treatment Arm B. Of those patients who did not achieve a CR at the three-month assessment, 73% had either a reduction in tumor size or did not experience further tumor growth.
    The data below shows the percentage change in surface area of cancer within the bladder, based on bladder mapping data utilizing cystoscopy in 40 patients. The following charts demonstrate the responses in this Phase 2 clinical trial in Treatment Arm A and Treatment Arm B:
    This Phase 2 clinical trial was completed in September 2009.
    Near the completion of this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2009, Valstar was re-launched in the United States for the treatment of BCG-refractory CIS bladder cancer in patients for whom immediate cystectomy would be associated with unacceptable morbidity or mortality. However, because physicians were not widely prescribing Valstar to their patients and it was not an approved therapy in Europe, this disrupted our originally designed clinical path of a head-to-head pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicineum against Valstar. Due to the uncertainty of the standard of care in this space, our efforts were put on hold until a clear clinical path was established. In May 2013, the FDA co-sponsored a public workshop where it evaluated potential trial designs for the development of therapies for NMIBC and specifically provided regulatory guidance supporting the idea that a single-arm clinical trial could provide sufficient evidence of benefit if the results were robust. The panel suggested it is acceptable to include high-risk papillary patients without CIS in a clinical trial with CIS patients because the clinical management and outcome if left untreated is considered to be the same. In September 2014, we conducted an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and, consistent with our interactions with the FDA during this meeting, refocused our resources to commence an open-label, non-randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicineum in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.
    Safety data. We believe that our safety data from 110 patients in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials support further development of Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC BCG failures. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigators to be related to Vicineum during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC BCG failures. There was one Grade 5 serious adverse event, or death, which was determined by the clinical investigator to be unrelated to Vicineum. The most common reported treatment-related adverse events were an abnormally frequent passage of small amounts of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination, the majority of which were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. No patients discontinued treatment due to a Vicineum-related adverse event during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial
    Based upon our September 2014 end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we, through our subsidiary Viventia, commenced the Phase 3 VISTA Trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC who have received adequate BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, and for whom the then-current standard of care was the surgical removal of their bladder, or a radical cystectomy, in the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Canada. Based on safety and efficacy data observed with the longer 12-week induction in our Phase 2 clinical trial, the FDA agreed to our plan to employ more frequent dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial, in which the primary endpoints are CR and DoR in patients with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive. In November 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new drugs and biologics for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including the use of single-arm trials. The FDA finalized this guidance in February 2018 and retained many of the recommendations from the 2016 draft guidance regarding clinical trial design, including the use of single-arm trials. We believe that our VISTA Trial design was consistent with these aspects of the FDA’s guidance. 
    As part of this trial, in July 2015, we submitted a Clinical Trial Application ("CTA") to Health Canada to include Canadian sites. In September 2015, we received a No Objection Letter from Health Canada, permitting us to proceed with our Phase 3 VISTA Trial in Canada. 
    The primary and secondary endpoints for the VISTA Trial are as follows:

Dose | 30 mg of Vicineum (in 50 mL of saline) 
Total enrollment | 133 patients, including 93 CIS patients whose disease is BCG-unresponsive
Primary endpoints | • | CRR at 3 months in patients with CIS (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is BCG-unresponsive; and
 | • | Kaplan-Meier estimate of DoR for BCG-unresponsive CIS patients who experience a CR. 

Patients with CIS will be considered to have a CR if at the time of any disease status evaluation (per protocol every 13 weeks or any unscheduled evaluation) there is no evidence of high-grade disease (CIS, high-grade Ta or any grade T1 disease) or disease progression (e.g., to muscle invasive disease). Low-grade disease is not considered a treatment failure in these patients, and they may remain on study treatment following TURBT.

Secondary endpoints | • | Event-free survival in all patients; 
 | • | CRR at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months in patients with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive;
 | • | Time to cystectomy in all patients; 
 | • | Time to disease recurrence in papillary patients; 
 | • | PFS in all patients; 
 | • | OS in all patients; and 
 | • | Safety and tolerability of Vicineum therapy in all patients. 
Exploratory endpoint | To evaluate biomarkers that may be associated with response or disease progression or treatment failure, which may include, for example, EpCAM status, tumor subtype morphology, furin levels in tumor cell endosomes, presence of a glycosaminoglycan coat and presence of receptors that could impede a host anti-tumor immune response, such as PD-L1.

    The VISTA Trial completed enrollment in April 2018 with a total of 133 patients across three cohorts based on histology and time to disease recurrence after adequate BCG treatment (under 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of NMIBC, adequate BCG is defined as at least two courses of BCG with at least five doses in an initial induction course of treatment, plus at least two doses in a second course of treatment):
•Cohort 1 (n=86): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that was determined to be refractory or recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG;
•Cohort 2 (n=7): Patients with CIS with or without papillary disease that recurred after six months, but less than 11 months, after their last course of adequate BCG; and 
•Cohort 3 (n=40): Patients with high-risk (Ta or T1) papillary disease without CIS that recurred within six months of their last course of adequate BCG.

As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, preliminary primary and secondary endpoint data for each of the trial cohorts were as follows:
Cohort 1 (n=86) Evaluable Population (n=82) Complete Response Rate, for CIS:

Time Point | Evaluable Patients* | Complete Response Rate(95% Confidence Interval)
3-months | n=82 | 39% (28%-50%) 
6-months | n=82 | 26% (17%-36%)

12-months | n=38 | 42% (26%-59%) 

†Recurrence-free rate is defined as the percentage of patients that are recurrence-free at the given assessment time point.
*Response-evaluable population includes any mITT patient who completed the induction phase.
    Duration of Response: The median DoR for patients in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined (n=93) is 287 days (95% CI, 154-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis of pooled data for all patients with CIS (Cohorts 1 and 2, n=93) shows that among patients who achieved a complete response at 3 months, 52% remained disease-free for a total of 12 months or longer after starting treatment, using the Kaplan-Meier method. DoR is defined as the time from first occurrence of complete response to documentation of treatment failure or death.
    We have conducted additional analyses for secondary endpoints based on the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date. These additional preliminary data include the following:
•Time to Cystectomy: Across all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial, greater than 75% of all patients are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional ad hoc analysis shows that approximately 88% of responders are estimated to remain cystectomy-free at 3 years. Time to cystectomy is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to surgical bladder removal. The first 2018 FDA guidance on treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC patients states that the goal of therapy in such patients is to avoid cystectomy. Therefore, time to cystectomy is a key secondary endpoint in the VISTA Trial. 
•Time to Disease Recurrence: High-grade papillary (Ta or T1) NMIBC is associated with high rates of progression and recurrence. The median time to disease recurrence for patients in Cohort 3 (n=40) is 402 days (95% CI, 170-NE), using the Kaplan-Meier method. Time to disease recurrence is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of treatment failure or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation. 
•Progression-Free Survival ("PFS"): 90% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain progression-free for 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression (e.g., T2 or more advanced disease) or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation.
•Event-Free Survival: 29% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to remain event-free at 12 months, using the Kaplan-Meier method. Event-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease recurrence, progression or death on or prior to treatment discontinuation.
•Overall Survival ("OS"): 96% of all 133 patients treated with Vicineum in the VISTA Trial are estimated to have an overall survival of 2 years or greater, using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death from any cause.
Preliminary Safety Results
As of the May 29, 2019 data cutoff date, in patients across all cohorts (n=133) of our Phase 3 VISTA Trial of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, 88% experienced at least one adverse event, with 95% of adverse events being Grade 1 or 2. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysuria (14%), hematuria (13%) and urinary tract infection (12%) - all of which are consistent with the profile of bladder cancer patients and the use of catheterization for treatment delivery. These adverse events were determined by the clinical investigators to be manageable and reversible, and only four patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Serious adverse events, regardless of treatment attribution, were reported in 14% of patients. There were four treatment-related serious adverse events reported in three patients including acute kidney injury (Grade 3), pyrexia (Grade 2), cholestatic hepatitis (Grade 4) and renal failure (Grade 5). There were no age-related increases in adverse events observed in the VISTA Trial.
Other Development
In June 2017, we entered into a CRADA with the National Cancer Institute ("NCI") for the development of Vicineum in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab for the treatment of NMIBC. Under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological correlates of Vicineum in combination with durvalumab. This Phase 1 clinical trial is open and actively recruiting patients.
Commercial Partnering
Greater China
On July 30, 2020, we entered into the Qilu License Agreement pursuant to which we granted Qilu an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by us, to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum for the treatment of NMIBC and other types of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan ("Greater China"). We also granted Qilu a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing sublicense, under certain other intellectual property licensed by us to develop, manufacture and commercialize Vicineum™ in Greater China. We retain (i) development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world excluding Greater China and MENA and (ii) manufacturing rights with respect to Vicineum in the rest of the world excluding Greater China.
We have received a total of $10 million in net proceeds associated with the $12 million upfront payment due pursuant to the Qilu License Agreement. We are also entitled to receive up to an additional $23 million upon the achievement of certain technology transfer, development and regulatory milestones, as well as a 12% royalty based upon annual net sales of Vicineum in Greater China. The royalties are payable upon the first commercial sale of Vicineum in a region and continuing until the latest of (i) twelve years after the first commercial sale of Vicineum in such region, (ii) the expiration of the last valid patent claim covering or claiming the composition of matter, method of treatment, or method of manufacture of such Vicineum in such region, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory or data exclusivity for such Vicineum in such region. The royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances, including when there is no valid claim of a licensed patent that covers Vicineum in a particular region or no data or regulatory exclusivity of Vicineum in a particular region. 
MENA
On November 30, 2020, we entered into the Hikma License Agreement pursuant to which we granted Hikma an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, under certain intellectual property owned or exclusively licensed by the Company, to commercialize Vicineum in the MENA region. We retain development and commercialization rights in the rest of the world excluding Greater China and MENA. In consideration for the rights granted by us, Hikma agreed to pay to us an upfront payment, which would be subject to certain tax withholdings, and subject to delivery by us of certain documentation. In addition, Hikma agreed to pay milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, as well as a royalty based upon annual net sales in the MENA region. 
Vicineum for the Treatment of SCCHN
Vicineum (formerly referred to as Proxinium in publications, focused on this clinical setting), is also being developed as a treatment for patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN who have received at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. To treat SCCHN, Vicineum is administered via injection directly into the targeted tumor, or intratumoral injection. Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA and Fast Track designation from the FDA.
In our two Phase 1 clinical trials encompassing 44 patients treated with Vicineum, a complete resolution or reduction in size of injected tumors was observed in 16 of the 30 evaluable patients (53%) with EpCAM-expressing tumors as assessed by the investigators’ clinical measurements, the investigators' overall assessment including qualitative changes and assessment of available radiologic data. An additional 27% of evaluable patients had stable disease and, therefore, the results indicate an overall tumor control rate of approximately 80%.. In addition, three out of the four patients with CRs of injected tumors had regression or complete resolution of adjacent non-injected lesions. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, we observed tumor shrinkage in 10 of the 14 evaluable patients (71.4%). Vicineum was generally well-tolerated during the clinical trials. Dose-limiting toxicity in the Phase 1 clinical trials was transaminase elevation in liver enzymes.
In our clinical trials involving Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN, we also observed some stabilization, partial reduction and complete resolution of non-injected tumors. We believe that TFPT mediated killing of cancer cells occurs via a mechanism known as ICD, which is known to enhance the presentation of neoantigens to the immune system. We believe that this, combined with the immunogenic nature of our cytotoxic protein payload creates a heightened immune response, wherein naive cytotoxic T-cells are stimulated by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, presenting tumor cell surface antigens following the death of cancer cells. We believe that this anti-tumor response may complement checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial that will explore the potential of Vicineum in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of SCCHN and are actively seeking partners for a combination program. We anticipate that the Phase 1/2a clinical trial will explore the potential for Vicineum, due to its potential immunogenic effect, to enhance checkpoint inhibitors in combination therapy for the treatment of SCCHN. We will be measuring both the objective response rates and immune response biomarkers in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial. Should a trial yield encouraging results and we are able to secure additional funding, we will move into later stage trials.
During a Type C meeting with FDA in 2007, the FDA noted that approval of a companion diagnostic for EpCAM expression would need to coincide with Vicineum approval for the treatment of SCCHN. During the clinical evaluation of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN, we developed an immunohistochemical test to determine whether clinical trial patients are EpCAM-positive. Internal examination from head and neck cancer patients showed that our EpCAM antibody bound to 84% of all patient tumor samples we assessed. We intend to seek the FDA’s input as to whether this immunohistochemical test satisfies the FDA’s request for a companion diagnostic for EpCAM expression in this indication and whether we will need to submit this test for pre-market approval as a companion diagnostic in conjunction with Vicineum.
Overall, we believe that our efficacy and safety data support the continued clinical development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN to fulfill a significant unmet medical need in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN.
We believe Vicineum tumor cell killing mediates ICD of cancer cells leading to the release of tumor-specific neoantigens and recruitment/activation of cells of the host immune system. Further, Vicineum contains ETA, an immunogenic cytotoxic payload. The local activation of an anti-ETA response may further heighten the local immune response. We also believe that the effect of checkpoint inhibitors may be enhanced if they are used in combination with Vicineum due to its potential immunogenic effect.
We have deferred further development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development and, if approved, the commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We are also exploring collaborations for the development of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN intellectual property portfolio that provide an unextended patent term until 2036. See ‘‘Our Intellectual Property’’ below for additional details.
VB6-845d
Our lead systemically-administered product candidate, VB6-845d, is being developed as a treatment for multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors. VB6-845d is a TFPT consisting of an EpCAM targeting Fab genetically linked to deBouganin, which is administered by intravenous infusion. EpCAM is over-expressed on the cell surface of many solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovarian and prostate. EpCAM overexpression has been shown to be involved in promoting malignant progression. In addition, EpCAM overexpression is associated with increased tumor grade, disease progression, increased proliferative phenotypes and diminished survival. EpCAM is also a cancer stem cell marker. A Phase 1 clinical trial conducted with VB6-845, the prior version of VB6-845d, revealed no clinically relevant immune response to the deBouganin payload. Five of seven patients (71.4%) maintained stable disease (meaning no change in tumor size from baseline) after one completed cycle of treatment (four weeks). Two patients had decreases in target tumor size, and one subject who continued treatment through a third cycle (12 weeks) maintained stable disease. Interim safety data from our Phase 1 clinical trial was consistent with expectations for the study population of patients with advanced solid tumors and the anticipated effects of targeted biological therapies containing immunogenic sequences.
Based upon the hypersensitivity reactions seen in our Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Russia and in the country of Georgia, we de-immunized the Fab portion of VB6-845 to create VB6-845d. In April 2016, we submitted an IND to the FDA in preparation of initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VB6-845d in patients with EpCAM-positive cancers in the United States. The IND was withdrawn in July 2016 after we received initial feedback from the FDA indicating that they had identified hold and non-hold deficiencies that needed to be addressed. In December 2016, we submitted a request for a pre-IND meeting to seek input on the manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical plans for VB6-845d prior to resubmitting an IND. In February 2017, the FDA provided guidance on our manufacturing and nonclinical plans for VB6-845d. Based on this guidance, we intend to perform additional studies and submit an updated IND once funding or a partner is secured for this program.
Overall, we believe that our pre-clinical data and the interim Phase 1 clinical data support further clinical investigation of VB6-845d to explore whether it may fulfill the significant unmet medical need in the treatment of patients with EpCAM-positive solid tumors. Specifically, we believe that VB6-845d has potential to be a first-in-class TFPT capable of providing clinical benefit in these difficult to treat patient populations.
We are currently developing VB6-845d, a recombinant fusion protein consisting of an anti-EpCAM fragment fused to a deBouganin payload for the systemic treatment of advanced solid tumors. DeBouganin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis and helps circumvent multi-drug resistance mechanisms. Solid tumors form an abnormal and discrete tumor mass in the body that usually does not contain cysts or liquid areas.
We believe that our TFPTs utilizing our de-immunized deBouganin payload may be enhanced if combined with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that deBouganin’s potential effect on cancer cells could promote an immunogenic response that may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors.
We have deferred further development of VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development and, if approved, commercialization of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. We are also exploring collaborations for VB6-845d.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our VB6-845d intellectual property portfolio that provides for an unextended patent term until at least June 2025 and, method of treatment patents and applications for VB6-845d are granted, until at least 2036. See ‘‘Our Intellectual Property’’ below for additional details.
LUMC
On December 8, 2020, the Company and Leiden University Medical Center (“LUMC”) agreed to the co-development of an imaging agent (the “Imaging Agent”) that is comprised of an antibody fragment of Vicineum™, and an imaging molecule supplied by LUMC. The Imaging Agent is designed to delineate tumor from normal tissue during surgery so that the tumor margin is clearly visible, thereby helping to ensure clear margins after surgical excision of cancerous tissue. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of the Imaging Agent was successfully completed by LUMC with favorable tolerability and demonstrated tumor detection, which we believe further supports the targeting specificity of Vicineum. We signed an agreement with LUMC whereby we have an option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to any intellectual property related to the Imaging Agent. Additionally, the Company and LUMC have agreed to negotiate terms for the next clinical trial, which would begin after the anticipated U.S. approval of Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.
EBI-031 - Out-License Agreement with Roche
    In June 2016, we entered into the Roche License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive, worldwide license, including the right to sublicense, to the Licensed Intellectual Property. Under the Roche License Agreement, Roche is required to continue developing, at its cost, EBI-031 and any other product made from the Licensed Intellectual Property that contains a Licensed Product and pursue ongoing patent prosecution, at its cost. At the time of the Roche License 
Agreement, EBI-031, which was derived using our previous AMP-Rx platform, was in pre-clinical development as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema and uveitis. 
Financial Terms
    We received from Roche an upfront license fee of $7.5 million in August 2016 upon the effectiveness of the Roche License Agreement following approval by our stockholders, and Roche agreed to pay up to an additional $262.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones with respect to up to two unrelated indications. Specifically, an aggregate amount of up to $197.5 million is payable to us for the achievement of specified milestones with respect to the first indication, consisting of (i) $72.5 million in development milestones, the first of which is $20.0 million for initiation of the first Phase II study, (ii) $50.0 million in regulatory milestones and (iii) $75.0 million in commercialization milestones. In September 2016, Roche paid us the first development milestone of $22.5 million as a result of the IND application for EBI-031 becoming effective on or before September 15, 2016. Additional amounts of up to $65.0 million are payable upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones in a second indication. 
    In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments in accordance with a tiered royalty rate scale, with rates ranging from 7.5% to 15% of net sales of potential future products containing EBI-031 and up to 50% of these rates for net sales of potential future products containing other IL-6 compounds, with each of the royalties subject to reduction under certain circumstances and to the buy-out options of Roche.
Buy-Out Options
    The Roche License Agreement provides for two “option periods” during which Roche may elect to make a one-time payment to us and, in turn, terminate its diligence, milestone and royalty payment obligations under the Roche License Agreement. Specifically, (i) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the first dosing ("Initiation") in the first Phase 2 study for a Licensed Product until the day before Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Licensed Product, in which case Roche is required to pay us $135.0 million within 30 days after Roche’s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, or (ii) Roche may exercise a buy-out option following the day after Initiation of the first Phase 3 study for a Licensed Product until the day before the acceptance for review by the FDA or other regulatory authority of a BLA or similar application for marketing approval for a Licensed Product in either the United States or in the E.U., in which case Roche is required to pay us, within 30 days after Roche’s exercise of such buy-out option and receipt of an invoice from us, $265.0 million, which amount would be reduced to $220.0 million if none of our patent rights containing a composition of matter claim covering any compound or Licensed Product has issued in the E.U. 
Termination
    Either we or Roche may each terminate the Roche License Agreement if the other party breaches any of its material obligations under the Roche License Agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified cure period. Roche may terminate the Roche License Agreement following effectiveness by providing advance written notice to us or by providing written notice if we are debarred, disqualified, suspended, excluded, or otherwise declared ineligible from certain federal or state agencies or programs. We may terminate the Roche License Agreement if, prior to the first filing of a BLA for a Licensed Product, there is a period of 12 months where Roche is not conducting sufficient development activities with respect to the products made from the Licensed Intellectual Property.
Clinical Development
    In July 2019, Roche reported that it started a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravitreal EBI-031 monotherapy in patients with diabetic macular edema. Further, Roche reported that once determined, an extended cohort will be dosed with the optimal dose of EBI-031 while another arm of the trial will test EBI-031 in combination with Lucentis (ranibizumab) following intravitreal administration in patients with diabetic macular edema.

Our Vicineum License Agreements
In-License Agreement with Zurich
Overview and Exclusivity
    The Zurich License Agreement grants us exclusive license rights, with the right to sublicense, to make, have made, use and sell under certain patents primarily directed to our targeting agent, including an EpCAM chimera and related immunoconjugates and methods of use and manufacture of the same. These patents cover some key aspects of our product candidate Vicineum.
    Under the terms of the Zurich License Agreement, we may be obligated to pay $0.5 million in milestone payments for the first product candidate that achieves applicable regulatory development milestones. Based on current clinical status, we anticipate that these milestones may be triggered by the regulatory development pathway of Vicineum. As part of the consideration, we will also be obligated to pay up to a 4% royalty on the net product sales for products covered by or manufactured using a method covered by a valid claim in the Zurich patent rights. Royalties owed to Zurich will be reduced if the total royalty rate owed by us to Zurich and any other third party is 10% or greater, provided that the royalty rate to Zurich may not be less than 2% of net sales. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the expiration or termination of the last of the Zurich patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of a product. There is no obligation to pay royalties in a country if there is no valid claim that covers the product or a method of manufacturing the product. Through December 31, 2020, aggregate license fees of $0.6 million have been accrued or paid to Zurich since the inception of the license agreement, which includes $0.3 million accrued as of December 31, 2020 related to achievement of a development milestone due to the submission of the Company's BLA application with the FDA in December 2020. 
Patent Rights
    We are responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights, at our sole expense, while Zurich is afforded reasonable opportunities to review and comment on such activities. If appropriate, we shall apply for an extension of the term of any licensed patent where available, for example, in at least the United States, Europe and Japan. In the event of any substantial infringement of the patent rights, we may request Zurich to take action to enforce the licensed patents against third parties. If the infringing activity is not abated within 90 days and Zurich has elected not to take legal action, we may bring suit in our own name (and in Zurich’s name, if necessary). Such action will be at our own expense and Zurich will have the opportunity to join at its own expense. Recoveries from any action shall generally belong to the party bringing the suit, but (a) in the event that we bring the action and an acceptable settlement or monetary damages are awarded, then Zurich will be reimbursed for any amount that would have been due to Zurich if the products sold by the infringer actually had been sold by us, or (b) in the event a joint legal action is brought, then the parties shall share the expense and recoveries shall be shared in proportion to the share of expense paid by the respective party. Each party is required to cooperate with the other in litigation proceedings at the expense of the party bringing the action.
Term and Termination
    The term of the Zurich License Agreement expires as of the expiration date of the last patent to expire within the Zurich patent rights. We are currently projecting an expiration date for the United States licensed patents in June 2025, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available on a jurisdictional basis. Zurich has the right to terminate the Zurich License Agreement if we breach any obligation of the agreement and fail to cure such breach within the applicable cure periods. We have the right to terminate the Zurich License Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving 90 days written notice to Zurich.
In-License Agreement with Micromet
Overview
    Micromet is now part of Amgen, Inc. The Micromet License Agreement grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products. These patents cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Under the terms of the Micromet License Agreement, an initial license fee of €0.45 million was paid to Micromet by Viventia prior to our acquisition of Viventia, and we may be obligated to pay up to €2.9 million in milestone payments for the first product candidate that achieves applicable development milestones. Based on current clinical status, we anticipate that certain of these milestones may be triggered by the Vicineum regulatory and commercial development pathway. We are also required to pay up to a 3.5% royalty on the net sales for products covered by the agreement, which includes Vicineum. The royalty rate owed to Micromet in a particular country will be reduced to 1.5% if there are no valid claims covering the product in that country. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim covering the product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. Finally, we are required to pay to Micromet an annual license maintenance fee of €50,000, which can be credited towards any royalty payment we owe to Micromet. Through December 31, 2020, aggregate license fees of €1.8 million have been paid to Micromet since the inception of the license agreement, and we owe an additional €0.7 million of license fees as of December 31, 2020 related to the submission of our BLA to the FDA in December 2020. We paid €50,000 in annual license maintenance fees during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Either party has the right to terminate the Micromet License Agreement if the other party fails to comply with any of its material obligations under the Micromet License Agreement and fails to cure such non-compliance within the applicable cure periods.
In-License Agreement with XOMA
Overview
    The XOMA License Agreement grants us non-exclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, to certain XOMA patent rights and know-how related to certain expression technology, including plasmids, expression strains, plasmid maps and production systems. These patents and related know-how cover some key aspects of Vicineum. Under the terms of the XOMA License Agreement, an initial access fee of $0.25 million was paid to XOMA by Viventia prior to our acquisition of Viventia, and we are required to pay up to $0.25 million in milestone payments for a product candidate that incorporates know-how under the license and achieves applicable clinical development milestones. Based on current clinical status, we anticipate that these milestones may be triggered by the Vicineum clinical development pathway. We are also required to pay a 2.5% royalty on the net sales for products incorporating XOMA’s technology, which includes Vicineum. We have the right to reduce the amount of royalties owed to XOMA on a country-by-country basis by the amount of royalties paid to other third parties, provided that the royalty rate to XOMA may not be less than 1.75% of net sales. In addition, the foregoing royalty rates are reduced by 50% with respect to products that are not covered by a valid patent claim in the country of sale. The obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim covering the product and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country.

    The term of the XOMA License Agreement expires as of the expiration of any royalty obligations under the License Agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the XOMA License Agreement if the other party fails to comply with any of its material obligations under the XOMA License Agreement and fails to cure such non-compliance within the applicable cure periods.
Commercialization Strategy 
According to 2020 American Cancer Society figures, bladder cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer in the United States, with an estimated 81,400 new cases of bladder cancer and an estimated 17,980 deaths from bladder cancer. There is a significant unmet need for patients with bladder cancer, with very few treatment options. Since BCG was approved for first line treatment of NMIBC in the 1980s, only two products have been approved for second line use: VALSTAR in 1998, and Keytruda in 2020. Approximately 1,500 Urologists are responsible for treating 75% of bladder cancer patients treated with first line BCG treatment.
If approved on the August 18, 2021 PDUFA review date, we plan on launching Vicineum upon approval, with promotion to physicians and patients beginning immediately after approval and commercial product supply anticipated to be available in Urology clinics by the fourth quarter of 2021. We intend to pursue commercialization strategies that maximize the value of Vicineum in the United States by partnering with a contract sales organization, which we expect will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest significant financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to the approval of Vicineum. Based on our market research, we believe Vicineum has an innovative profile with a high possibility that patients, healthcare professionals and payors will be advocates for its use for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, which we believe represents a significant commercial opportunity. We believe that we will be able to effectively communicate the differentiating characteristics and key attributes of Vicineum to patients, physicians and payors, with the goal of establishing favorable reimbursement as well as a favorable formulary status in targeted Urology practices. Additionally, we believe that our plans to partner with a contract sales organization should allow us to address the Urologists-initiated treatment market for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC in the United States in an efficient and effective way. 
Other than in Greater China and the MENA region, where we have out-licensed development and commercialization rights to Vicineum, we own exclusive, worldwide rights to Vicineum. We plan to continue our pre-commercialization activities to prepare for a potential commercial launch of Vicineum, subject to receiving marketing approval in the United States. Outside of the United States, we will continue to engage key commercialization partners with local expertise in targeted regions, who will be the marketing authorization holders, to commercialize Vicineum. 
Our Manufacturing
    We lease a 31,100 square foot manufacturing, laboratory, warehouse and office facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba. We have three 15-liter fermenters, one 30-liter fermenter, one 150-liter fermenter, one 500-liter fermenter and one 1,500-liter fermenter. Our classified fermentation suite and post-production processing capabilities were dedicated to producing our pre-clinical study and clinical trial batches of Vicineum. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicineum necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities at our facility in Winnipeg and have redirected our resources toward completing the technology transfer process necessary to outsource commercial scale drug supply manufacturing to third-party manufacturers in the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. 
Fujifilm and Baxter 
In October 2018, we entered into the Fujifilm MSA for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug substance production.
In April 2019, the first full, commercial-scale cGMP run was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing was completed and all Phase 3 release specifications were met, supporting Fujifilm’s ability to produce the bulk drug substance form of Vicineum for commercial purposes if we receive regulatory approval to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. 
In November 2019, we entered into the Baxter CSA for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug product production. 
In February 2020, manufacturing of the pre-process performance qualification ("pre-PPQ") cGMP batch was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing of the drug substance was completed and all quality acceptance criteria were met. 
In August 2020, we completed manufacturing of the drug substance PPQ batches at Fujifilm and in September 2020, we successfully completed the final of three drug product PPQ batches at Baxter. All of the completed drug substance PPQ batches and drug product PPQ batches met all quality acceptance criteria. 
In December 2020, we received and analyzed all of the analytical comparability test results from the drug substance and drug product PPQ batches. For analytical comparability, we conducted testing across four categories: release testing, biophysical characterization, forced degradation studies, and stability studies. This approach is in alignment with requirements of the FDA, the EMA and the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. The test results for product intended for commercial use were found to be highly comparable to the Company’s clinical supply of Vicineum. Based on these results, we are optimistic that the FDA will determine that the commercial supply of Vicineum is comparable to the clinical supply of Vicineum, and that no additional clinical trials are warranted. The comparability data from the PPQ campaigns for both drug substance and drug product were the final material components of our completed BLA, which was submitted to the FDA on December 18, 2020.
Qilu
In December 2020, we entered into the Qilu CMO Framework Agreement for Qilu to be a contract manufacturer for the global commercial supply of Vicineum. We believe that the technology transfer to Qilu for the manufacturing of Vicineum is on track to be completed in mid-2021. 
Our Competition
    The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid and significant technological change and has a strong emphasis on developing proprietary products. While we believe that our next generation TFPT platform, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations; specifically with companies, institutions and organizations that are actively researching and developing products that attach proprietary cell-killing payloads to antibodies for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Our competitors include, but are not limited to:
•NMIBC: Merck & Co., Inc. (Keytruda/pembrolizumab and BCG) (approved drugs), Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Valstar/valrubicin) (approved drug), FerGene Inc. (Adstiladrin/nadofaragene firadenovec (rAd-IFN/Syn3)), Medical Enterprises Ltd. (Synergo RITE plus mitomycin C), Aadi, LLC (ABI-009), ImmunityBio (Anktiva/N-803 in combination with BCG), CG Oncology. (CG0070), Theralase Technologies Inc. (TLD-1433 photodynamic compound), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Opdivo/nivolumab with or without BCG or BMS-986205), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Tecentriq/Atezolizumab), AstraZeneca (Imfinzi/durvalumab with or without BCG or External Beam Radiotherapy), Eli Lilly and Company (Gemcitabine) and Telormedix SA (Vesimune);
•SCCHN: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Opdivo/nivolumab) (approved drug), Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck (Erbitux, pembrolizumab) (approved drugs);
•Multiple types of solid tumors: Amgen Inc. (Panitumumab) (approved drug), Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Sorafenib) (approved drug), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck (Erbitux) (approved drug), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Bevacizumab) (approved drug), Genentech, Inc. (Bevacizumab, Erlotinib and Trastuzumab) (approved drugs), Pfizer, Inc. (Sunitinib) and Trion Research GmbH (Removab); and
•In addition to competition from alternative treatments, we may also face competition from products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, our product candidates. Biosimilar products are expected to become available over the coming years. Even if our product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive biosimilar products if any have been approved by then and insurers or other third-party payors may encourage or even require the use of lower priced biosimilar products. Even if our treatments receive market authorization, they may not be listed on the formularies of payors (public or private insurers) or reimbursed. This may impact the uptake of the drug as a treatment option for patients and/or the price at which the drug can be sold at. Further, if the drug is reimbursed it may be at a narrower indication than the full scope of market authorization.
    Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. These competitors are also active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Moreover, specialized biologics, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
    Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the drug design, effectiveness against multi-drug resistance mechanisms, efficacy, safety, price and convenience of our product candidates.
Government Regulation 
    As a clinical-stage biologics company, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other national, supranational, state, provincial and local regulatory agencies. We are also subject to extensive regulation by similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we operate. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA") and their implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, post-approval monitoring and reporting, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval to market our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope to that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the E.U. are addressed in a centralized way through the European Commission following the opinion of the EMA, but country-specific regulation in the individual European Union Member States ("E.U. Member States") remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance 
with appropriate supranational, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and we may not be successful in any given jurisdiction.
U.S. Government Regulation
    In the United States, drug products are regulated by the FDA under the FDCA and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the PHSA. Drug products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. A failure to comply with any applicable requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, including, among other things, the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board ("IRB") of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, or administrative, civil and/or criminal investigation, penalties or prosecution.
    In the United States, all of our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. Manufacturers of biologics may also be subject to state and local regulation.
    The steps required before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally include:
•completion of pre-clinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies, some in compliance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulations, and the Animal Welfare Act administered and enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture;
•submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
•approval by an IRB before each trial may be initiated at each clinical site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials under protocols submitted to the FDA and reviewed and approved by each IRB, conducted in accordance with federal regulations and current Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") to establish the safety, purity and potency of the biologic for each targeted indication;
•submission of a BLA to the FDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA.
Pre-clinical Studies
    Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including, as applicable, GLP and the Animal Welfare Act. The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA evaluates the IND to determine whether there is an adequate basis for starting the product candidate in initial clinical trials, and the IND must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced. Additional pre-clinical studies may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during this 30-day period the FDA does not raise any concerns or issues that must be addressed prior to the commencement of clinical trials or does not impose a clinical hold, the IND becomes effective 30 days following the FDA’s receipt of the IND and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical Trials
    Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation and must be conducted in compliance with (i) federal regulations, (ii) GCP standards, which set safeguards to protect the rights and health of patients and establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting results of clinical trials, and (iii) protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if any. Foreign studies conducted under an IND generally must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. The informed written consent of each study patient must be obtained before the patient may begin participation in the clinical trial. The study protocol, study plan, and informed consent forms for each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each clinical site, and the study must be conducted under the auspices of an IRB for each trial site. Investigators and IRBs must also comply with FDA regulations and guidelines, including those regarding oversight of study patient informed consent, complying with the study protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. 
    The clinical trial program for a product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of a product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted in healthy human subjects, but in some situations are conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. These clinical trials are generally designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetic ("PK") properties and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s PK properties and pharmacological effects may be obtained to inform and support the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80;
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to obtain initial evidence of effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication(s) in patients with the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to gather additional information on possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants; and
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product candidate has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate, although a single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain instances.
    The decision to suspend or terminate development of a product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, by an IRB, or by a company for various reasons and during any phase of clinical trials. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by a data safety monitoring board ("DSMB"), which is an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor to evaluate at designated points in time whether or not a trial may move forward and/or should be modified. These decisions are based on unblinded access to data from the ongoing trial and generally involve determinations regarding the benefit-risk ratio for study patients and the scientific integrity and validity of the clinical trial.
    In addition, there are requirements for the registration of certain clinical trials of product candidates on public registries, such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, and the submission of certain information pertaining to these trials, including clinical trial results, after trial completion.
    Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, a sponsor submits extensive information about the product candidate to the FDA in the form of a BLA to request marketing approval for the product candidate in specified indications.
Biologics License Applications
    In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. For example, in November 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document on developing new drugs and biologics for treating BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and finalized this guidance in February 2018. Our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC may have to meet the expectations set forth in this guidance document to obtain approval. 
    Under Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing an original BLA, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial, subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. The FDA has 60 days from receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to accept for filing any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, in which case the BLA will have to be updated and resubmitted. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months of filing and 90% of standard applications within 10 months of filing, but the FDA can and frequently does extend 
this review timeline to consider certain later-submitted information or information intended to clarify or supplement information provided in the initial submission. On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that it has accepted for filing our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. The FDA also granted Priority Review for the BLA and the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021.
The FDA may not complete its review or approve a BLA within these established goal review times. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA has indicated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured or the facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and distribution process and will not approve the product candidate unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain BLAs must include an assessment, generally based on clinical trial data, of the safety and effectiveness of the biological product in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at a company’s request or by its own initiative, including waivers for certain products not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. Products with orphan drug designation are exempt from these requirements for orphan-designated indications with no formal waiver process required.
    After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal is to review such resubmissions within two or six months of receipt, depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval of a resubmitted BLA. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include Medication Guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and also may include elements to assure safe use ("ETASU"). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the biologic. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the biologic’s safety, purity, or potency, which can be costly.
    Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplemental BLA before the change can be implemented. A supplemental BLA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing a supplemental BLA as it does in reviewing a new BLA.
    Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, new or modified government requirements, including from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development or affect our ability to maintain product approvals we have obtained.
Biosimilars and Market Exclusivity
    Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), the FDA can approve products that are biosimilar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. To be biosimilar, a biological product must be highly similar to an already-licensed FDA biological product, or reference product and can have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity and potency from the reference product. An interchangeable biosimilar product must meet additional standards for interchangeability and, if approved, may be substituted 
for the reference product. At this juncture, it is unclear whether any product biosimilar ‘‘interchangeable’’ by the FDA, in fact, will be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
    After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, a manufacturer may file an application for approval of a ‘‘biosimilar’’ version of the innovator product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA under the PHSA. The BPCIA also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA. Although the patents for the reference biologic may be challenged by the biosimilar applicant during that time period pursuant to the BPCIA statutory patent challenge framework, no biosimilar or interchangeable product will be licensed by the FDA until the end of the exclusivity period. The first biologic product candidate submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against any other determinations of interchangeability to the reference product for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the interchangeable biosimilar product, (ii) 18 months after approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the interchangeable biosimilar product applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the reference product’s patents, and (iv) 42 months after approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
    The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of generic drugs. The FDA has published several guidance documents providing direction on developing and obtaining approval of biosimilar product candidates. The guidance documents to date explain, among other things, that the FDA will approve a biosimilar product if there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. A determination of biosimilarity may be based upon: (1) analytical studies showing that the biological product is highly similar to, with no clinically meaningful differences from, the reference product, (2) animal studies, including toxicity assessments, and/or (3) a clinical trial or trials (including assessment of immunogenicity and PKs) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and for which licensure is sought for the biological product. The FDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to developing the data and information needed to support biosimilarity. At each step, the sponsor should evaluate the extent of residual uncertainty of biosimilarity that remains and incorporate the FDA’s advice for additional studies to address remaining uncertainty. To meet the higher standard for interchangeability the sponsor must demonstrate, in addition to biosimilarity, that the proposed biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result and, if administered more than once to any given patient, the safety risk and potential for diminished efficacy associated with switching between the proposed biological product and the reference product is not greater than continuing to use the reference product. A biological product that is determined to be interchangeable may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. In March 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA, and it has approved other biosimilar products since then. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, the approval of a biosimilar to one of our products could have a material impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products, if approved by the FDA.
    The ‘‘Purple Book,’’ first published by the FDA in September 2014, lists biological products, including any biosimilar and interchangeable biological products licensed by the FDA under the PHSA. The lists include the date a biological product was licensed under Section 351(a) of the PHSA and whether the FDA evaluated the biological product for reference product exclusivity under Section 351(k)(7) of the PHSA. The Purple Book will also enable a user to see whether a biological product licensed under Section 351(k) of the PHSA has been determined by the FDA to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference biological product. Biosimilar and interchangeable biological products licensed under Section 351(k) of the PHSA will be listed under the reference product to which biosimilarity or interchangeability was demonstrated.
Advertising and Promotion
    The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of biologics through standards and regulations for, among other things, direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A biologic cannot be promoted before it is approved. After approval, promotion of a biologic can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA.
    Healthcare providers are permitted, however, to prescribe products for unapproved uses (also known as ‘‘off-label’’ uses) – that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the product’s labeling – because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA restricts manufacturers’ communications regarding unapproved uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a product for an unapproved use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding unapproved uses under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements 
and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ"), or the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), as well as state authorities. Such enforcement action could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products.
Post-approval Regulation
    After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the product. In addition, as a holder of an approved BLA, a company would be required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products.
    The manufacturing of our product candidates is required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. Our product candidates were manufactured at our production plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicineum necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 VISTA Trial and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we ended our manufacturing activities at our facility in Winnipeg and have redirected our resources toward completing the technology transfer process necessary to outsource commercial scale drug supply manufacturing to third-party manufacturers in the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In October 2018, we entered into the Fujifilm MSA for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug substance production. In November 2019, we entered into the Baxter CSA for the manufacturing process and technology transfer of Vicineum drug product production. In April 2019, the first full, commercial-scale cGMP run was completed at Fujifilm. Full quality release testing was completed and all Phase 3 release specifications were met, supporting Fujifilm’s ability to produce the bulk drug substance form of Vicineum for commercial purposes if we receive regulatory approval to market Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. The FDA and certain state agencies periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP and other laws. 
    Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product or the manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions may include suspension of product manufacturing until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a ‘‘consent decree,’’ which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. Other potential consequences include interruption of production, issuance of warning letters or other enforcement letters, refusal to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, product seizure or detention, and injunctions or imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties.
    In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation, correction, and reporting of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third-party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
    Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, such as additional post-market clinical trials to assess new safety risks or distribution-related or other restrictions under a REMS.
Patent Term Extension
    Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. The provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act permit a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be 
submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for patent term extension for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
    Many other countries also provide for patent term extensions or similar extensions of patent protection for biologic products. For example, in Japan, it may be possible to extend the patent term for up to five years and in Europe, it may be possible to obtain a supplementary patent certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
    The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
European Union and other International Government Regulation
    In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the E.U., for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States where the clinical trial is conducted and to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
Marketing Authorization Application for Biologic Medicinal Products
    To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under E.U. regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application.
    In the E.U., a marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single country). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and certain biologic products and optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health.
    In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA which will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Based on the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission takes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization which permits the marketing of a product in all 27 E.U. Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association States - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Under the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA CHMP.
    For other countries outside of the E.U., such as the United Kingdom and countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCPs, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Advertising, Promotion and Compliance
    In the E.U., the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to E.U. laws and E.U. Member States’ national laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Other E.U. Member State national legislation may also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics ("SmPC"), as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. The SmPC forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal 
product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion and is prohibited in the E.U. The applicable laws at the E.U. level and in the individual E.U. Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the E.U. could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.
    During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These penalties could include the imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Orphan Drug Designation
    The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or a disease or condition that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the biologic would be recovered from sales in the United States.
    In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application for a biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the product sponsor is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet patient needs. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different disease or condition.
    In the E.U., medicinal products: (a) that are used to diagnose, treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the E.U.; or (b) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation in the E.U. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved by the European Commission before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once designated, Orphan medicinal product designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Moreover, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization, if the product continues to be designated as an orphan medicinal product upon grant of the marketing authorization. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. This period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years, at the end of the fifth year, if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
    Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval or marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
    Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA.
Expedited Programs in the United States and Other Jurisdictions
    In the United States, a product may be granted Fast Track designation if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. With Fast Track designation, the sponsor may be eligible for more frequent opportunities to obtain the FDA’s feedback, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This Rolling Review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. Even if a product receives Fast Track designation, 
the designation can be rescinded and provides no assurance that a product will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously than would otherwise have been the case, or that the product will be approved at all.
    FDA may designate a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if it finds that the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other product candidates or approved products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies, more frequent interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for Priority Review. We may apply for breakthrough therapy designation for some of our product candidates. However, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for designation.
    Accelerated approval under FDA regulations allows a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies to be approved on the basis of either an intermediate clinical endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for confirmatory clinical trials to be conducted with due diligence to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm clinical benefit and for all promotional materials to be submitted to the FDA for review prior to dissemination.
    The FDA may grant Priority Review designation to a product candidate, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from FDA filing, or eight months from the sponsor’s submission. Priority Review may be granted where a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to available therapy. If criteria are not met for Priority Review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from FDA filing or 12 months from sponsor submission. Priority Review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. On February 12, 2021, the FDA notified us that it has granted Priority Review for our BLA for Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and the anticipated target PDUFA date for a decision on the BLA is August 18, 2021.
    Under the Centralized Procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding ‘‘clock stops,’’ when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which should be justified and assessed on a case-by-case basis. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of CHMP is given within 150 days.
    Vicineum has received Fast Track and Priority Review designations from the FDA for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive and Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of SCCHN.
Healthcare Reform
    In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any partners, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any partners, may receive for any approved products.
In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Medicare Modernization Act") established the Medicare Part D program and generally authorized prescription drug plan sponsors to impose limits on the number of covered drugs under their plans in a therapeutic class. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we may receive for any of our product candidates, if approved. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also may revise reimbursement and implement coverage restrictions. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. 
    In addition, in March 2010, President Obama signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the "ACA") substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA has impacted existing government healthcare programs and has resulted in the development of new programs. For example, the ACA provides for Medicare payment for performance initiatives.    
    Among the ACA's provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
•an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biological products;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program ("MDRP") to 23.1% for innovator drugs and 13% for non-innovator drugs of the average manufacturer price ("AMP");
•a new methodology by which AMP is calculated and reported by manufacturers for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a new partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients ("Medicare Part D") coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D (subsequent legislation increased this amount to 70% effective as of January 1, 2019);
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act's 340B drug pricing program;
•new requirements to report to CMS annually specifying financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the ACA and its implementing regulations, including reporting any ‘‘payments or other transfers of value’’ made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;
•a new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•a mandatory non-deductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents;
•establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payments and service delivery models; and
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research
Certain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible. It is unclear how the ACA and its implementation, as well as efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the ACA, or portions thereof, will affect our business.
    In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021) unless Congress takes additional action. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
    Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates. For example, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule to implement a “Most Favored Nation” demonstration project to test Medicare Part B reimbursement of certain separately payable drugs and biologicals based on international reference prices. The rule has become subject to judicial challenges, and federal courts have enjoined the rule at this time. If the rule survives judicial scrutiny, the Most Favored Nation model will subject certain drugs or biologicals identified by CMS as having the highest annual Medicare Part B spending to an alternative payment methodology based on international reference prices, with the list of products to be updated annually to add more products and products not to be removed absent limited circumstances. There has also been legislation that would establish an international reference price-based Medicare Part B drug and biological payment methodology.
    It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
    Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a biologic may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the biologic. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the products approved by the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for a particular indication or if a product is included it may not be listed on the formulary for all the indications or it may be listed on a narrower basis than what is approved by the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
    In 2003, the United States Congress enacted legislation providing Medicare Part D, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing.
    Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Further, there are national, provincial and territorial formularies funded by government healthcare systems, in addition to formularies for private payors (private insurers) and hospitals or hospital groups. Listing on the formularies and price depend on evidence and submissions regarding the cost-benefit of the drug and comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies and is often subject to negotiations.
    In the E.U., once a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product the applicant is required to engage in pricing and reimbursement discussions and negotiate with a separate pricing authority in each of the E.U. Member States. The E.U. Member States governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of the E.U. Member States may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other E.U. Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products but monitor and control company profits. The 
downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly pharmaceuticals, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Furthermore, many E.U. Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. The E.U. Member States have discretion to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. We may face competition for our products, if approved, from lower priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
    Health Technology Assessment ("HTA") of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some E.U. Member States. These E.U. Member States include France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in European Economic Area ("EEA") countries is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
    The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual E.U. Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between E.U. Member States.
    The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
    Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") Value Assessment for Cancer Treatments
    On May 31, 2016, ASCO published a framework to assess the value of cancer treatment options. The framework was developed in response to concern that new, expensive cancer treatments may not be supported by adequate medical evidence. The purpose of the framework is to provide a standardized quantification of cancer treatments and assist oncologists and patients in deciding between new cancer treatments and the standard of care. The framework takes into account a medication’s (i) efficacy, (ii) safety and (iii) cost, to derive an overall treatment value. 
    While we believe that the safety and efficacy profiles of our product candidates are potentially better than that of the standard of care and, if approved, we intend to price our products competitively, we do not know how the data will be assessed by ASCO. It is also unknown whether use of this application could adversely affect the assessment of any of our product candidates. If this framework were adopted and utilized by payors and physicians, and if Vicineum for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC were to receive low ratings, this could adversely affect the price and reimbursement of Vicineum, if approved, reduce prescriptions and harm our business. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
    Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by United States federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have described below some of the key federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate.
    The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if 
they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. In November 2020, HHS finalized a previously abandoned proposal to amend the discount safe harbor regulation of the Anti-Kickback Statute in a purported effort to create incentives to manufacturers to lower their list prices, and to lower federal program beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. The rule, which is currently slated to take full effect January 1, 2023, revises the Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor to exclude manufacturer rebates to Medicare Part D plans, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), creates a new safe harbor for point-of-sale price reductions that are set in advance and are available to the beneficiary at the point-of-sale, and creates a new safe harbor for service fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs for services rendered to the manufacturer. It is too early to know whether the Biden Administration will further delay, rewrite, or allow the rule to go into effect, and what effect the rule might may have on negotiations for coverage for products with Medicare Part D plans or commercial insurers. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. Liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
    The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and for allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, a claim can be deemed to be false due to failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements material to the government’s payment decision. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false claim or statement. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes.
    The fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, "HIPAA"), among other things, impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
    The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives.
    Many states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual healthcare providers; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing. Some states prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain healthcare providers, and/or offering co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, in order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. 
    In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. 
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. 
HIPAA imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. 
Other jurisdictions have corresponding laws and regulations governing the handling of personal information and third-party communications that may be more or less stringent than those of the United States. 
    In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual United States Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
    If we participate in the MDRP, we will have certain price reporting obligations to the MDRP, and we may have obligations to report average sales price ("ASP") figures to the Medicare program. Under the MDRP, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds available for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates would be based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data would include AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that modified MDRP regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value based purchasing arrangements (beginning in 2022); provide definitions of “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions (beginning in 2022); and revise best price and AMP exclusions of manufacturer-sponsored patient benefit programs, specifically regarding inapplicability of such exclusions in the context of pharmacy benefit manager “accumulator” programs (beginning in 2023). 
    Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the MDRP report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. 
    Federal law requires that any company that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Health Resources and Services Administration ("HRSA"), which administers the 340B program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement, pursuant to which manufacturers must report the 340B ceiling prices for their covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis. HRSA then publishes those prices to 340B covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution (“ADR”) process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. 
    In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its “covered drugs” (biologics or innovator drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies - Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory federal ceiling price. The 
requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
    Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount for each covered outpatient drug is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer’s submission to CMS of its current AMP and, in the case of innovator products, best price figures, for the quarter. If we participate in the MDRP and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the MDRP. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B program, and we may be obligated to issue refunds to covered entities. 
    If we participate in the MDRP or our products are covered under Medicare Part B, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. We cannot assure you that our submissions, if we participate in these programs, will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Civil monetary penalties also can be applied if we are found to have intentionally charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize. 
    Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including (depending on the applicable law) criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private ‘‘qui tam’’ actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and more extensive reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
    In the E.U., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual E.U. Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the E.U. Member States and by the United Kingdom's Bribery Act 2010. 
    The national laws of certain E.U. Member States require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed. Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations ("EFPIA") Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals. In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual E.U. Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual E.U. Member States.
    If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Environmental and Safety laws
    We are subject to a variety of federal, provincial and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations involve such hazardous materials and produce such hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, provincial and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. Radioactive materials in Canada come under federal jurisdiction. Canada’s Nuclear Safety and Control Act 1997 c.9 contains a general prohibition against any activity, including possession of radioactive material, except in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in a federal license issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulation does however, exempt licensing requirements for small quantities of radioactive substances that either meet concentrations set out in a schedule to the Regulation or, for radioactive substances not set out in the schedule, that meet certain regulatory criteria. Our operations do not currently require a federal license issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Our operations in Canada may be subject to license approvals, notification requirements and investigation and enforcement for air and water and waste matters.
Corporate History and Acquisition of Viventia
    We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2008. We were formerly known as Denovo Therapeutics, Inc. and Newco LS14, Inc. before changing our name to Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. in February 2010 and again to Sesen Bio, Inc. in May 2018. 
    In September 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Viventia, the shareholders of Viventia named therein (collectively, the "Selling Shareholders") and, solely in its capacity as seller representative, Clairmark, an affiliate of Leslie L. Dan, one of our former directors, pursuant to which we agreed to and simultaneously completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Viventia from the Selling Shareholders (the "Viventia Acquisition"). In connection with the closing of the Viventia Acquisition, we issued 4.0 million shares of our common stock to the Selling Shareholders according to their pro rata share of Viventia’s then-outstanding shares of common stock, which represented approximately 19.9% of our voting power as of immediately prior to the issuance of such shares of common stock.
    In connection with the Viventia Acquisition, we are obligated to pay to the Selling Shareholders certain post-closing contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified milestones and based upon net sales, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the acquisition agreement, including: (i) a one-time milestone payment of $12.5 million payable upon the first sale of Vicineum (referred to herein as the "Purchased Product"), in the United States; (ii) a one-time milestone payment of $7.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in any one of certain specified European countries; (iii) a one-time milestone payment of $3.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in Japan; and (iv) and quarterly earn-out payments equal to two percent (2%) of net sales of the Purchased Product during specified earn-out periods. Such earn-out payments are payable with respect to net sales in a country beginning on the date of the first sale in such country and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2033 and (ii) fifteen years after the date of such sale, subject to early termination in certain circumstances if a biosimilar product is on the market in the applicable country. 
    Under the Share Purchase Agreement, we, our affiliates, licensees and subcontractors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, for the first seven years following the closing of the Viventia Acquisition, to achieve marketing authorizations throughout the world and, during the applicable earn-out period, to commercialize the Purchased Product in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Japan, China and Canada.
Human Capital
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. There are a limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense given the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies looking for similar personnel as well as universities and research institutions. We rely on our executive officers and other key employees to achieve our research, development and commercialization objectives and to successfully implement our business strategy. We also rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. 
We are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace in which our employees from all backgrounds can fully contribute to the growth and success of our business. We communicate shared values and leadership behaviors, which are expected of all employees. Additionally, every employee has an annual performance review and has opportunities to contribute to corporate goals. We rely on a variety of sources to fill open positions, including job boards and postings on the our company website.
We have a demonstrated history of investing in our workforce through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health and employee wellbeing. We have adopted the Company’s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ("2014 Plan") and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to enable us and our subsidiaries to recruit and retain highly qualified employees, directors and consultants, provide those individuals with an incentive for productivity, and provide those individuals with an opportunity to share in our growth and value.
    As of December 31, 2020, we had twenty-seven full-time employees and no part-time employees, eight hold Ph.D. degrees and one is a veterinary doctor. This number consists of eleven employees engaged in administration, five employees engaged in clinical and regulatory activities, five employees engaged in research and development, four employees engaged in operations (two in manufacturing and two in facility/engineering) and two employees engaged in quality and support. Three of our employees are located in our corporate headquarters in Boston, thirteen of our employees are located in our Winnipeg facility, and eleven of our employees are located in our Philadelphia office. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. 
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 30% of our employees have continued to work at our Winnipeg facility, where we have adopted health screening, implemented socially distancing and personal protective equipment requirements, enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols, and modified workspaces to reduce the potential for transmission of the virus. All other employees who do not require access to our facility to perform their work have been working from home during the pandemic.
