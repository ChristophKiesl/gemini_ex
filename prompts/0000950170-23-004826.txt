 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 
Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. is an internally-managed net-lease REIT with in-house functions including acquisitions, credit research, asset management, portfolio management, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting. We invest primarily in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate assets throughout the United States, which are subsequently leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to high quality tenants with operations in retail, industrial and certain other industries. As a REIT, we are required to, among other things, annually distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders. We achieve this objective through consistent quarterly dividends supported by the cash flows generated by our leasing operations, which we look to continue to grow over time.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned a highly diversified portfolio of 2,115 properties operated by 351 tenants and with in-place Annualized Base Rent of $680.9 million. See Item 2. "Properties" for further information on our portfolio diversification.
 Shares of our common stock are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “SRC.”
 Business and Growth Strategies
 
Funding the heart of America’s business

 
Our objective is to maximize stockholder value by providing a growing stream of earnings and dividends generated by high quality, diversified commercial real estate. We seek to accomplish this objective by utilizing our proprietary tools and underwriting expertise to invest in and manage a high-quality portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the United States, which generally consists of free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities essential to the generation of their sales and profits. We then generate revenue primarily by leasing these properties to tenants we believe possess attractive credit characteristics and operate in stable or growing industries. Our leases are typically structured as triple-net leases, whereby the tenant is responsible for all improvements and is contractually obligated to pay all property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs.


STRONG OPERATING SYSTEMS

 Spirit utilizes integrated tools that streamline key processes for acquisitions, portfolio management, tenant monitoring, capital funding, forecasting and record keeping. We believe the effective use of technology to inform decisions provides efficiency, depth and scalability to our processes, allowing us to seamlessly execute our objectives. To enhance our operating systems, we have developed several proprietary tools to minimize risk and maximize stockholder returns:
oSpirit Property Ranking Model. The Spirit Property Ranking Model is a core tool developed internally by Spirit that ranks every property across twelve criteria, with a higher weighting allocated to real estate characteristics: (i) real estate score based on the site’s location, access, visibility and overall desirability, (ii) building score to evaluate the quality of the structure for industrial assets, (iii) 5-mile population for retail properties or 15-mile population for industrial properties, (iv) remaining lease term, (v) 5-mile household income, (vi) pre-overhead unit coverage, (vii) pre-overhead master lease coverage, (viii) corporate coverage, (ix) U.S. State ranking, (x) rent escalation characteristics, (x) lease structure, (xii) tenant industry ranking and (xiii) replacement rent, assuming the property becomes vacant. We believe that the higher the overall score assigned to a property, the lower the risk of a residual loss. Through acquisitions, dispositions, lease renewals and re-lets, we seek to continually improve the weighted-average property ranking of our portfolio. 
 oThe Spirit Heat Map. The Spirit Heat Map is used to analyze tenant industries across Porter’s Five Forces and for potential causes of technological disruption. The data is then used to understand the competitive landscape, performance and outlook of each industry. The Spirit Heat Map is updated regularly to incorporate changes in business and market conditions, changes in technology and other trends. Using this tool, coupled with our intensive credit and real estate analysis, lease structuring and ongoing portfolio management, we seek to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by focusing our investments within industries that we believe will be healthy and viable prospectively and disposing of properties within industries that have less favorable outlooks.
 oSpirit Business Intelligence Tools. Our business intelligence tools capture and bring together critical information across Spirit’s databases, including property data (including property performance and data points used in the Spirit Property Ranking Model), industry data and tenant credit data, allowing the information to be efficiently analyzed. Spirit uses these tools to compare potential acquisitions and dispositions to the existing portfolio and quantify improvements in key metrics including industry concentration, tenant concentration, weighted-average lease term, weighted-average Spirit property ranking and credit metrics.
 
OUTSTANDING PEOPLE

 With less than 100 employees, we are "All One Team" – our growth and success depend on teamwork and the individual contribution of each and every person we employ. We believe attracting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees is critical to creating a culture of collaboration and mutual respect and delivering strong financial results. We strive to prioritize the well-being and development of our employees through the following:
oEmployee Compensation and Benefits. To attract and retain top talent, we provide attractive compensation, including stock awards for all employees. Spirit also aims to award our employees benefits that are in line with those of our peers and competitors, including the following: Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance; Pet Insurance; Flexible Spending Accounts (Health and Dependent); Life and AD&D Insurance; Paid Vacation; Maternity and Paternity Leave; Military Leave; Short and Long-Term Disability; 401(k) and Roth Savings Plans; Employee Assistance Program; Employee Discount Program; Bereavement Leave; and COVID-19 Leave.
 oWorkplace culture. We strive to foster a best-in-class workplace culture, where all employees are encouraged to “R.E.A.C.H. for the stars” by demonstrating our five core values: (i) value Relationships, (ii) pursue Excellence, (iii) Act with integrity, (iv) Choose optimism, and (v) Have fun. We actively seek employee feedback through surveys, and anonymous survey results are communicated to all employees, as well as to our Board of Directors, to provide transparency and with the goal of continuous improvement. We also acknowledge employee successes through recognition at monthly “Town Hall” meetings hosted by our CEO. 
 oEmployee wellness. We believe the physical and mental well-being of our employees is important to our business and overall success. We implemented a hybrid work policy, which allows our employees the benefits of both remote and in-person work environments and supports flexible work schedules to help meet employee needs. Our offices were designed with the goal of employee health and well-being in mind, with sit-stand desks, ergonomic chairs, healthy snack options, maximized natural light in all workspaces, designated creative and collaborative workspaces, and robust cleaning and sanitizing procedures. Further, we routinely sponsor employee wellness initiatives, including walking and weight-loss challenges.


oDiversity and inclusion. We seek to provide equal employment opportunities to all individuals and seek to cultivate an inclusive culture that respects and appreciates diversity of experience, ideas and opinions. Our Diversity and Inclusion Council is tasked with providing educational and social programming for all affinity groups, as well as directing support to charitable organizations working to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in society. Under the Diversity and Inclusion Council, we have a Women’s Leadership Council, which focuses on empowering our female employees in personal and professional growth, and a Young Professionals Committee, which focuses on developing our employees under the age of 35. Programming in 2022 included hosting a mandatory third-party administered Inclusion and Bias Workshop for all employees and a mandatory Inclusive Leader Series for people-managers, funding scholarships for three students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities, partnering with Project Destined (a real estate training program for scholars in underserved communities) to mentor college students in a real estate case study competition, holding monthly meetings for our women’s book club, hosting a third annual women’s "real talk" speaker event and sponsoring an outing to a Texas Ranger’s game for our young professionals. 
 oTalent development. We aim to develop our employees through numerous channels, including third-party administered programs, individual coaching for certain employees, Pryor Learning membership (an extensive online training platform), and tuition assistance and course reimbursement for career-enhancing education and licensure requirements. We also internally curate development opportunities, including learning sessions on business and leadership topics, formal and informal mentorships to provide critical developmental feedback and direct access for all employees to our executive team, including through monthly “Town Hall” meetings. Annual goals are set for every employee and formal feedback is provided semi-annually on those goals as well as our core competencies: communication, accountability, teamwork, and our core values. We look to promote from within, but when external hires are needed, we use a thorough hiring process which includes multiple levels of interviews, cultural surveys, and technical skill testing, when appropriate. 
 oSocial engagement. We firmly believe that regular social and team building events for our employees encourage relationship building and collaboration – which we believe are important for employee engagement and a high performing “All One Team” culture. Our Spirit One Committee (comprised of employees across all levels) develops company-wide social events throughout the year, which in 2022 included "Coffee Talks" (small group discussions of non-work topics), our Annual Crawfish Boil, company-sponsored kick-ball and sand volleyball teams, and a Family Fun Day at Main Event. Additionally, our departments host team building events throughout the year.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 89 employees, as compared to 84 employees as of December 31, 2021. None of these employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

DEFINED AND DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased 172 properties with a gross investment of $1.4 billion, invested $101.1 million in revenue producing capital expenditures and funded a $12.7 million loan receivable. During the same period, we sold 60 properties with a gross investment of $240.1 million. We believe a highly disciplined and selective approach to acquisitions, paired with prudent asset recycling, will allow us to meet our business objectives.
oSourcing acquisitions. We believe a multi-channel approach drives volume for high-quality acquisitions and we focus on building and growing partnerships with a diverse base of tenants, brokers and owners. Over time, our target is a balanced mix of opportunities sourced from direct relationships with existing tenants, direct relationships with new tenants and broker relationships. These channels are built through current relationships with key members of our acquisitions, asset management and executive teams, partner appreciation events, attendance at critical conferences and conventions and through reliable execution. 


oEvaluating acquisitions. Each opportunity is evaluated against our acquisition criteria which includes, but is not limited to: accretive capitalization rate, long-term lease containing rent escalations, favorable tenant industries based on our Spirit Heat Map, favorable ranking based on the Spirit Property Ranking Model, attractive tenant credit characteristics and overall portfolio diversification impact. We target tenants that are publicly listed and have over $100 million in revenues, as we believe those tenants generally possess attractive characteristics including continual access to capital, lower leverage, audited financial statements and governance scrutiny. Further, when evaluating sale-leaseback transactions, we select opportunities where the tenant’s planned use of proceeds is to provide funding to meet their growth objectives. While we consider the foregoing when making investments, we have made investments, and may make additional investments, that do not meet one or more of these criteria if we believe the opportunity is sufficiently attractive. Acquisition opportunities go through a rigorous evaluation process culminating in review and approval by our Investment Committee. The Investment Committee includes representation from the acquisitions, asset management, credit, legal and finance departments. 
 oEvaluating tenant credit. We believe extensive credit underwriting is vital to minimizing tenant financial risk and protecting stockholder value. Our credit department, which is independent from our acquisitions department, underwrites all acquisition, disposition and capital investment opportunities and monitors the financial health of our existing portfolio. We use our underwriting capabilities to identify tenants with attractive credit characteristics and stable operating histories and to dispose of tenants with weakening characteristics.
 oEvaluating dispositions. We believe one of the tenets of maintaining a high-quality portfolio is an active disposition program, which allows for continued portfolio shaping and risk mitigation for potential tenant credit issues or near-term expirations. We look to dispose of properties when we believe the funds can be accretively recycled into new properties or into properties with characteristics we believe are more attractive, including, but not limited to, better tenant industry based on our Spirit Heat Map or better real estate, lease terms and/or tenant credit based on our Spirit Property Ranking Model. 
 
HIGH-QUALITY PORTFOLIO

 We believe that portfolio diversification and leases with structures aligned with our business and growth strategies are the cornerstones to managing the inherent risk associated with investing in real estate. The following portfolio qualities help maintain the stability of our rental revenue and maximize our long-term return on our investments:
oHighly diverse portfolio. We seek to maintain a portfolio that (i) derives no more than 5.0% of its ABR from any single tenant, (ii) derives no more than 2.0% of its ABR from any single property, (iii) is leased to tenants operating in various industries aligned with our Spirit Heat Map and (iv) is located across the U.S. without significant geographic concentration. As of December 31, 2022, our largest tenant exposure equaled 4.0%, our largest single property exposure equaled 1.1%, our largest industry concentration equaled 7.8%, and our largest geographic concentration by state equaled 14.2%, in each case based on ABR. Additionally, we seek to increase our industrial asset type exposure, which has risen to 23.0% of ABR as of December 31, 2022. See Item 2. “Properties" for further information on our portfolio composition.
 oLeases for operationally essential real estate. We seek to own properties where our tenants operate their business and generate sales and profits, which makes the location fundamentally important to that business and thereby reduces the risk that a tenant would not renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy.
 oLeases with contractual rental growth. We seek leases that contain contractual provisions to increase rental revenue over the term of the lease. Approximately 91.0% of our ABR as of December 31, 2022 is subject to rent escalations which, generally, increase rent at specified dates by: (i) a fixed amount; or (ii) the lesser of (a) 1 to 2 times any increase in the CPI over a specified period or (b) a fixed percentage.
 oLeases with relatively long terms. We seek leases with relatively long terms, typically with non-cancellable initial terms of 10 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions. As of December 31, 2022, our weighted average remaining lease term based on ABR was 10.4 years. 
 oLeases with a master lease structure. Where appropriate, we seek master leases whereby we lease multiple properties to a tenant on an “all or none” basis. In this master lease structure, a tenant remits a single lease payment for the entire portfolio of leased properties, which hinders a tenant’s ability to unilaterally give up underperforming properties while maintaining its leasehold interest in well-performing properties. Approximately 44.6% of our ABR as of December 31, 2022 is subject to a master lease structure. 
 Since our inception, our occupancy has never fallen below 96.1%, despite the economic downturn of 2008 through 2010, and since the Spin-Off, our occupancy has never fallen below 99.2%, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the diversity and strength of our portfolio are key drivers for our sustained high occupancy levels.


FORTRESS BALANCE SHEET

 Our long-term financing strategy is to maintain a leverage profile that creates operational flexibility and generates superior risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We finance our operations and investments using a variety of methods, including available unrestricted cash balances, property operating revenue, proceeds from property dispositions, available borrowings under our credit facilities, common and preferred stock issuances, and debt securities issuances, including mortgage indebtedness and senior unsecured debt. We determine the amount of equity and debt financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating our cost of equity capital, terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity) and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk.
In October 2020, we renewed our shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became immediately effective upon filing and will expire in October 2023, unless renewed before. Under this shelf registration statement, we may offer shares of our common or preferred stock or debt securities in amounts, at prices, and on terms to be announced when, and if, such securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds from any such offerings, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement or other offering materials at the time of such offerings.
 oIssuance of common stock. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows the offering proceeds to be accretively invested into additional properties, to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facilities, or to repay outstanding debt at or before maturity.
 oIssuance of debt securities. We have issued senior unsecured debt securities and have obtained other senior unsecured debt at the Operating Partnership level. To the extent practicable, we expect to maintain a well-balanced debt profile with manageable and staggered maturities.
 oCash provided by dispositions. We expect to sell real estate investments from time-to-time, as part of our active portfolio shaping strategy or as a form of risk mitigation. 
 oCash provided by operations. In addition to cash provided by the issuance of common stock, debt securities and dispositions, we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our available revolving credit facilities and delayed-draw term loans.
 We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our acquisitions and operations going forward; however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital and credit markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
 We believe doing the right thing for our employees, community and tenants – drives long term value for our stockholders. By implementing ESG practices throughout the operation of our business, we hope to demonstrate our focus on being responsible and conscientious in everything we do. We aim to be socially responsible investors by making investment decisions that consider not only financial factors, but also the social and environmental impact of our tenants and properties.
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
 We adopted an Environmental Management System (EMS) to formalize our company policy of implementing sound environmental sustainability practices throughout the business, which can be accessed on our website at www.spiritrealty.com. As we invest predominantly in single-tenant real estate under triple-net leases, our tenants are generally responsible for maintaining the leased premises, including controlling their energy usage and implementation of environmentally sustainable practices at each location. While we do not maintain direct control over our assets, we partner with our tenants to define environmental opportunities. We currently work to manage and mitigate the environmental risk that may be associated with our net-lease properties by:
 •including green lease clauses in our form lease agreement, which we strive to incorporate in our new leases, where possible
 •obtaining a Phase I environmental site assessment as part of our acquisition process and requiring additional environmental testing, including Phase II environmental site assessments, if applicable 
 •requiring sellers to remediate known environmental issues, as needed, in compliance with applicable laws
 •maintaining comprehensive pollution insurance coverage for our properties
 •appropriately underwriting the financial health and responsibility record of our tenants that are engaged in potentially environmentally sensitive operations


We also have an employee-led Think Green Committee dedicated to helping Spirit make environmentally smart choices and organize environmentally-focused community service projects. Additionally, environmental sustainability practices at our headquarters include:
 •automatic lighting control systems
 •ENERGY STAR certified computers, monitors, copiers, conference room displays and printers
 •active recycling of materials such as aluminum, paper and plastic, and use of recycled paper where possible
 •substantial paper reduction and default double-sided printing
 •elimination of disposable cups
 •incorporation of "green" cleaning products
 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 We are committed to providing an inclusive and engaging work environment that generates long-term value for our employees and shareholders. We strive to provide a diverse and safe workplace that fosters the health, wellness, and development of our employees, which is detailed in "Business and Growth Strategies: Outstanding People" above.
We aim to be a good corporate citizen through charitable donations and by encouraging our employees to participate in volunteer activities. In addition to company-directed donations, we have an Employee Gift Matching Program, under which we match, up to a certain dollar amount per employee, employee contributions to eligible charitable organizations. During 2022, we donated over $166.0 thousand across 43 organizations.
We have implemented social and human capital management practices and policies throughout the operation of our business, which we have documented in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, DEI Policy, and Human Rights Policy, each of which can be accessed on our website at www.spiritrealty.com.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
 We aim to be honest, fair and forthright in all of our business activities. As such, we aim to implement and maintain corporate governance practices that promote transparency, alignment, accountability, and value to our stockholders. Corporate governance documents, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, can be accessed on our website at www.spiritrealty.com. Highlights of our governance principles and practices include:
 •eight of nine directors on our Board of Directors are independent, including the chairman
 •independent directors are elected annually by majority vote
 •Audit, Compensation and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees are made up of independent directors only 
 •Board of Directors hold regular executive sessions, including with management, internal and external auditors, and without the presence of the CEO
 •Compensation Committee utilizes an independent consultant to assist with executive team compensation
 •Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for ESG oversight and receives ESG-related updates from executives at least quarterly and on an as-needed basis
 In addition, we maintain a Whistleblower Policy and independent, 24-hour helpline for reporting illegal or improper conduct or ethical concerns anonymously and have a Disclosure Committee composed of members of management with established controls and procedures so that all required disclosures are timely and accurate.
 Competition
 We face competition for acquisitions from other real estate investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity funds and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment.


As a landlord, we compete in the multi-billion dollar commercial real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates and flexibility. Some of our competitors have greater economies of scale, have lower cost of capital, have access to more resources, and have greater name recognition than we do. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose our tenants or prospective tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our leases expire.
 Regulation
 GENERAL
 Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
 Pursuant to the ADA, our properties are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA, as well as a number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations, may require modifications to properties we currently own and any properties we purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Noncompliance with these laws or regulations could result in fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of costs to make modifications to attain compliance. Although our tenants are generally responsible for compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with such laws or regulations.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regulate releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near properties that contain or have contained storage tanks for petroleum products or that involve or involved the use of hazardous or toxic substances. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant may be required to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases, and may be held liable to a government entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with actual or threatened contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault, or whether or not the owner, operator or tenant knew of or caused the contamination. The liability may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties for their fair share toward these costs. In addition, strict environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions and water discharges. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations.
Environmental laws also govern ACM. Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building’s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations and we could be subject to lawsuits if personal injury from exposure to ACM occurs. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or other airborne contaminants. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. Further, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs.

Before completing an acquisition, our policy is to obtain environmental assessments carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments as set by ASTM International. These assessments generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant available federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope, however, if recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater samplings, other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Generally, our leases provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property during their period of tenancy. However, if environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environmental insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance and various other factors we deem relevant (i.e., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability, or refuses, to honor its indemnification obligations to us).
