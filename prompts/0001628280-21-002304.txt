ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (MIC) is a Delaware corporation formed on May 21, 2015. MIC’s predecessor, Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC, was formed on April 13, 2004. Except as otherwise specified, all references in this Form 10-K to “MIC”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation and its subsidiaries.
MIC Level Strategy 
In October 2019, along with actively managing our existing portfolio of businesses, our Board resolved to pursue strategic alternatives including potentially a sale of our Company or our operating businesses as a means of unlocking additional value for stockholders. In December 2020, we completed the sale of our International-Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT) business. Our remaining operating businesses include Atlantic Aviation and the businesses that comprise MIC Hawaii. 
The net proceeds from the sale of IMTT (IMTT Transaction) of $1.55 billion were or are expected to be used to: (i) pay a special dividend of $11.00 per share on January 8, 2021; (ii) settle capital gains taxes expected to be paid by April 2021; (iii) pay transaction costs; (iv) pay a disposition payment under the Disposition Agreement, dated October 30, 2019, to our Manager (Disposition Payment) in December 2020 (currently in escrow); and (v) retire holding company level debt. 
Our highest priority remains the unlocking of value for stockholders through a sale of the Company or sales of our remaining operating businesses on terms and in a timeframe that maximizes such value. We have not set a timetable for completing any transaction(s) and there can be no assurance that any transaction(s) will occur on favorable terms or at all.
While we are pursuing a sale or sales, or in the event we are unable to or choose not to sell, we intend to protect and enhance the value of our remaining operating businesses to the extent possible, given the constraints of current economic conditions and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, by effectively managing costs and allocating our available capital prudently. We expect to focus our capital allocation on meeting our contractual obligations to invest in our businesses, maintaining an appropriate level of debt relative to the cash generating capacity of our businesses, and preserving our financial and structural flexibility. We further intend to manage our businesses in a manner that safeguards the environment, protects the health and safety of our employees and customers, and acknowledges the broader responsibility of our businesses to the communities in which they operate. 
Subject to stockholder approval and if and when our Board determines it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, we may further enhance our strategic flexibility by reorganizing MIC from a regular corporation into a publicly traded limited liability company (LLC), taxed as a partnership. We may also elect to make the entity holding our MIC Hawaii businesses a direct subsidiary of the LLC resulting from the reorganization. If undertaken, together these initiatives are expected to provide flexibility to pursue the sale or sales of MIC’s remaining operating businesses in any sequence generally without altering the after tax net proceeds to shareholders on the sale of our Atlantic Aviation business. 
General
We currently own and operate businesses that provide products and services to corporations, government agencies, and individual customers in the United States (U.S.). Our operations are organized into three segments:
•Atlantic Aviation: a provider of fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring, and other services primarily to owners and operators of general aviation (GA) jet aircraft at 69 airports throughout the U.S.;
•MIC Hawaii: comprising an energy company that processes and distributes gas and provides related services (Hawaii Gas) and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii; and
•Corporate and Other: comprising a holding company headquartered in New York City, MIC Corporate, and a shared services center in Plano, Texas, MIC Global Services.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, IMTT was classified as a discontinued operation and eliminated as a reportable segment. All periods reported herein reflect this change. In December 2020, we completed the IMTT Transaction. 
Effective October 1, 2018, the Bayonne Energy Center (BEC) and substantially all of our portfolio of solar and wind power generation businesses were classified as discontinued operations and our Contracted Power segment was eliminated. All periods reported herein reflect this change. In September 2019, we completed the last of the sales of our solar and wind power generation businesses including our majority interest in a renewable power development business. A relationship with a third-party developer of renewable power facilities was reported as a component of Corporate and Other through the expiration of the relationship in July 2019.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Businesses
Our businesses, in general, are defined by a combination of the following characteristics:
•ownership or lease of long-lived, high-value physical assets that are difficult to replicate or substitute for;
•being platforms for the deployment of growth capital;
•having broadly consistent demand for their services over the longer term;
•benefiting from relatively high operational leverage, such that increases in top-line growth can generate larger increases in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA);
•the provision of basic, often essential services;
•having generally predictable maintenance capital expenditure requirements; and
•having generally favorable competitive positions, largely due to high barriers to entry, including:
◦high initial development and construction costs;
◦difficulty in obtaining suitable land on which to operate;
◦high costs of customer switching;
◦long-term concessions, leases, or customer contracts; and
◦lack of immediate, cost-effective alternatives for the services provided.
Our businesses may exhibit the above characteristics to different degrees and at different times. In addition to the benefits associated with these characteristics, net margins generated by our businesses tend to keep pace with historically normal rates of inflation. Additionally, the cost pass-through adjustments that are typically included in the pricing for our products and services, serve to insulate our businesses to a significant degree from the negative effects of commodity price fluctuations.
Our Manager
Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (our Manager) serves as the external manager of our Company. Together we are parties to a Management Services Agreement pursuant to which our Manager provides corporate headquarters functions and services to the Company. Our Manager is a member of the Macquarie Group, a diversified international provider of financial, advisory, and investment services. The Macquarie Group is headquartered in Sydney, Australia and is a global leader in the management of infrastructure investment vehicles on behalf of third-party investors and an advisor on the acquisition, disposition, and financing of infrastructure assets.
We pay our Manager a monthly base management fee of 1/12th of 1% of our equity market capitalization less any cash balances at the holding company. For this, in accordance with the Management Services Agreement, our Manager provides normal ongoing corporate headquarters functions such as executive management, facilities, technology, employee benefits and access to services including human resources, legal, finance, tax and accounting, among others. Our Manager is responsible for and oversees the management of our operating businesses, subject to the oversight and supervision of our Board. Our Manager compensates and has assigned, or seconded, to us our chief executive officer and chief financial officer on a full-time basis. It also compensates and seconds, or makes available, other personnel as required. MIC has no employees at the holding company level.
Our Manager may also earn a performance fee if our quarterly total return (capital appreciation plus dividends) is positive and exceeds the quarterly total return of a U.S. utilities index benchmark both in the quarter and cumulatively. If payable, the performance fee is equal to 20% of the difference between the benchmark return and the total return for our stockholders during the quarter. Per the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager currently reinvests any base management or performance fees in new primary shares of our Company. Our Manager may elect to receive either base management or performance fees, if any, in cash but may only change its election during a 20-trading day window following our earnings release. Any change would apply to fees to which it was entitled thereafter.
To facilitate our pursuit of strategic alternatives, on October 31, 2019, we announced that we entered into a Disposition Agreement (Disposition Agreement) with our Manager (see Exhibit 10.3 of this Form 10-K). Outside of this agreement, we have limited ability to terminate the Management Services Agreement. With this agreement, our Management Services Agreement with our Manager will terminate as to any businesses, or substantial portions thereof, that are sold and, in connection therewith, we will make payments to our Manager calculated in accordance with the Disposition Agreement. The Disposition Agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of the Management Services Agreement and (ii) the sixth anniversary, subject to extension under certain circumstances if a transaction is pending.

Our Businesses
Use of Non-GAAP measures
In addition to our results under U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures including EBITDA excluding non-cash items and Free Cash Flow to assess the performance and prospects of our businesses. 
We measure EBITDA excluding non-cash items as it reflects our businesses’ ability to effectively manage the amount of products sold or services provided, the operating margin earned on those transactions, and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses.
In analyzing the financial performance of our businesses, we focus primarily on cash generation and Free Cash Flow in particular. We believe investors use Free Cash Flow to assess our ability to fund acquisitions, invest in growth projects, reduce or repay indebtedness, and/or return capital to shareholders. 
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Consolidated — Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) excluding non-cash items and Free Cash Flow” for further information on our calculation of EBITDA excluding non-cash items and Free Cash Flow and for reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.
Atlantic Aviation 
Industry Overview
Fixed based operations (FBOs) primarily service the GA segment of the air transportation industry. Local airport authorities own the airport properties and grant FBO operators a long-term ground lease that includes the right to provide fueling and other services. Fueling services provide the majority of an FBO’s revenue and gross margin.
FBOs often operate in environments with high barriers to entry. Airports tend to have limited physical space for additional FBOs and airport authorities generally do not have an incentive to add FBOs unless there is a significant demand for services that cannot be met by the existing FBO at the airport. Development of a new FBO requires securing airport approvals, completing the design and construction of the FBO, and may involve substantial time and capital. Furthermore, airports typically impose minimum standards with respect to the experience, capital investment, and breadth of services provided by the FBO.
The ownership of FBOs in the U.S. is highly fragmented with most being individually owned and operated. Consolidation has been and is expected to continue to be an important feature of the industry as larger networks, such as our Atlantic Aviation business, are able to achieve economies of scale in fuel and insurance purchasing, marketing, and back office operations compared with individual owners/operators.
Demand for FBO services is driven broadly by economic activity and the level of GA flight activity, the latter defined as the number of take-offs and landings per period. We believe that over the long-term, GA flight activity will continue to expand at rates broadly consistent with overall economic activity in the U.S.
Business Overview
Atlantic Aviation operates FBOs at 69 airports in the U.S that provide fuel, terminal, aircraft hangaring, and other services primarily to owners/operators of GA aircraft, but also to certain commercial, military, freight, and government aviation customers.
Atlantic Aviation has been a part of the MIC portfolio since our IPO. On December 31, 2004, the business owned and operated a total of 16 FBOs. Through a roll-up of FBOs, net of dispositions, we have increased the size of the network to the present 69 facilities. Since our IPO, we have deployed capital in Atlantic Aviation in the acquisition of FBOs and projects including the construction of terminals and aircraft hangars, fuel tank farms, aircraft parking (ramps), and a range of smaller projects.

Operations
Atlantic Aviation operates high-quality facilities and focuses on attracting customers who desire personalized service. Fuel sales historically have been approximately 60% of gross margin while hangar rentals constituted approximately 15% to 20% of gross margin. Other services, including de-icing, aircraft parking, aircraft cleaning, and catering provided the balance. Fuel is stored in tank farms owned either by Atlantic Aviation or by the airport and Atlantic Aviation operates owned or leased refueling vehicles to move fuel from the tank farms to the aircraft being serviced. At some of Atlantic Aviation’s locations, services are also provided to commercial airlines, freight operators, and military and government users. Services provided to the airlines may include refueling from the airline’s own fuel supplies, de-icing, and/or ground and ramp handling services.
Atlantic Aviation buys fuel at a wholesale price and sells fuel to customers either at a contracted price, or at a price negotiated at the point of purchase. While wholesale fuel prices can vary, Atlantic Aviation generally passes any changes through to customers and seeks to maintain and, when possible, increase its dollar-based margin per gallon. In general, the business has minimal exposure to commodity price fluctuations due to the pricing structure for fuel sales and as it carries limited inventory.
Atlantic Aviation continuously evaluates opportunities to reduce costs. Such opportunities may include business reengineering, more efficient purchasing, partnering with service providers, and/or capturing synergies in acquisitions. 
Locations
Atlantic Aviation’s FBOs operate pursuant to long-term leases from the airport authorities who own or manage the airport. Atlantic Aviation works with these airport authorities to optimize lease lengths through capital improvements or other enhancements to the airport.
Atlantic Aviation’s EBITDA-weighted average remaining lease length (including leases extendable at Atlantic Aviation’s sole discretion) was 22.0 years and 19.0 years on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The leases at seven of Atlantic Aviation’s FBOs, collectively accounting for approximately 12% of Atlantic Aviation’s gross margin, are expected to be renegotiated and extended within the next five years. No individual FBO generated more than 10% of Atlantic Aviation’s gross margin in 2020. 
Airport authorities have certain termination rights in each of Atlantic Aviation’s FBO leases. These rights allow for termination if Atlantic Aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of the lease, abandons the property, or becomes insolvent or bankrupt. Many of the leases allow for termination if liens are filed against the property. Leases related to fewer than twenty airports may be terminated for convenience. Generally, termination provisions in Atlantic Aviation's airport leases contain compensation agreements based on good faith negotiation, amortization schedules, or obligations of the airport authority to make best efforts to relocate the FBO. 
Atlantic Aviation periodically evaluates its portfolio of FBOs and occasionally concludes that some of its sites do not have scale or do not serve a market with sufficiently strong growth prospects to warrant continued operations at these locations. In these cases, it may elect to sell the site or not renew the lease upon maturity.
Marketing
Atlantic Aviation's marketing programs utilize data derived from a proprietary point-of-sale system. The system supports activity tracking and provides customer relationship management data that facilitates the optimization of services provided to each customer. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Atlantic Aviation — (continued)

Atlantic Aviation also maintains a loyalty program for pilots, Atlantic Awards, that provides an incentive to purchase fuel from Atlantic Aviation. Awards are recorded as a reduction in revenue in Atlantic Aviation’s consolidated financial statements.
Competition
Atlantic Aviation competes with other FBO operators at more than half of its locations, and its facilities may also face indirect competition from FBOs located at nearby airports. FBOs compete based on the location of the facility relative to runways and street access, quality of customer service, safety, reliability, value-added features, and price. Each FBO also faces competitive pressure resulting from the fact that aircraft may take on enough fuel at one location and not need to refuel at a specific destination.
Atlantic Aviation’s main competitors are Signature Aviation, Jet Aviation, Million Air (network of franchisees), Sheltair Aviation, TAC Air, and Ross Aviation. To our knowledge, other than Signature Aviation, no competitor operated more than 25 FBOs in the U.S. on December 31, 2020.
Customers
Atlantic Aviation's customers include individual owner/operators of GA jet aircraft, corporate flight departments, charter operators, and managers of fractional ownership programs. The business does not depend on a single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. 
Regulation
The FBO industry is overseen primarily by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In addition, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, state and local environmental agencies, and local airport authorities contribute to the regulation of FBOs. The business must comply with federal, state, and local environmental statutes, and regulations associated in part with the operation of fuel storage tank systems and fuel trucks. These requirements include tank and pipe testing for tightness, soil sampling for evidence of leaking, and remediation of detected leaks and spills.
Atlantic Aviation’s FBOs are subject to regular inspection by local environmental agencies as well as local fire marshals and other agencies. The business does not expect that compliance and related remediation work, if any, will have a material negative impact on earnings or the competitive position of Atlantic Aviation. The business has not received notice requiring it to cease operations at any location or of any abatement proceeding by any government agency for failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the business employed 1,763 people, of which 170 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees at Atlantic Aviation are generally good.
The day-to-day operations of Atlantic Aviation are managed by individual site managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their site. Atlantic Aviation’s operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the aviation industry.
MIC Hawaii 
Industry Overview
According to the Energy Information Administration, energy consumption in Hawaii is split approximately equally between the transportation market and the industrial/commercial/residential markets. Gas has an approximately 2% share of the Hawaii energy market and serves primarily the industrial/commercial/residential markets with applications including water heating, commercial laundry service, cooking, emergency power generation, and other select uses.
Beginning with the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative in 2008, the State of Hawaii embarked on a program to be a leader in the development and deployment of clean energy solutions. MIC Hawaii has invested in a number of clean energy projects including a renewable natural gas facility that captures and purifies wastewater biogas for injection into the Hawaii Gas utility pipeline on Oahu. MIC Hawaii is pursuing additional growth opportunities in support of Hawaii’s clean energy goals.
Business Overview
MIC Hawaii comprises Hawaii Gas and several smaller businesses collectively engaged in efforts to reduce the cost and improve the reliability and sustainability of energy in Hawaii. From 2006 to 2015, our MIC Hawaii segment consisted solely of Hawaii Gas, a combination of Hawaii’s only government-franchised gas utility and an unregulated liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) business. Founded in 1904, Hawaii Gas serves the State’s approximately 1.4 million residents and approximately 2.7 million and 10.4 million visitors in 2020 and 2019, respectively, across Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and Lanai (the main islands). Visitor arrivals for 2020 were substantially lower than in prior years due to limitations on travel imposed in

response to the outbreak of COVID-19. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Consolidated — Impact of COVID-19” for further discussions. 
Hawaii Gas’ utility business includes the processing, distribution, and sale of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and renewable natural gas (RNG) and the distribution and sale of regasified liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the island of Oahu, as well as the distribution and sale of LPG via pipeline on all of the main islands. Hawaii Gas’ unregulated business distributes LPG by truck to individual tanks located on customer sites or distributes LPG in cylinders filled at central locations to customers on all the main islands. Customers include a wide variety of industrial, commercial, residential, hospitality, military, public sector, and wholesale users.
Hawaii Gas’ primary products consist of:
Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG): The business converts a light hydrocarbon feedstock (naphtha) into SNG, predominantly comprised of methane and hydrogen, having a similar heating value to natural gas. Hawaii Gas operates the only SNG processing capability in Hawaii at its plant located on the island of Oahu. SNG is delivered by underground pipelines to utility customers throughout Oahu.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): LNG is transported to Hawaii in conventional intermodal cryogenic containers from the U.S. mainland. Hawaii Gas is authorized to substitute up to 30% of its SNG production with LNG to supply customers of the regulated utility on Oahu. 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG): LPG is a generic name for a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, typically propane and butane. LPG liquefies at a relatively low pressure under normal temperature conditions and can be efficiently transported in various quantities. LPG is typically stored in cylinders or tanks and Hawaii Gas maintains the largest network of LPG storage in Hawaii. Industrial/commercial/residential applications of LPG are similar to those of natural gas and SNG. 
Renewable Natural Gas (RNG): Hawaii Gas collects, purifies, and injects biogas from the Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant into the utility pipeline distribution system on Oahu. The business is evaluating a range of additional renewable natural gas sources including other wastewater treatment plants, landfills, and locally produced biomass.

Customers
The businesses of MIC Hawaii provide services to industrial/commercial/residential and government customers. MIC Hawaii does not depend on any single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business.
Regulation
Hawaii Gas’ utility business is regulated by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (HPUC). The HPUC exercises broad regulatory oversight and investigative authority over all public utilities in Hawaii.
Rate Regulation. The HPUC establishes the rates that Hawaii Gas can charge its utility customers via cost of service regulation. Although the HPUC sets the base rate for the gas sold by Hawaii Gas’ utility business, Hawaii Gas is permitted to pass through changes in its fuel (feedstock) costs by means of a monthly fuel adjustment charge.
Hawaii Gas’ utility rates are established by the HPUC in periodic rate cases typically initiated by Hawaii Gas. The business initiates a rate case by submitting a request to the HPUC for an increase in rates based upon, for example, increased costs related to providing services. Following initiation of the rate increase request and submissions by other intervening parties of their positions on the rate request, and potentially an evidentiary hearing, the HPUC issues a decision establishing the revenue requirements and the resulting rates that Hawaii Gas will be allowed to charge.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
MIC Hawaii - (continued)

Other Regulations. In addition to regulating utility rates, the HPUC acts on requests for the acquisition, the sale, disposition, or other exchange of utility properties, including mergers and consolidations, acts on requests for financings and approves material supply contracts. 
Hawaii Gas' operations are also regulated by agencies including the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, Hawaii Department of Health, and state and local environmental agencies. 
Competition
Depending upon the end-use, Hawaii Gas competes with electric generators as well as other gas providers, diesel, and other alternative energy sources. Electricity in Hawaii is generated by four electric utilities and various independent power producers. In addition, residential, and some commercial customers in Hawaii have increased the rate at which they are installing solar photovoltaic generating capacity.
Hawaii Gas’ Utility Business. Hawaii Gas holds the only government franchise for utility gas services in Hawaii. This enables Hawaii Gas to utilize public easements for its pipeline distribution systems. This franchise also provides for the exclusive use of extensive below-ground distribution infrastructure that Hawaii Gas owns and maintains. Hawaii Gas competes based on price, reliability, and the energy preferences of its customers.
Hawaii Gas’ Non-Utility Business. Hawaii Gas sells LPG in an unregulated market on the main islands of Hawaii. There are several other wholesale and smaller retail distributors that compete in the LPG market. Hawaii Gas believes it has a competitive advantage because of its established customer base, substantial storage facilities, distribution network, and reputation for reliable service.
Fuel Supply, SNG Plant, and Distribution System
Fuel Supply
Hawaii Gas sources naphtha feedstock for its SNG plant from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC pursuant to a contract that expired in December 2020. A new naphtha feedstock agreement that expires in December 2023 was negotiated in September 2020 and submitted to the HPUC for approval in October 2020. In December 2020, the HPUC issued an Interim Decision and Order approving the new naphtha feedstock agreement subject to further review and findings. 
The majority of Hawaii Gas’ LPG is purchased from an off-island supplier pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2024. Hawaii Gas sources LNG from a U.S. mainland supplier pursuant to a contract that expires in July 2021. RNG is purchased from the City and County of Honolulu under a fixed rate contract that expires in December 2024.
SNG Plant and Distribution System (Utility Business)
Hawaii Gas processes and distributes SNG from a plant located on the west side of Oahu. A 22-mile transmission pipeline links the SNG plant to a distribution system consisting of approximately 900 miles of distribution and service pipelines transports gas to customers. On islands other than Oahu, LPG is distributed by direct deliveries from an off-island shipper and by barge from Oahu to holding facilities or baseyards on those islands. It is then distributed via pipelines to utility customers. Approximately 90% of the Hawaii Gas pipeline system is on Oahu.
Distribution System (Non-Utility Business)
The non-utility business of Hawaii Gas provides LPG to customers that are not connected to Hawaii Gas’ utility pipeline system on each of the main islands. The majority of Hawaii Gas’ non-utility customers are on islands other than Oahu. LPG is transported to these islands by direct deliveries from an off-island shipper and by barge from Oahu. Hawaii Gas also owns the infrastructure by which it distributes LPG to its customers, including harbor pipelines, trucks, several holding facilities, and storage baseyards on Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii.
Environmental Permits
The businesses of MIC Hawaii require environmental operating permits, the most significant of which are air and wastewater permits required for the Hawaii Gas SNG plant.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, MIC Hawaii had 345 employees, of which 216 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with both union and non-union employees at MIC Hawaii are generally good. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Corporate and Other
Our Corporate and Other segment comprises primarily MIC Corporate and our shared services center, MIC Global Services. The financial results for MIC Corporate reflect the costs associated with operating as a public company. These include primarily the fees paid in connection with the evaluation of various investment and acquisition/disposition opportunities, fees paid to the New York Stock Exchange, fees paid to our external auditors and advisors, and the cost of Director’s and Officer’s insurance. Other corporate headquarters costs including the salaries, benefits, and incentives paid to individuals seconded to MIC, together with the cost of our facilities, technology, and services provided to the holding company by our Manager, are included in the Fees to Manager — related party line item
MIC Global Services provides common administrative functions including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration, information technology, procurement, tax, legal, and certain finance and accounting functions to the businesses in our portfolio, including certain transitional services in connection with the IMTT Transaction. A portion of the costs associated with the operation of the shared services center are allocated to our operating companies. Any unallocated shared services costs are reported as a component of our Corporate and Other segment. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, Corporate and Other had 116 employees at the shared services center. MIC Corporate has no employees as our Manager employs and seconds those individuals who serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer on a full-time basis and makes other personnel available as required. 
Consolidated
Human Capital Management 
As of December 31, 2020, our businesses employed approximately 2,200 people. We believe that these employees drive our businesses’ success, and supporting these employees is a foundational value of the Company. 
Business ethics. Our continued success relies on the preservation of our good reputation. Our Code of Business Conduct sets forth our commitment to safe, ethical, and legally compliant business practices, and outlines the values by which all employees are expected to be guided. 
Health and safety. We and our operating businesses promote a “zero harm” culture. The workplace health and safety performance of each business is reported regularly to our board of directors. Our businesses have implemented comprehensive safety training programs for employees and regularly review and enhance safety protocols. In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our businesses implemented pandemic response plans including remote working where possible and deployment of personal protective equipment and provided continuous communication to employees regarding steps they could take to protect themselves. To the extent permitted/possible, our operating businesses are facilitating the vaccination of their employees against COVID-19.
Compensation and benefits. Our businesses offer market competitive compensation programs in order to attract and retain superior talent, including bonus opportunities, health and welfare benefits, wellness initiatives, time-off, employee assistance programs, and opportunities to give back to our communities through donations of time and money. 
Culture and inclusion. Our businesses are equal opportunity employers, and we are committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and empowered workforce. Each of our operating businesses, with the participation and support of holding company level staff, have established Diversity and Inclusion committees. These committees have been responsible for, among other things, conducting surveys of their respective employee groups on issues of diversity and inclusion and educating employees at all levels about the importance of having an employee and management team that reflect the composition of the communities they serve.
Labor relations. Approximately 17% of our businesses’ employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2020. We consider our relationship with employees to be good.
