The agreement is active as of the date of this report.
 
Industry Background
 
Brand advertisers and consumer product companies utilize a broad array of consumer data on which to base advertising decisions. They have traditionally relied upon information collected from legacy media distribution providers to base their research (e.g., Comcast and other cable providers). These traditional methods are inherently inefficient by today’s standards and are often cost-prohibitive due to their fragmented nature, relying upon separate, non-integrated legacy providers for television and music research related to consumer preferences.
 
Digital surveying methods provide a solution to many of the inefficiencies present with traditional methods. Thus, advertisers, agencies, entertainment studios and others are rapidly adopting digital methodologies to augment their traditional practices. One such digital surveying method yet to be widely implemented is Over-the-Top (“OTT”) measurement, which the Company believes is a significant market opportunity.

In today’s digital world, consumers have access to media, television shows, music, movies, video games and software through a number of growing and fragmented methods and providers. This change in behavior and habits is an evolution resulting from technological innovation, and has resulted in greater choice and democratization amongst consumers. The resulting digital empowerment has directly lead to the birth of platforms providing consumers direct access to media, which often times circumvents legacy providers previously relied upon for distribution (such as traditional cable providers).
 
One of the more prominent digital platforms to arise has been Over-the-Top (e.g., Popcorn Time, Netflix, Hulu, HBOGO). Over-the-Top broadcast is entertainment content (e.g., audio, video, and other media) transmitted via the Internet without an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems controlling or distributing the content (i.e., cable television service providers). Consumers can access Over-the-Top content through Internet-connected devices such as phones (including Android, iPhone, and Windows-type mobile devices), smart TVs (such as Google TV and LG Electronic's Channel Plus), set-top boxes (such as the Fire TV and Roku), gaming consoles (such as the PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox One), and desktop and laptop computers and tablets.
 
According to MarketsandMarkets, the Over-the-Top market is estimated to grow from USD 28.04 Billion in 2015 to USD 62.03 Billion by 2020 with a CAGR of 17.2%. Thus, because Over-the-Top is so widely used and being rapidly adopted for digital media consumption, demographic data related to its use can provide digital agencies and consumer product companies with a wide variety of critical and yet untapped information about consumers enabling them to target their messages and offerings to such consumers.

Marketing and Advertising Industry Implications
 
The Company believes data collected from Over-the-Top viewership and listenership represents a substantial improvement over search and other tracking data utilized to obtain marketing insights, as Over-the-Top data reflects actual consumption of media with respect to which the viewing party has taken an affirmative effort to obtain, as opposed to search data, such as Google, which can reflect pure curiosity.
 
Through rigorous testing and analysis, the Company has been able to show that on a general basis, the domestic Over-the-Top audiences most commonly reside in middle to upper-middle class households, possessing greater than average levels of discretionary income. The Company sees this demographic skew as a significant opportunity in the marketplace, as the Company’s prospective core client base, digital agencies and consumer product companies, proactively seek new audiences deemed financially worthy of sales and advertising efforts.
 
PeerLogix Over-The-top Opportunity
 
Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Adoption and Activity
 
Over-the-top media viewership represents up to 22% of all worldwide internet traffic and is used by approximately 765 million people worldwide to consume TV shows, movies, music, pictures, video games, e-books and software online. Representing 10.2% of the global population and 32.1% of digital video viewers worldwide, the global subscription OTT market will grow by 24.0% this year thanks to increasing internet penetration, faster speeds and a broader shift toward internet entertainment, according to eMarketer.
 
All major entertainment and media content are available to consumers tuning in via OTT media platforms – with the category representing one of the most significant percentages of global internet bandwidth. The Company measures, tracks and archives OTT viewership data of premium television shows and movies from approximately 170 million households and stores all such data in a fully scalable database which has been accumulating since approximately January 1, 2014, providing distinctive ability to provide trend analysis on the basis of worldwide entertainment viewing habits.
 
The Company’s proprietary platform operates on an automatic basis with little human interaction and continually acquires and catalogues data on OTT media activity in real time, obtaining millions of data points daily.

PeerLogix Platform 
 
The Company’s proprietary platform enables the tracking and cataloging of OTT media in order to determine consumer trends and preferences based upon media consumption. PeerLogix’s patented platform collects over-the-top data, including IP addresses of the uploading and downloading parties (e.g., location), the name, file type, media type (whether movie, television, documentary, music, e-books, software, etc.), and genre of media downloaded, and utilizes licensed and publicly available demographic and other databases to further filter the collected data to provide insights into consumer preferences to digital advertising firms, product and media companies, entertainment studios and others.
 
PeerLogix Application
 
Market
 
Understanding customer and target audience information is of the upmost importance for organizations undertaking media planning activities. As marketing becomes increasingly data-centric, the ability to obtain rich insights about consumers’ media preferences is expected to represent a significant competitive advantage for the Company’s clients.
 
According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the big data technology and services market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.1% over the 2014-2019 forecast period with annual spending reaching $48.6 billion in 2019. This is the market targeted by the Company.
 
The Company’s platform consists of a Media Library with over 3 billion records of streaming activity and media downloads of entertainment programming (i.e., television shows, movies, etc.). The data is leverageable by clients of the Company to advertise to, and test assumptions about who their customers really are and the specific media (i.e., television shows, movies, etc.) those customers truly value through proprietary media pattern identification and tracking.
 
Services Offered
 
The services offered by the Company are two-fold:
 
1) Advertising services that provide marketers, publishers and networks custom digital audience segments that match specific advertiser criteria (e.g., specific sporting interests, television show, media genre, actor/actress, etc.). This enables media planners to buy qualified audiences directly and execute digital campaigns either through the client's ad server or an existing DSP or SSP relationship.
 
2) Data licensing services that provide networks, studios and content creators unfettered analysis of the Company’s OTT data. Macro-level viewership analysis of millions of households can increase licensing efficiency for both networks and studios by better understanding the popularity of specific med content (i.e., television shows and movies) in markets around the world.
 
Product Architecture
 
Architecture
 
The client-server cloud-based architecture provides several key advantages for the security, scalability and redundancy of the infrastructure.

Client Security

The Company’s application is a “thin client”, meaning all requests, proprietary data and algorithms reside on the server side. All communications between servers are through encrypted channels.
Server Scalability and Redundancy
 
All of the Company’s web services are hosted on the Amazon EC2 cloud, which is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. The Company’s current architecture allows it to further scale out (add more servers) and/or scale up (add more capacity to an existing server) within minutes, and its current architecture has been tested successfully under heavy stress tests. Additionally, the Company’s load balancers enable updates and maintenance without any downtime and all of its data is backed up and mirrored between two SQL servers (An SQL server is a Microsoft product used to manage and store information. The aforementioned data stored inside an SQL server will be housed in an archived database).
Server Security
 
The Company’s web services on Amazon EC2 have gone through a hardening process to enhance their security according to known practices, and all algorithms and data servers are isolated from the internet. Only requests originating from the Company’s Dashboard are delivered to its data servers, with all other connection requests ignored.
Proprietary Peer-to-Peer Monitoring System

The peer-to-peer protocol is a communications protocol that enables computers to share Media Files (e.g., TV shows, movies, music, video games and commercial software). Rather than making a single TCP connection (TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data), peer-to-peer enables a single user to download Media Files over many small data requests over different IP connections from a multitude of distributing computers simultaneously, resulting in quicker and more reliable download speeds for the user. A peer-to-peer client utilized by an individual coordinates Media File distribution by locating other computers in any geography of the world sharing part or the entirety of the contents of said Media File. To accomplish this series of actions, the peer-to-peer client running on the distributing/sharing individual’s computer breaks the Media File into a number of smaller but identically sized pieces. Pieces are typically downloaded non-sequentially by the peer-to-peer client on the downloading individual’s computer and are rearranged into the correct order by the peer-to-peer client on the downloading individual’s computer (see below). Typical Media File sharing architecture utilizing a peer-to-peer protocol (the Company’s technology is not depicted):

Search Scraper
 
The Company’s Search Scraper scans websites and message forums to find media files of major entertainment interests (e.g., television shows, movies, music and video games), extracts their web addresses, and subsequently downloads the location of the media files found into a MySQL database (MySQL is an open source relational database management system. Information in a MySQL database is stored in the form of related tables). This process mimics the behavior a person would undertake to obtain Over-the-Top media files on their own. The Company believes its proprietary search technology is capable of finding the vast majority of freely available Over-the-Top files in existence on the internet.
Accuracy & Geo-location
 
The Company incorporates a third-party geo-location service provided to determine authenticity of IP Addresses as well as their physical geographic location to an accuracy of a few hundred yards. IP Addresses deemed to be virtual private networks (VPNs) or using an alternative masking service are flagged, giving the Company the ability to filter them out during later analysis steps, if deemed necessary. Information the Company is able to directly conclude about Over-the-Top households as a result of their IP Address are: Country, Region/State, City, ZIP/Postal Code, Internet Connection Type & Speed, Mobile Carrier (if applicable), Latitude/Longitude (approximate), Internet Service Provider, Home/Business, and Company Name (if applicable).
Consumer Privacy
 
The Company’s data meets anonymity standards necessary to be classified as non-personally identifiable information (Non-PII), and all contributors have taken an affirmative effort to download, stream, participate in, or contribute to the respective Over-the-Top network containing media files of interest. As a result, the Company’s data collection methods meet or exceed the current accountability and data collection standards of domestic and many international government and regulatory agencies.
Market Positioning & Product Expansion
 
Worldwide Solution
 
The Company sees its large swath of international data as a significant competitive advantage compared to alternative data offerings. Its data is contributed to by individuals from the vast majority of countries in the world. As a result, the Company has the ability to offer clients information giving them a strategic advantage when entering new markets, such as understanding the cultural preferences of local populations, consequently better positioning products with locally preferred music artists, television or movie content.
Competitive Advantages
 
The Company, and the data it collects possess three significant competitive advantages to other data sources.
 

· | Scale – Over-the-Top audience data, and consequently each data point the Company collects, represent individuals from the vast majority of countries around the world. As a result, the Company is able to measure specific media preferences of populations in most countries, and is not limited to predefined major markets. Clients of the Company are able to gain significant competitive advantages understanding media preferences within new markets they choose to enter with their products (e.g., introducing a new consumer packaged good product into a select province of India or Indonesia).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Granularity – The Company’s tracking mechanisms are location agnostic, and its incorporated geo-location service is able to identify the physical location of viewers within the accuracy of a few hundred yards. As a result, the Company’s technology is able to determine media preferences on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood level (e.g., television preferences in Manhattan vs Brooklyn), providing clients first of its kind abilities previously unattainable with transactional data. 
· | Transactional Data – Each user and data record the Company collects in its database represents an affirmative action taken by an individual to obtain and watch/listen to the content. The Company believes that it is one of only a few organizations able to provide transactional media information on a worldwide basis, in every major and developing country.

Revenue Model
 
Revenue from Clients
 
The Company’s audience data is sold most frequently on a Cost Per Mile basis (“CPM”, i.e., the predetermined price of advertising sold, typically in units of 1000 ad impressions), with a revenue split between the Company and one or more channel partners. The Company offers various pricing modules to accommodate Agencies, Entertainment Studios, Trading Desks, and others. As with most usage-based services, the Company offers different pricing packages for ongoing support, such as custom advertising segments based on media affinities. Over time, the Company intends to apply optimization techniques to determine different pricing schemes. Revenues are invoiced on a per-client basis, and the Company is either engaged with, or is negotiating proposals with clients whom are now deemed recurring.
Foundational Marketing Efforts
 
Public Relations. The Company intends to generate both international and local media coverage for its services, through a variety of channels, including media articles and interviews with management. To date, we have been approached by representatives of several international media companies expressing interest in covering the Company’s developments through earned media, such as news announcements and content creation. The Company’s proactive efforts will be supported by local public relations agencies. It will attempt to focus its efforts on media channels and publications that target advertising and marketing issues, as well as small cap financial industry publications.
Online Marketing. The Company intends to utilize online campaigns that are designed to direct additional potential customers to its services. Rigorous social media profiles on top platforms will assist in bolstering the Company’s value proposition to the market; top platforms include: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Wikipedia.
 
The Company believes in utilizing Earned Media to bolster its value proposition to both client and investor markets. Core areas of concentration will include: publishing company news and industry news via distribution channels, including 1st party blogs and investor relations webpages; social media feeds, including: Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter; weekly and quarterly newsletters intended to provide proprietary value to companies in the industry (e.g., ADP Quarterly Jobs Report vs PeerLogix Quarterly Media Report).
 
Thought Leadership. Management intends to develop periodic thought leadership pieces on advertising data and the current and future state of media trends. By participating in industry events and conferences, the Company plans to position itself as a source of imminent and forthcoming insight for emerging trends in media and consumer data sciences. The Company intends to originate much of this messaging from events, both hosted by and participated in by the Company, to then continue the topics and conversation through aforementioned social media channels. These “Community Building” efforts are intended to organically build interest in the Company both in its industry and in the financial markets.
Acquisition Costs
 
Because the Company offers a software solution, its primary variables in respect to expenses are sales efforts, customer acquisition costs and customer churn.
 
Customer Acquisition Costs. 
 
The Company continually evaluates its customer acquisition costs with the intent of optimizing its marketing channels and marketing messages. The Company anticipates Investor and Public Relations costs to comprise a noteworthy percentage of its overall budget. Management intends to implement a broadly inclusive plan, with the intention of drawing a significant amount of attention to the Company’s value proposition for client industries, as well as the Company’s compelling investment thesis to the public markets. Specific efforts include, but are not limited to: public relations strategy, media relations, news announcements, content creation, thought leadership development and traditional and digital advertising. As the Company has experienced and continues to have insufficient working capital to effect its business plan, while it planned on allocating approximately $350,000 to customer acquisition, marketing, sales, public relations and investor relations efforts over an initial 12 month period, with further budgeting to be determined thereafter, to date the Company has allocated only approximately $120,000.

Customer Support
 
To ensure customer satisfaction, the Company’s customer support efforts include both proactive and responsive models.
 
Proactive 
 
The Company has developed an event-driven automatic system that notifies its support to errors faced by clients. Errors that could potentially be present in new releases of the Company’s platform are able to be detected by its support staff immediately after a client experiences them.
Responsive Model
 
The Company intends to offer online and telephone support for clients to support its products and services.
     Intellectual Property
 
The Company has filed a patent application, including a secondary continuation-in-part (CIP) patent, on its proprietary Over-the-Top tracking technology and business applications. On May 22, 2018 the Company was granted its first patent application (US20140289860A1). The Company’s CIP patent application was filed on March 19, 2014 and is currently pending.
 
In addition to the Company’s patent portfolio, the Company’s proprietary database contains 48 months of Over-the-Top media consumption that cannot be acquired or recreated by new market entrants, as Over-the-Top data is ephemeral and is therefore lost if not captured. By possessing this historical information, the Company is afforded the unique ability to analyze historical trends that a potential future competitor would not be capable of upon entrance to the market.
 
Competition 
 
The Company’s primary competitors are TruOptik, Muzit, Nielsen, Kantar (a subsidiary of WPP Group) and Rentrak. Secondary competitors include Google’s Trends products and Facebook’s suite of advertising tools. Most of these companies have significantly greater resources than the Company. Nielsen’s and Rentrak’s services are largely based on sampling methodologies with a small sample in each market used to measure television and movie viewing behaviors. These are the standards currently employed for the measurement of television and movie behavior for advertising purposes, referred to often times as the “sample currency.” Facebook’s and Google’s services are based on sampling of their users’ posts and search activity which is used to determine present and emerging curiosity of people who participate on their platforms. TruOptik and Muzit also employ a Over-the-Top sampling methodology, each respectively stating they track Over-the-Top users. TruOptik’s service is principally a Data Management Platform, built for advertisers, and Muzit focuses on providing services to music artists. It is unknown as to the extent or depth of either of their respective technology’s tracking and cataloguing capabilities.
 
The Company expects to enjoy a unique competitive position, derived from the scale, granularity and the transactional nature of its data. Its services and systems differ from a sampling service (e.g., Nielsen) in that the Company possesses a measurement system based on a massive amount of passively-collected viewing and listening activity. This results in far more granular, reliable and predictable determination of consumers’ actual preferences as compared to either a small, compensated sample approach (e.g., Nielsen) or search engine data which is merely an expression of interest and not listening or viewing intent.
 
Although the Company believes that it is currently able to compete effectively in the market, it may not be able to do so in the future or be capable of maintaining or further increasing its market share. A failure to compete successfully in its market could adversely affect its business and financial condition.
