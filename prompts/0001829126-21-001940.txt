ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
General Description of Business
 
Structure 
 
Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. (’‘Lightstone REIT III’’), is a Maryland corporation, formed on October 5, 2012, which elected to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015.
 
Lightstone REIT III is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2020, Lightstone REIT III held an approximately 99% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 
 
We have and will continue to seek to acquire a diverse portfolio of real estate assets and real estate-related investments, including hotels, other commercial and/or residential properties, primarily located in the United States. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. We may also originate or acquire mortgage loans secured by real estate. Although we expect that most of our investments will be of these types, we may make other investments. In fact, we may invest in whatever types of real estate-related investments that we believe are in our best interests.
 
We currently have one operating segment. As of December 31, 2020, we majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of eight limited service hotels containing a total of 872 rooms and an unconsolidated 50.0% membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the “Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture”). We account for our unconsolidated membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting.
 
Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2,000 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. Our Advisor also owns 20,000 shares of our common stock (“Common Shares”) which were issued on December 24, 2012 for $200,000, or $10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of the Lightstone Group, LLC. The Lightstone Group, LLC served as our sponsor (the ’’Sponsor’’) during our initial public offering (the “Offering”) which terminated on March 31, 2017. Mr. Lichtenstein owns 222,222 Common Shares which were issued on December 11, 2014 for $2.0 million, or $9.00 per share. Pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), the Advisor has primary responsibility for making investment decisions on our behalf and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Special Limited Partner”), which owns 242 subordinated participation interests (“Subordinated Participation Interests”) in the Operating Partnership which were acquired for $12.1 million in connection with our Offering. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership.

We do not have employees. The Advisor receives compensation and fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets.
 
Our Advisor has affiliated property managers (the “Property Managers”), which may manage certain of the properties we acquire. We also use other unaffiliated third-party property managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties.
 
Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our Common Shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any active market for our Common Shares until they are listed for trading. In the event we do not begin the process of achieving a liquidity event prior to March 31, 2025, which is the eighth anniversary of the termination of our Offering, our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio.
 
Noncontrolling Interests – Partners of the Operating Partnership
 
Limited Partner 
 
On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2,000 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert the limited partner units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our Common Shares.
Special Limited Partner
 
In connection with our Offering, which terminated on March 31, 2017, the Special Limited Partner purchased from the Operating Partnership an aggregate of approximately 242 Subordinated Participation Interests for consideration of $12.1 million. The Subordinated Participation Interests were each purchased for $50,000 in consideration and may be entitled to receive liquidation distributions upon the liquidation of Lightstone REIT III.
 
As the majority owner of the Special Limited Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99% interest in such Subordinated Participation Interests and will thus receive an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof.
 
These Subordinated Participation Interests entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that we make to our stockholders, but only after our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. From our inception through December 31, 2020, no distributions have been declared or paid on the Subordinated Participation Interests.
 
Operating Partnership Activity
 
Our Operating Partnership commenced its operations on December 11, 2014. Since then we have and will continue to seek to primarily acquire and operate hospitality properties and to a lesser extent, other commercial and residential properties principally in North America through our Operating Partnership. Our commercial holdings may consist of full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels and to a lesser extent, retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. In addition, we may invest up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly.
Related Parties
 
Our Advisor and its affiliates and the Special Limited Partner are related parties. Certain of these entities are entitled to compensation for services related to the investment, management and disposition of our assets during our acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during our acquisition and operational stages are based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements.
Primary Investment Objectives 

Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. We intend to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties.

Acquisition and Investment Policies 
 
We have and/or intend to continue to primarily acquire commercial properties (including full-service or select-service hotels and extended-stay hotels) and residential real estate assets, as well as other real estate-related investments principally in North America. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities including restaurants, concierge and room service, porter service or valet parking. Select-service hotels typically do not include these amenities. Extended-stay hotels offer upscale, high-quality, residential style lodging with a comprehensive package of guest services and amenities for extended-stay business and leisure travelers. We have no limitation as to the brand of franchise or license with which our hotels are associated. We generally intend to hold each acquired property for a period of three to six years although we may hold our properties for differing timelines depending on various factors.
 
Even though we have and intend to continue primarily to acquire hotels, we have and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We have and expect to invest mainly in direct real estate investments and other equity interests; however, we may also invest in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk.
 
We have and may continue to enter into joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties with third parties or certain affiliates of our Advisor, including other present and future REITs and real estate limited partnerships sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor.
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest or borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total “net assets” (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.
 
We do not currently intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.
 
Distributions on Common Shares 
 
On June 19, 2019, our Board of Directors determined to suspend regular monthly distributions.
 
Previously, distributions in an amount equal to a 6.0% annualized rate were declared on a monthly basis beginning on January 14, 2015 through June 30, 2019 and were paid on or about the 15th day following each month end.
 
There were no distributions declared during the year ended December 31, 2020. Total distributions declared during the year ended December 31, 2019 were $4.0 million.
 
Future distributions declared, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. Our Board of Directors will consider various factors in its determination, including but not limited to, the sources and availability of capital, revenues and other sources of income, operating and interest expenses and our ability to refinance near-term debt as well as the IRS’s annual distribution requirement that REITs distribute no less than 90% of their taxable income. We cannot assure that any future distributions will be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have previously established or may establish.

Share Repurchase Program 
 
Our share repurchase program may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their Common Shares back to us, subject to restrictions. For the period from January 1 through March 18, 2020, 80,436 shares of common stock were repurchased under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of $9.92 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 141,204 shares of common stock at an average price per share of $9.77.
 
On March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension of all redemptions effective immediately.
 
Tax Status
 
We elected to qualify and be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
 
We engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), including when we acquire a hotel we usually establish a TRS which then enters into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we may be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any. 
 
COVID-19 Pandemic Operations and Liquidity Update 
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic leading many countries, including the United States, particularly at the individual state level, to subsequently impose various degrees of restrictions and other measures, including, but not limited to, mandatory temporary closures, quarantine guidelines, limitations on travel, and “shelter in place” rules in an effort to reduce its duration and the severity of its spread. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve, most of these previously imposed restrictions and other measures have now been reduced and/or lifted. However, the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly unpredictable and dynamic and its duration and extent is likely dependent on numerous developments such as the regulatory approval, mass production, administration and ultimate effectiveness of vaccines, as well as the timeline to achieve a level of sufficient herd immunity amongst the general population. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have negative effects on the overall health of the U.S. economy for the foreseeable future. 
 
The extent to which our business may be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and future developments, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, room demand for our consolidated and unconsolidated hotels began to significantly decline in March 2020 and while there has been some slight improvement; room demand continues to be substantially below historical levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results to date and we currently expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We cannot currently estimate if and when room demand will fully recover to pre-pandemic levels for our hotels.
 
In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operating results of our hotels, we have taken various actions to preserve our liquidity, including, but not limited to, those described below:
 

● | We implemented cost reduction strategies for all of our hotels, leading to reductions in certain operating expenses and capital expenditures. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Amendments to Revolving Credit Facility – On June 2, 2020, our revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) was amended to provide for (i) the deferral of the six monthly debt service payments aggregating $0.8 million for the period from April 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020 until July 13, 2022; (ii) a 100 bps reduction in the interest rate spread to LIBOR + 2.15%, subject to a 3.00% floor, for the six-month period from September 1, 2020 through February 28, 2021; (iii) our pre-funding $0.8 million into a cash collateral reserve account to cover the six monthly debt service payments due from October 1, 2020 through March 1, 2021; and (iv) a waiver of all financial covenants for quarter-end periods before June 30, 2021. Additionally, a principal paydown of $0.6 million, which was previously due on April 1, 2020 was bifurcated into two separate principal paydowns, each one $0.3 million, which were made in June 2020 and September 2020. We and the lender have agreed in principle to certain amendments to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, that we expect will be finalized shortly, that provide for (i) us to make another principal paydown of $3.8 million, (ii) us to fund an additional $0.9 million into the cash collateral reserve account; (iii) a waiver of all financial covenants for quarter-end periods through September 30, 2021 with a phased-in gradual return to the full financial covenant requirements over the quarter-end periods beginning December 31, 2021 through March 31, 2023; (iv) two one-year extension options at the lender’s sole discretion (v) certain limitations and restrictions on asset sales and additional borrowings related to the pledged collateral. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

● | Paycheck Protection Program Loans - In April 2020, our hotels received $1.5 million from loans provided under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP Loans”). Subsequently, during the first quarter of 2021, our hotels received an additional $1.9 million from PPP Loans. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On June 19, 2019, the Board of Directors had previously determined to suspend regular monthly distributions and, as a result, did not declare any distributions on our Common Shares during 2020. Additionally, on March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the suspension of all redemptions under our shareholder redemption program. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2020, we had approximately $5.2 million of funds released to us from an escrow account. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the lender have agreed in principle to various amendments to its non-recourse mortgage loan secured by the Hilton Garden Inn – Long Island City, which they expect will be finalized shortly. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on these actions, along with our cash and cash equivalents on hand, we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.
 
Competition 

The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels are located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry may increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we will not be associated.
 
We have or may compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.

In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
 
Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
 
We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
 
Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the hospitality industry and any industries in which we operate to potentially offer existing property owners the opportunity to contribute properties to us in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we may a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.
 
Environmental 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
Employees 

We do not have employees. We have entered into an advisory agreement pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate-related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.
