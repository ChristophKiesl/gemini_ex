ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
NeuBase Therapeutics, Inc. (“NeuBase”,“Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is a biotechnology company focused on significantly reducing the burden of untreatable morbidity and mortality across the globe caused by rare and common diseases.
To achieve this goal, we have designed, built, and validated a new precision genetic medicines platform technology able to uniquely drug the double-stranded human genome and address disease at the root of causality without many of the limitations of early precision genetic medicine technologies.
We are poised to file our first Investigational New Drug (“INDs”) applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) beginning in calendar year 2022 and intend to scale into additional indications with increasing speed and efficiency.
Overview
Most diseases remain undruggable with current therapeutic modalities, leaving millions of patients with limited options. These include rare diseases, cancers, common chronic and infectious diseases. Most diseases are genetic, in whole or in part, underscoring the critical importance of new medicines that can drug the human genome for the future of health. Yet the genome has been difficult to target with therapies due to its double-stranded structure, which evolved to protect the fidelity of this essential blueprint of life.
Genes in the genome are “transcribed” into RNA which are then usually “translated” into proteins. As a result of the historical inability to drug the genome directly to address root causality, the pharmaceutical industry moved downstream, initially working to drug the protein products of genes. The complexity associated with drugging proteins, each of which is a unique and often dynamic molecular entity, has resulted in a drug development process that is commonly inefficient, time-consuming, and expensive with low probabilities of success. This strategy has, in part, resulted in high drug prices and a high remaining burden of unmet patient need.
These issues could potentially be resolved by targeting the genetic material itself, instead of downstream protein products. Precision genetic medicines represent a relatively new class of therapies that target genetic sequences that are the root cause of diseases. While early precision genetic medicines companies have proven that human disease can be addressed at the genetic level, the nascent field remains fragmented with most technologies only able to address a single causal genetic mechanism (either gain-of-function, change-of-function, or loss-of-function of a gene). Most technologies still act downstream at the RNA level and exhibit limitations relating to delivery, tolerability, selectivity, manufacturability, durability of effect and scalability.
We have designed, built, and validated a new technology platform that can uniquely Drug the Genome™ to address the three disease-causing mechanisms (i.e., gain-of-function, change-of-function, or loss-of-function of a gene), without the limitations of early precision genetic medicines. Our technology is predicated on synthetic peptide-nucleic acid (“PNA”) chemistry and can directly engage the genome in a sequence-specific manner and address root causality of diseases. These compounds operate by temporarily engaging the genome (or single and double-stranded RNA targets if desired) and interfering with cellular machinery that process mutant genes to halt their ability to manifest a disease. We have now repeatedly demonstrated, in proof-of-concept preclinical animal studies across FY2020 and FY2021, the ability to address multiple disease-causing genes, and different causal mechanisms, to resolve the disease state without the limitations of early genetic medicine technologies. These limitations, and the data that illustrates that we have likely engineered them out of our platform to potentially unlock broad impact across many diseases, are:

● | Delivery. Most early precision genetic medicine technologies are large and heavily negatively charged, making it difficult for them to broadly distribute throughout the body to address tissues that are affected by many diseases. This often requires them to be locally injected such as into the brain, likely limiting their ability for broad-based impact. We have designed and developed a proprietary delivery technology that allows our small, neutral-charge and water soluble compounds to be administered using a patient-friendly route such as subcutaneous injection and achieve broad biodistribution, including into the deep brain and nuclei of cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Validating data. Pre-clinical non-human primate (“NHP”) data presented in FY2020 illustrated the ability of a 5mg/kg systemic injection of the delivery shuttle to distribute into every tissue examined at therapeutically relevant concentrations, defined as concentrations which show activity in patient-derived cell lines when coupled to a pharmacophore. More recently, in FY2021, we presented data illustrating that the delivery shuttle conjugated to a NT-0200 program compound could be injected subcutaneously into the HSALR transgenic animal model of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (“DM1”) and achieve both molecular and functional rescue of myotonia in the distant tibialis anterior muscle group in the transgenic animal. Also, in FY2021, we presented data that illustrate that subcutaneous injection of the same delivery shuttle conjugated to a compound for the NT-0100 program into the zQ175 transgenic animal model of Huntington’s disease (“HD”) could, within 7 days from first dose cross the blood-brain barrier in sufficient concentrations to engage the mutant gene target and reduce the resultant protein levels from whole brain isolates to a statistically significant degree. This delivery shuttle is now utilized in all the current therapeutic development programs to move payloads to various tissues that are affected by diseases after patient-friendly routes of systemic administration. Delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier and into muscle via a systemic route has been a significant challenge in the industry.

● | Tolerability. Most early precision genetic medicine technologies trigger the innate and/or acquired immune system, limiting their ability to achieve pharmacologic doses or to be used repeatedly. For example, delivery of negatively charged nucleic acid therapies often trigger the innate immune system and delivery of proteins often trigger the acquired immune system. Our technology is comprised of fully synthetic compounds that have been shown to be “immunologically inert”, potentially allowing them to be administered chronically to temporarily Drug the Genome™ over a patient’s lifetime.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validating data. We have illustrated good tolerability of a variety of compounds across our various programs in rodent and NHP animal models across FY2020 and FY2021, with both single and multi-dose administration. This data includes a lack of an obvious acute immune response in NHPs which has been seen with other early precision genetic medicines. Exploratory multi-species toxicology data will be presented in our DM1 program in 1H2022 (calendar year).

● | Selectivity. Many technologies in the early precision genetic medicines industry cannot discriminate between mutant gene sequences and their healthy (“wild-type”) counterparts, nor between other highly similar target sequences in the cell. This potentially limits these technologies in their ability to address small disease-causing mutations such as single nucleotide changes (“point mutations”), which account for a large fraction of disease-causing mutations and functional variants. Our technology can discriminate point mutations, which increases the opportunity space. This capability comes from the “rigid” nature of the backbone which does not tolerate imperfect target engagement. In addition, this single-base selectivity reduces the likelihood that our compounds will engage with genes elsewhere in the genome that are similar but not identical, potentially reducing any adverse events triggered by off-target engagement (“OTEs”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validating data. In FY2021 we presented data illustrating that we could achieve near-perfect selectivity in engaging the mutant G12D copy of the KRAS gene vs. the wild-type copy and inhibiting transcription and translation of the resultant mutant protein production in vitro. When these compounds are delivered to xenograft animal models with KRAS-mutation driven tumors, significant tumor growth reductions and signaling through downstream effectors of the KRAS pathway were measured while being well-tolerated as a gross measure of allele-selectivity. In FY2021 we also presented data that illustrated statistically significant allele-selective knock-down of mutant Huntingtin (“HTT”) protein vs. healthy wild-type protein after subcutaneous injection into the zQ175 transgenic animal model.

● | Manufacturability. Many technologies in the early precision genetic medicines industry require significant investments in custom manufacturing infrastructure, and thus are limited in their potential impact and scalability. Our technology utilizes established and fully commoditized manufacturing processes, both for small molecule and synthetic peptide synthesis (the combination of which are required to manufacture our compounds) that are available with high redundancy and at commercial scale.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validating data. In FY2021 we nominated a development candidate for our DM1 program and initiated manufacturing scale up with several contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) across the globe. Within a period of months, for relatively low cost compared to the investment required to build bespoke manufacturing facilities, we established redundancy in manufacturing for GLP and GMP materials at a scale sufficient for our work through Phase 1/2 clinical trials.





● | Durability. Many technologies in the early precision genetic medicines industry can only be dosed a single time, are often cleared by the immune system, or are otherwise not durable in their efficacy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validating data. We illustrated in preclinical studies in FY2020 that our delivery shuttle when delivered systemically into NHPs, is rapidly taken up into tissues across the body, and very slowly eliminated via the kidneys. Elimination of the delivery shuttle occurred at approximately 4% of the administered dose over the course of one week, promising an enduring response.

● | Scalability. Many technologies in the early precision genetic medicines industry are not truly scalable across a variety of indications, for the reasons described above. As our goal is to provide solutions to those suffering from a wide variety of diseases across the globe, we have purpose-built a scalable platform. We always address a single target type for all therapeutic programs (the genome), utilize the same delivery shuttle enabling similar pharmacokinetics (“PK”), absorption distribution metabolism and excretion (“ADME”), dose, route and regimens across programs, utilize predominantly the same chemistry yielding similar therapeutic indices, are able to predict OTEs a priori using bioinformatics and engineer around them before beginning development, and leverage manufacturing process development across programs such that ongoing platform learnings have already created increasing speed and efficiency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Validating data. In FY2021 we launched a new set of programs in oncology targeting the most prevalent and currently undruggable KRAS mutations. The development of a series of hits was achieved with an order of magnitude higher efficiency that with our first two programs, based on a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships uncovered in our initial programs and use of the same delivery shuttle for seamless in vivo pharmacologic testing.
As further validation of the PATrOL™ platform’s capabilities, in FY2021, we described data illustrating that our first-in-class platform technology can address various types of causal insults by Drugging the Genome™ in animal models of a variety of human diseases after patient-friendly routes of administration and does so in a well-tolerated manner.
Based on what we believe is a solid foundation, FY2021 marked a transition from a research-stage to a development-stage company. We established new Research laboratories and Administrative offices in Pittsburgh, PA, expanded our pipeline to include both rare disease and oncology, recruited clinical development and Chemistry manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) teams, established offices in Cambridge MA, nominated a development compound for our DM1 program, initiated good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) manufacturing scale up, finalized the formulation work for subcutaneous and intravenous routes, initiated PK/ADME studies with the DM1 development candidate, and initiated PK/pharmacodynamics (“PD”) studies to define the dosing regimen for initial human studies. In addition, we have continued to optimize candidates for our HD and KRAS programs, illustrating pharmacology in vivo in appropriate animal models of each. Additionally, in FY2021, we developed a proprietary genetic disease database with utility in prioritization of pipeline expansion and partnership opportunities.
We are poised to file a series of IND applications for indications with large unmet needs such as DM1, which is expected to reach IND application filing by the end of CY2022, HD expected to reach IND application in CY2023 and cancers (KRAS G12V and G12D mutations) likely thereafter.




In advance of our first IND application filing in the fourth quarter of CY2022 and our subsequent planned transition to a clinical stage company in our combined Phase 1/2 clinical trial in DM1, the following data sets are planned to be disseminated:

​
The NeuBase Opportunity
Many diseases remain undruggable with current therapeutic modalities. These include rare diseases, cancers, common chronic and infectious diseases. Most diseases are driven by functional genetic variants (including mutations). We are advancing first-in-class ultra-precision genetic medicines to Drug the Genome™ and address disease at its root cause with the goal of helping potentially millions of patients who currently have no therapeutic options.
Historically, malfunctioning proteins (the products of malfunctioning genes) have been targeted by small molecules, antibodies, or protein replacement therapies to address disease states. The fundamental challenge with these strategies has been related to a lack of an ability to accurately model protein structures and the associated structural dynamics in an easy and high-throughput manner so that drugs could be intelligently designed. In addition, biologics have been hampered by delivery challenges, such as accessibility to the organ, cell type or subcellular compartment where the missing protein is required to resolve functionality and by immunogenicity related to delivering a foreign antigenic protein into the body. Recent advances in computational methods promise to enable accurate protein structure modeling in a high-throughput manner allowing intelligently designed protein-targeting medicines. While this 




potentially accelerates early target engagement activities, challenges related to accurately predicting and addressing structural dynamics of the target and off-target engagement with the multitude of other molecules in the body remain daunting. Delivery challenges and immunogenicity with large molecular weight biologics persist. The challenges of drug development targeting proteins have manifested themselves in high drug pricing in the market and large remaining unmet needs for patients.
In almost every human disease, a genetic variant is introduced into a cell, either through inheritance or de novo (for example, by a mutagen) at some point in development that causes the normal cellular processes to go awry. Diseases can either be completely driven by such a single genetic variant (termed a “mutation”) or by individual or combinations of several variants (often referred to as “functional variants”) often with environmental triggers.
Sequencing of the human genome set the stage for the advent of drugs that can target nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) upstream of proteins and closer to the root of disease causality. The world’s collective knowledge of the human genome, and our ability to apply that knowledge to the development of medicines that can cure disease and mitigate suffering, has resulted in a new category of therapeutic commonly referred to as “precision genetic medicines.” In the approximately 20 years since the scientific community has delivered the first draft of the human genome sequence, efforts across the globe have identified the genetic variants that cause thousands of different diseases and consolidated this variant information into accessible databases. In parallel, a molecular diagnostics industry has matured to enable many patients to get access to the precise genetic variant that causes their disease. Today, because of these advances, it is possible to know the gene and sequence variants that must be targeted for a specific disease indication, and it is also possible to identify patients who will benefit from these therapies, thus giving rise to the precision genetic medicines industry.
In parallel, a computational infrastructure has been developed that allows precision genetic medicines companies to house and query the genome to design medicines that precisely target genes that cause disease, and also to reduce or eliminate engagement of these drugs with other highly similar sequences. Precision genetic medicines can target either DNA or RNA. Each cell in the human body contains two copies of the approximately 3 billion letter “haploid” genetic code, one copy inherited from each parent. At conception, a single fertilized egg, containing a complete approximately 6 billion letter “diploid” genome will contain all the necessary hereditary information to give rise to a complete human being. Each cell divides into daughter cells as an individual grows and develops and through the cell division process receives a replicate of the genome. Upon adulthood, a human being is comprised of trillions of individual cells, each of which is operating with a diploid genome that controls its function in the complete organism by activating various genes in various combinations at various times. Computational expertise and infrastructure have enabled the industry.
The human genome is double-stranded, an evolutionary mechanism thought to have arisen to protect this essential molecule against insult and degradation. This same protective mechanism has made directly drugging the genome difficult. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in targeting genes, instead of proteins, to address diseases. Targeting nucleic acids allows one to utilize nature’s own digital information encoding system, Watson-Crick nucleobase binding which forms the basis of the double-helix of DNA, to engage an exact genetic target with a genetic medicine. Most early strategies target disease processes downstream of the double-stranded human genome primarily because early technologies cannot access the double-stranded genome. Thus, most precision genetic medicines focus on drugging RNA and are constrained to stretches of accessible single stranded portions of a target RNA.
Genes in the genome are “transcribed” into RNA molecules, which are processed by splicing events, which remove intervening sequences (“introns”) and often various combinations of protein coding sequences (“exons”) into mature messenger RNAs (“mRNA”) to form a diversity of molecules from each gene. In addition, the rate of transcription of each gene in each cell type and at each time in development, balanced with the metabolism of each mRNA molecule which often differs between transcripts, adds additional complexity to targeting RNA in disease conditions. These mRNA species are then generally translated into proteins. Each mRNA molecule can be translated into many protein molecules before it is eventually degraded. After a protein is made, it often goes through a process of “post-translational” modification, which often trims the protein and/or adds modifications such as sugar or phosphate groups onto the proteins. Thus, a single mutant gene (present in either one or two copies in most diseases) outputs many different mRNA molecules and in turn, a diversity of protein molecules with additional structural and functional complexities derived from alternative splicing. Thus, we believe that grappling with disease at the protein or RNA is inherently more complex than targeting the DNA itself, and due to our unique ability to engage the double-stranded genome to modulate gene output and/or function we believe that we have a more scalable and differentiated opportunity.
Efforts to target genes that contain disease-causing variants at the RNA and DNA level have illustrated human clinical benefit in altering the natural history of several diseases. RNA and DNA medicines generally fall into three categories: gene silencing, gene replacement and gene editing, without a single unifying technology, prior to NeuBase to potentially unify the industry. RNA silencing 




is centered on degrading the target transcript most often using antisense oligonucleotides (“ASOs”) or RNA interference (“RNAi”). Changing the function of an RNA can be done using splice modification or emerging RNA editing technologies. Activating RNA is being done by mRNA replacement. These therapies have transformed care for a handful of genetic and infectious diseases and prove that precision genetic medicines can resolve disease upstream of proteins.
In general, addressing each of the three main pathogenic mechanisms is done using a distinct technology. In general, the larger size and negatively charged backbones of first-generation genetic medicines therapies have posed delivery challenges. For example, the scavenger receptors in the liver clear circulating negatively charged modified nucleic acids, and tolerability issues such as immunogenicity can be seen with current RNA therapeutics due to intracellular TLR9 receptor activation and triggering on a TH1 innate immune response, a response used by the body to fight infections. First generation genetic medicines have exhibited selectivity challenges as they are often unable to adequately discriminate between small mutations and normal gene sequences. While delivery modalities of first-generation genetic medicines continue to improve with, for example, antibody-mediated delivery, they also present new manufacturing and immunogenicity complexities. Non-permanent mRNA replacement technologies also continue to improve, promising the potential to eliminate the need to encapsulate transcripts to protect them from degradation in the circulation, but tissue targeting challenges, immunogenicity and liver clearance issues will likely persist.
Medicines that target DNA are being developed in the community, with gene replacement and gene editing showing clinical successes. These approaches are meant to be permanent, which on the one hand would allow patients to live disease-free lives, but on the other hand pose challenges related to the level of rigor necessary to ensure mistakes do not occur. Gene replacement is generally currently done using viral vector-delivered gene therapies. Gene therapy can often only be administered once because patients exhibit an immune response against the viral delivery vectors. Further, gene therapy often results in heterogeneous cellular distribution. Non-viral delivery technologies are improving, which may allow DNA replacement strategies for loss-of-function conditions to mature more rapidly in the coming years. Gene editing technologies have also recently shown human in vivo clinical activity and early tolerability, but issues related to off-target editing and permanently modifying the germ cells of patients warrant caution in developing gene editing solutions. Current strategies are also defined by delivering large molecular complexes which are difficult to distribute and often include likely antigenic protein complexes, relegating most gene editing activities to ex vivo cell editing and strategies, followed by cell therapy. Gene therapy and gene editing have limitations related to delivery of high molecular weight molecules and accessing tissues at the sites of pathology, immunogenicity, durability, and safety.
We have an opportunity, with our technology platform, to scale our proprietary genetic medicines that target mutant genes at their root cause by Drugging the Genome™. We have shown in pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies that the platform technology can address most causal mechanisms of disease at the genetic level by gene silencing, gene editing or gene activating which leads to the potential of a unifying platform for the industry. Because we can drug the genome upstream of the complexity that occurs during transcription, splicing, translation and post-translational processes, and using common chemistry to engage a common target type, there are opportunities to scale across indications.
In addition, we have demonstrated with pre-clinical data in several disease indications that our PATrOL™ platform-enabled precision genetic medicines have additional benefits that have limited other genetic medicines. We have successfully validated our PATrOL™ platform’s ability to efficiently deliver genetic medicines with broad tissue distribution, including into the deep brain, and precisely engage DNA (and RNA) with a favorable safety profile and potential for sustained efficacy. These platform benefits include:





​ | ​ 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Broad bio-distribution after systemic administration including into all tissues examined at therapeutic concentrations: our compounds are water soluble and neutral in charge and achieve broad delivery, including into the deep brain, after systemic administration. 
​ | ​ 
 | Low potential for immunogenicity allowing for repeat chronic drugging of the genome: the chemistry that forms the workhorse of the platform has been extensively shown to be well tolerated in vivo at and above effective concentrations. 
​ | ​ 
 | Discriminates between mutant and healthy genes with single-base selectivity to reduce off-target effects: The ability to engage and bind to double-stranded DNA or single- and double-stranded RNA sequences enables better differentiation between mutant and healthy genes. 
​ | ​ 
 | Leverages existing CMOs: our precision genetic medicines are made using commoditized small molecule and synthetic peptide manufacturing infrastructure enabling cost-effect development and rapid commercial scaling. 
​ | ​ 
 | Is stable in biological fluids and resistant to protease or nuclease digestion due to the PNA chemistry, and when coupled to the proprietary delivery shuttle is rapidly taken up from the circulation into tissues where is resides and is slowly eliminated over time through the kidneys. 
​ | ​ 
 | Use of the identical delivery shuttle across programs, engagement with a single target type with known engagement sites across diseases, the ability to predict and engineer out OTEs in advance, and the ability to reinvest process development and knowledge for increasing speed and efficiencies.

​
We designed and purpose-built a first-in-class technology platform and illustrated that the platform-enabled precision genetic medicines can precisely engage gene mutations and resolve root causality in three different diseases with different mechanisms of action, and in a well-tolerated manner.




Establishment of this novel platform was a focus of ours from initiation of operations in mid-CY2019 until mid-CY2021. At approximately that time, we evolved to include clinical development and CMC activities. The process of building a first-in-class genetic medicines platform company is unique based on the technology being developed, and that process is articulated in Figure 1, which includes an overview of platform related achievements in FY2021.
​
​
Figure 1. Major milestones achieved in establishing the first-in-class PATrOL™ platform, including development of a novel delivery shuttle that enables broad biodistribution including into the brain after systemic administration and culminating in multiple in vivo proof-of-concept data sets in high-value indications illustrating resolution of causality and tolerability. Each platform has a novel path to implementation and here we articulate the efforts over the first approximately 24 months that positioned us to file our first IND.
As a result of this platform proof-of-concept in vivo pharmacology and tolerability data, we have begun the IND-enabling activities, which will support our first human clinical trials, and a process of scaling across additional disease indications over time to achieve the long-term objective of a high-impact company. Our precision genetic medicine pipeline includes a myotonic dystrophy type 1 program (in which an IND is expected to be filed with the FDA in the fourth quarter of CY2022) and programs for Huntington’s disease and cancer (KRAS G12V and G12D mutations) in preclinical studies. Pipeline expansion into new disease areas uniquely addressable with our PATrOL™ platform is expected to continue.
The market need is enormous for a company that is able to address disease at a genetic level with a scalable technology platform. Globally, there are thousands of genetic diseases, most of which lack any therapeutic options. Most human diseases are genetic. Traditionally, therapeutic development for each disorder has been approached with a unique strategy, which is inefficient, and has resulted in a large remaining unmet need and high drug prices in the marketplace. The collective population of people with untreatable diseases, numbering in the hundreds of millions, stands to potentially benefit profoundly from the emergence of a scalable and modular treatment development platform that allows for a more efficient discovery and delivery of drug product candidates to address these conditions cohesively.
In summary, as a result of the Human Genome Project, global efforts to catalog genetic variants that cause or predispose to human disease and genetic testing infrastructure to enable patients to avail themselves of precision genetic medicines, the stage is now set for us to begin development efforts across a series of human disease with no currently available therapies and large addressable market sizes. The relatively new strategies of targeting DNA and RNA molecules upstream of proteins to address disease at the genetic level have achieved human proof-of-concept, yet these early technologies are fragmented in their ability to address the different causal mechanisms, and suffer from limitations related to delivery, tolerability, selectivity, manufacturability, durability and scalability. We believe we have a unifying solution without the limitations of other precision genetic medicine technologies that will allow us to address many diseases, both rare and common.




The PATrOL™ Platform Technology
We have designed and purpose-built a novel technology platform to address disease-causing genetic variants without the limitations of early precision genetic medicines. At the surface, our platform-enabled compounds resemble short single strands of DNA (oligonucleotides) with extremely high biding affinity that allows them to uniquely invade the human double-stranded genome. Our compounds have nucleobases that are arranged in the correct sequence to engage a known gene target, a backbone which holds the nucleobases at the proper spacing to engage a target, and an additional module which is our proprietary delivery technology. These compounds are completely synthetic molecules. The pharmacophore’s neutral charge is key to broad cell and tissue distribution, penetrating cell nuclei and the deep brain. Figure 2 below illustrates a conceptual overview of how our PATrOL™ platform technology functions.

​
Figure 2. Conceptual overview of the process by which NeuBase compounds enter the cell after systemic administration, engage genes within the double-stranded DNA (or RNA) and resolves root causality. A proprietary delivery shuttle coupled to modified peptide-nucleic acid oligonucleotides allow systemic delivery with broad bio-distribution including into the central nervous system, cellular entry in a non-cell type or species-specific manner, and single-base selective target engagement in the nucleus within 24 hours of dosing with a variety of binding modes that can be used to address various genetic lesions to modulate gene function based on steric interference with cellular machinery such as RNA polymerase and transcription factors. Gene editing takes advantage of recruiting endogenous high-fidelity repair enzymes and does not require delivery of proteins nor induction of double-stranded DNA breaks. The technology is also able to engage single- and double-stranded RNA in the cytoplasm and trophism for one type of nucleic acid versus another can be induced through backbone modifications.
The PATrOL™ platform is comprised of three main component modules: new nucleobases, a neutral- charged backbone, and novel delivery shuttles (Figure 3). Each of these three component modules has been specifically designed to interact with one another to achieve the desired function and can be “tuned” to refine that function.




New Nucleobases. We have assembled and invented a kit of nucleobases which can be arranged in a specific order onto a backbone so that they engage a genetic target. It is the order, or sequence, of the nucleobases that define the location within the target gene that the compound will ultimately engage. We can use natural nucleobases (that are used by the human body to construct its own genetic material); these are cytosine (“C”), guanine (“G”), adenine (“A”), thymine (“T”) and uracil (“U”). These natural nucleobases are often used as their properties are well understood and they provide for standard Watson-Crick hydrogen binding between complementary nucleobases (A to T/U; G to C). These natural nucleobases can also be modified through chemical engineering to strengthen or weaken certain positions of engagement. The combination of natural nucleobases with the neutral-charge backbone and proprietary backbone modifications allows the fully constructed compound to “invade” the double helix (or a double-stranded RNA molecule) by out-competing the complementary DNA (or RNA) strand due to a higher binding affinity for the target sequence. This ability to invade double-stranded targets also allows increased efficiency when designing compounds against RNA targets as secondary structures are less likely to interfere with target engagement and confound optimal sequence targeting. Once the PATrOL™-enabled compound has invaded, it binds via standard Watson-Crick base-pairing.
A second class of nucleobases are Hoogsteen nucleobases. When coupled to the proprietary neutral-charge backbone, Hoogsteen nucleobases allow a PATrOL™-enabled compound to scan the outside of the double helix by querying nucleobase content inside the double helix through the major groove. When a sequence match is found between these types of nucleobases and the fully Watson-Crick paired natural nucleobases inside the double helix, a triplex structure is formed.
A third class of nucleobases are termed Janus nucleobases. Janus bases are bi-specific nucleobases that can be considered natural nucleobases with a second binding face chemically engineered onto them to allow simultaneous engagement of two strands of nucleic acids. There are 16 possible Janus bases that will engage with any two strands of nucleic acids of interest. For example, Janus bases can be used in an invader use-case to double the number of hydrogen bonds that are engaged for a fixed sequence length when drugging the double helix, binding both the Watson and the Crick strands simultaneously and increasing the specificity of engagement. These bi-specific nucleobases have been shown to enable accessing double stranded RNA targets comprised of secondary structures such as imperfect hairpins (double stranded RNA targets which are folded upon themselves). In programs where we are drugging an RNA, this allows us to potentially access regions of the target molecule which may be unique in secondary structure relative to the wild-type RNA to allow enhanced selectivity for the target.




Importantly, all these nucleobases which allow sequence-specific recognition of a gene within a target double-stranded nucleic acid are required to be used in combination with our neutral-charged backbone. Without the backbone, the nucleobases do not have the ability to engage utilizing these various binding modes.
Neutral-Charged Backbone. Peptide-nucleic acids (“PNA”) form the predicate chemistry for our backbones. The key differentiator between a PNA backbone and most traditional nucleic acid backbones (like the backbones in DNA and RNA) or modified backbones (like the backbones that are used by various companies in the genetic medicines space) is that the PNA backbone is neutral (not anionic), in charge and helical in their secondary structure. PNAs use a synthetic polyamide backbone subunit (“monomer”), which, in our construction, is charge-neutral and characterized by high binding affinity to a nucleic acid target. The high binding affinity is due in part to the neutral charge that does not repulse its target nucleic acid, but also due to our ability to induce helicity through backbone modifications and thereby reduce the energy requirement necessary to engage a nucleic acid target. These features allow the nucleobases to perform in the required manner to either invade or form triplex structures. Another major differentiator of our backbone technology is, we believe, industry leading sequence selectivity of target engagement imparted by the “rigidity” of the backbone and conferring an intolerance for sequence mismatches. This manifests in an advantage to better differentiate mutant gene sequences from their wild-type counterparts, and in potentially reducing OTEs with highly similar sequences elsewhere in the genome. The backbones have high stability in biological fluids and are resistant to protease and nuclease digestion, contributing to their enduring presence in tissues after systemic administration and, we believe, to their ability to redistribute in and out of tissues over time via the circulatory system. PNA backbones have been described in the literature and by us to not trigger an innate nor acquired immune response, a key limiter of other precision genetic medicines, and potentially allow routine dosing.
We believe we are a leader in the development of the next generation of genetic medicines. We have exclusively licensed and developed proprietary innovations around PNAs that potentially enable them to be used as pharmaceuticals to address most causal mechanisms of disease by Drugging the Genome™. Our PNAs can modulate the machinery controlling gene function and fidelity, exhibit wide bio-distribution after systemic administration, including into the brain, a favorable tolerability profile, and high sequence selectivity. Our PATrOL™-enabled precision genetic medicines may be manufactured via well commoditized peptide synthetic methods in a GMP setting. We have established a decentralized, outsourced and cost effective global supply and manufacturing infrastructure to allow rapid scaling across indications.
Novel Delivery Shuttles. The third component of our modular platform is a proprietary delivery technology that works in conjunction with the backbone chemistry to enable systemic administration and achieve broad bio-distribution. The delivery shuttle is of low molecular weight, approximately 1.5 kD in size, synthetic in nature, likely non-immunogenic and is likely cell, tissue, and species agnostic in its ability to delivery our neutral water-soluble compounds into the cytoplasm or nucleus. We have previously (in FY2020) presented data with our first delivery shuttle in non-human primates (“NHPs”), which described systemic administration via an intravenous route having an in-circulation half-life of approximately 1.5 hours during which time the shuttle is taken up into every tissue in the body, including into the brain, within 4 hours post single-dose. Elimination is primarily through the renal system, and occurs slowly, with only approximately 4% of the administered dose excreted over the course of 7 days after single-dose injection. This delivery shuttle also appears to rapidly pass through the cell membranes of all cell types tested and, when coupled to a pharmacophore, engage the genetic target in less than 24 hours (earliest timepoint tested) in both cell culture and after systemic administration in vivo. We disseminated data illustrating this feature in both the DM1 and HD programs after a subcutaneous injection in FY2021. This delivery technology is currently being used for several of our therapeutic programs but does not preclude us from using various delivery technologies with our backbones.
The Therapeutic Pipeline
We are developing precision genetic medicines targeting rare, monogenic diseases, for which there are no approved therapies, as well as more common genetic disorders, including cancers that are resistant to current therapeutic approaches. Our pipeline includes therapeutic candidates for the treatment of DM1, HD, and cancer-driving point mutations in KRAS, G12V and G12D, which are involved in many tumor types and have historically been “undruggable” (Figure 4).
Based on compelling results from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies, we plan to file an IND application for our DM1 investigational therapy in the fourth quarter of CY2022. We are targeting CY2023 to file an IND application for an investigational therapy to treat Huntington’s disease. Both are devastating systemic diseases with no effective therapies. Our oncology program has recently been announced (FY2021) together with in vivo activity illustrating allele-selective engagement of mutant KRAS at the DNA and RNA levels, with abrogation of downstream hyperactive signaling through multiple RAS pathway members, resulting in anti-




tumor activity. We continue to improve upon our platform while concurrently developing programs, resulting in next-generation compounds that continue to make their way through preclinical development in a parallel manner. We have recently finalized an analysis of the entire known mutational database and selected several additional high-value indications for screening and development.

Figure 4. The initial pipeline in rare disease and oncology, with platform learnings increasing the efficiency and speed additional undisclosed programs, both internally developed and in discussions for co-development with partners.
Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1): NT-0200 Program
DM1 exhibits whole-body manifestations. It is a multi-system, progressive disorder characterized by weakness of smooth and skeletal muscles that can range from mild to severe, myotonia, cardiac conduction defects, cognitive deficits, respiratory distress, and shortened lifespan. Current treatment options include therapies to manage the symptoms, physical therapy, and assistive devices. No treatments that slow or stop the progression of DM1 are currently FDA approved. It is estimated that the global prevalence of DM1 is approximately 1 in 20,000 individuals.
Figure 5. NT-0200 program mechanism of action to resolve root causality. Different from other approaches, our DM1 drug candidate is designed to specifically target and not degrade the mutated DMPK RNA. Restoring mRNA splicing and downstream correct protein production, including DMPK, our precision genetic approach has the potential to be disease-modifying.
DM1 is caused by a single inherited copy of a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 3’ untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal and often patients have hundreds or thousands of repeat units. When transcribed into RNA, the expanded trinucleotide repeat creates a molecular hairpin structure that is toxic in that it results in broad mRNA splicing abnormalities in hundreds to thousands of mRNAs in the cell, characterized by a reversion from adult gene/protein isoforms to embryonic isoforms, which affect protein function in some cases (for example the skeletal muscle chloride channel). The toxic RNA hairpin sequesters muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins making them unavailable for normal developmentally appropriate splice regulation in the nucleus of affected cells. The altered protein isoforms result in DM1’s numerous symptoms. DM1 is a multi-system disorder which would benefit from a whole-body solution.
In addition to sequestration of MBNL proteins, upregulation of the CELF1 protein (also known as CUGBP1) is a consistent feature of the disease. Importantly, patients also appear to have a haploinsufficiency of the DMPK protein resulting from entrapment of the toxic transcript in the nucleus in aggregates with MBNL such that it is not translated into a protein, with only the healthy wild-type allele being trafficked into the cytosol and being translated into a functional protein. It is unclear whether the haploinsufficiency contributes to the clinical condition, but it should be noted that the knock-out mouse model does manifest a cardiac and brain phenotype, such that it is reasonable to assume that total loss of DMPK protein is not desirable. Mice with both copies of their Dmpk gene knocked out manifest a cardiac conduction defect (Berul CI et al. Dpmk dosage alterations result in atrioventricular conduction abnormalities in a mouse myotonic dystrophy model. J Clin Invest. 1999 Feb;103(4):R1-7) and a CNS phenotype characterized by abnormal long-term potentiation hypothesized to be due to inappropriate cytoskeletal remodeling (Schulz PE et al. A role for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase in synaptic plasticity. J Neurophysiol. 2003 Mar;89(3):1177-86). Thus, strategies that explicitly degrade the wild-type and the mutant DMPK mRNA using ASOs or siRNAs may cause a secondary clinical condition in patients.
Our mechanistic strategy for the NT0200 program is to engage with the toxic RNA hairpin structure directly and release aggregated MBLN via steric displacement to restore normal RNA splicing and downstream protein production. Figure 5 illustrates the mechanism of action of our compound that targets double-stranded RNA in the nucleus of affected cells. There are several other CUG repeats in other transcripts in the human transcriptome, but they are short (<20 repeat units in length) and in studies to date we see no OTEs against these homologous sequences (that have been tested) nor cytotoxicity in patient-derived cell lines nor in wild-type or transgenic murine models at and above therapeutic concentrations.
Preclinical data previously presented demonstrated that our development candidate maintains DMPK protein levels in patient-derived cell lines after dosing and rescues the root genetic defect to normalize miss-spliced muscle mRNA transcripts in the HSALR transgenic mouse model. This has been illustrated via both an intravenous dose (single 29 mg/kg) and a subcutaneous dose (3 mg/kg multi-dose). We have also previously presented data that illustrates functional rescue of myotonia in the HSALR transgenic mouse after multi-subcutaneous dosing of 3 mg/kg (Figure 6).
In addition to splice rescue and functional rescue of myotonia that we have illustrated in the HSALR transgenic animal model, we have also illustrated target engagement and disruption of the characteristic nuclear aggregates in the tibialis anterior muscles of affected animals, and rescue of the Clcn1 protein production by immunoblotting after treatment. Restoration of the Clcn1 channel protein is required to achieve functional rescue of myotonia.




We believe that our therapeutic solution has the potential to offer patients a differentiated option in the marketplace, which includes:

● | A whole-body solution to address muscle, heart, and brain pathologies based on NHP PK/biodistribution data
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designed to maintain DMPK protein as opposed to explicitly degrade it, which is likely important for health
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A patient-friendly systemic route such as subcutaneous administration
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The path forward in CY2022. The PATrOL™-enabled NT-0200 program is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of DM1. We have nominated a development candidate and initiated chemistry manufacturing controls (“CMC”) scale-up for IND-enabling toxicology and plan to follow with Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Activities planned for calendar year 1H2022 include rodent and NHP pharmacokinetics (“PK”)/Absorption Distribution Metabolism and Excretion (“ADME”) and bioavailability studies (via IV and SQ routes of administration), and single and multiple dose rodent & NHP exploratory toxicology studies. In calendar year 2H2022, we plan to undertake IND-enabling toxicology studies, mechanism-of-action studies, and an IND filing planned in the fourth quarter of CY2022. We plan to present the results of these studies at various scientific and clinical meetings during CY2022 and beyond.
Huntington’s Disease (HD): NT-0100 Program
HD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal death in deep brain structures culminating in progressive impairments in movement and cognitive control followed by death. Current treatment options attempt to lessen involuntary movement and psychiatric symptoms, but disease-modifying treatments have yet to successfully advance through clinical trials.

Figure 7. NT-0100 Mechanism of action to resolve root causality. DNA-binders (NT-0100D) and RNA-binders (NT-0100R) allele-selective compounds inhibit transcription and translation, respectively to knock down mutant HTT protein while maintaining normal HTT.
HD is caused by a single inherited copy of a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the Huntingtin gene. The expanded trinucleotide repeat is transcribed into RNA and translated into an abnormally sticky version of the Huntingtin protein, characterized by a poly-glutamine stretch of amino acids proximal to the amino-terminus of the protein. This mutant protein leads to toxic accumulation in neurons and eventual neuronal cell death, followed by death of cells throughout the body over time.
The wild-type HTT (“wtHTT”) gene has a region in which a three-base DNA sequence, CAG, is repeated many times. When the DNA sequence CAG is repeated 26 or fewer times in this region, the resulting protein behaves normally. When the DNA sequence CAG is repeated 40 times or more in this region, the resulting protein becomes toxic (mtHTT). Every person has two copies, or alleles, of the HTT gene. Only one of the alleles (the “mutant” allele) needs to bear at least 40 CAG repeats for HD to occur. Current therapies for patients with HD can only manage individual symptoms. There is no approved therapy that has been shown to delay or halt disease progression. In the U.S. alone, there are likely more than 40,000 symptomatic patients and likely more than 200,000 at-risk of inheriting the disease.
The goal of the NT0100 program is to advance a drug candidate that selectively binds the mutated DNA (or mRNA) to reduce or prevent production of the mutated protein and do so while maximally maintaining healthy wild-type protein which we believe is important to normal function. One especially important advantage of the PATrOL™ platform that makes it promising for the treatment of repeat expansion disorders like HD is the ability of our investigational therapies to target the mutant double-stranded RNA hairpin in the mtHTT transcript. This allows our therapies to inactivate mtHTT mRNA before it can be translated into a harmful protein via selective binding to the expanded CAG repeats, while leaving the wtHTT mRNA relatively unbound to drug and producing functional protein. Achieving mutant allele selectivity would be a key advantage for any RNA-based approach aiming to treat HD.
Figure 8. Subcutaneous injection of NT-0100 compounds cross the blood-brain barrier and knock down mutant HTT protein selectively after only 7 days. 1zQ175 mouse model with 190 CAG repeats in exon 1 of HTT; 60 mg/kg subcutaneous dose with NT-100D candidate on day 1 & 4; sacrifice day 7; 2zQ175 mouse model with 190 CAG repeats in exon 1 of HTT; 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose with NT-0100R candidate on day 1 & 4; sacrifice day 7. For both NT-100D and NT-0100R, whole-brain homogenates from day 7 animals were used to prepare protein extracts for Western blotting using antibodies to detect both normal and mutant HTT protein.
The mechanism of our PATrOL™-enabled compounds is illustrated in Figure 7. The HTT protein is essential during embryogenesis and dependence upon HTT appears to decrease with age until adulthood, but the protein is known to be involved in a diverse range of functions and signaling pathways, so it is difficult to imagine complete loss of the protein would be tolerated.
Preclinical data from transgenic mouse zQ175 animal models demonstrate the ability of NT-0100 program candidate compounds to be administered subcutaneously, cross the blood-brain barrier, enter the parenchymal space, penetrate neuronal cell bodies and either act in the nucleus (DNA-targeting) or the cytoplasm (RNA-targeting) to reduce the production of toxic protein while maintaining production of normal HTT protein (Figure 8). We believe that a systemic route of administration allows even diffusion of the compound through the CNS with the potential to achieve therapeutic concentrations of our investigational therapies as every neuron in the brain is proximal to a vessel. This is a very different delivery route than utilizing an intrathecal injection into the spinal cord, which achieve high concentrations at the surface of the brain (cortex) but lesser and potentially ineffective concentrations in the deep brain (striatum) where neurons die first in HD. In FY2020, we illustrated the ability of our technology to enrich for translational inhibition and resultant reduction of mutant protein formation in human patient-derived cell lines versus wild-type protein production, and that our investigational therapies can inhibit ribosomal elongation via high-affinity binding to a target RNA. In FY2021, we presented new data demonstrating selective reduction of mutant Huntingtin protein in the brain after subcutaneous dosing in the zQ175 Huntington’s disease transgenic mouse model targeting both the mutant mRNA and inhibiting translation, but also now by targeting the DNA and inhibiting transcription after subcutaneous administration – not only illustrating passage across the blood-brain barrier after a patient-friendly route but also allele-selective knock-down.
We believe the potential differentiators of our HD program are:

● | Whole-body solution to address brain and body pathologies based on NHP PK/biodistribution studies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designed to maintain normal Huntingtin protein which is likely important for health
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient-friendly systemic route such as subcutaneous administration
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 9. Systemic delivery (left panel) allows even perfusion of the CNS to access the striatum. Mechanism of DNA- (middle panel) and RNA-targeted (right panel) allele-selective compounds to knock down mutant HTT protein while maintaining normal HTT.
The path forward in CY2022. The PATrOL™-enabled NT-0100 program is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of HD. We expect to file an IND application in calendar year 2023. Planned activities to support program advancement in FY2022 include illustrating reduction in mutant HTT aggregates in the brains of transgenic murine model(s) with systemic routes of administration, functional rescue of transgenic murine models with systemic routes and development candidate nomination.
Oncology (KRAS G12D and G12V): NT-0300 Program
Our oncology program targets KRAS G12D and G12V gene mutations, which are the two most common and historically “undruggable” KRAS driver mutations. There are no approved therapies for KRAS G12D or G12V mutations, which account for approximately 55% of all KRAS mutations.
We have designed novel PATrOL™-enabled compounds to selectively engage with the mutant cancer driver mutation at either the DNA or RNA level to inhibit downstream mutant KRAS protein production and hyperactive mitotic signaling. In addition, these compounds targeting KRAS codon 12 mutations have the potential to work against NRAS and HRAS mutations as there is sequence identity at the target engagement site in each mutant form of the gene. Preclinical studies have shown tumor growth inhibition after intra-tumoral administration and reduction of downstream signaling, validating that the compounds can engage the target. We have also shown preclinical data illustrating that we achieve allele-selective engagement of the mutant allele with single-nucleotide precision. Figure 9 illustrates how the compounds access the KRAS mutations in codon 12 at the DNA and RNA levels, and Figure 10 illustrates the in vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept data illustrating potency and selectivity of target engagement.
While our KRAS program is in early development, we believe it illustrates not only a viable path forward to the clinic with investigational therapies that can target the mutated gene at the level of DNA (as opposed to RNA or protein levels) which provides potential potency and dosing advantages, but also the ability of the PATrOL™-enabled compounds to achieve single-base selectivity. We believe we can scale this across missense mutations and smaller mutational events in new targets that other genetic medicine modalities have difficulty accessing selectively.
​

​
We believe the potential advantages of our KRAS inhibitors include:

● | Whole-body solution to address primary tumors and metastases
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designed to maintain normal KRAS protein which is likely important for health
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient-friendly systemic route such as intravenous or subcutaneous administration
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The path forward in CY2022. Proposed program activities include optimization of potency and selectivity, mechanism of action studies, and in vivo pharmacology studies with systemic routes of administration.
Summary
We are currently focused on therapeutic areas in which we believe our drugs will provide the greatest benefit with a significant market opportunity. We intend to utilize our technology to build a pipeline of custom designed therapeutics for additional high-value disease targets. We plan to leverage appropriate partnering strategies based on the specific drug candidate, therapeutic area expertise, and resources potential partners may bring to a collaboration. For some drug candidates, we may choose to develop and, if approved, commercialize them ourselves or through our affiliates. For other drug candidates, we may form single or multi-asset partnerships leveraging our partners’ global expertise and resources needed to support large commercial opportunities.




Preclinical studies are being conducted to evaluate the PATrOL™ platform technology and program candidates in the areas of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (“PD”) and tolerability. We reported results from certain of those studies in the first calendar quarter of 2020 and have extended upon certain of those studies in the fourth calendar quarter of 2020. These results demonstrated that our platform technology can be administered to human patient-derived cell lines and systemically (IV) into animals with DM1 (HSALR, a genetically modified mouse model accepted as representative of the human disease in skeletal muscle) to address their causal genetic defect. We also presented additional results from ongoing preclinical studies evaluating the PATrOLTM platform and pipeline indications at an R&D day in June 2021. This included functional rescue of myotonia in the HSALR DM1 transgenic animal model after a series of 4 subcutaneous loading doses, which was well tolerated, together with data describing resolution of nuclear inclusions after a single intravenous dose in the same animal model, and restoration of the murine skeletal muscle chloride channel (Clcn1), a pre-requisite to functional resolution of myotonia. In the second half of CY2021 we nominated a development candidate for DM1, finalized the hiring of a clinical development team led by a Chief Medical Officer (Sandra Rojas-Caro, M.D.) and a Chief Technology Officer (Anthony Rossomando, Ph.D.), and initiated scale-up of CMC to produce test article for the IND-enabling work and the Phase 1/2 clinical trials. The table below summarizes ongoing and planned activities in support of IND filings and pipeline expansion.

​
We plan to attend various scientific and medical conferences in CY2022 where we plan to present the results of the activities that are described in the above timeline.




Overall, using our PATrOL™ platform, we believe we can create therapies that may have distinct advantages over other chemical entities currently in the market or in development for precision genetic medicine applications to modulate mutant genes and improve a clinical trait or disorder. We employ a rational approach to selecting disease targets, considering many scientific, technical, business and indication-specific factors before choosing each indication. We intend to build a diverse portfolio of therapies to treat a variety of health conditions.
We believe the depth of our knowledge and expertise with PNAs, engineered nucleotides, genetics, genomics and therapeutic development of first-in-class modalities allows us to determine the optimal development and commercialization strategy to maximize the near and longer-term value of our therapeutic programs. We believe the breadth of the PATrOL™ platform gives us the ability to potentially address a multitude of diseases.
Intellectual Property
The initial intellectual property position behind our fundamental PATrOL™ technology was initially developed at CMU. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates in the United States and other countries. We have exclusively licensed patent applications, pursuant to our license agreement with CMU (the “CMU License Agreement”), protecting our platform for development and commercialization of therapeutics. We will continue to focus our resources on obtaining patents and filing new patent applications that drive value.
We have an exclusive license to patent applications pursuant to the CMU License Agreement that may provide exclusivity for product candidates in our pipeline and may provide exclusivity for our core technology. Our core technology patent applications are directed to chemically-modified nucleosides and peptide nucleic acids to form compounds of biological and clinical interest. We have exclusively licensed patent applications pursuant to the CMU License Agreement to cover 16 Janus bases and treatment of repeat expansion disorders using this technology.
Peptide Nucleic Acids containing Modified Nucleobases
We have exclusively licensed patent applications pursuant to the CMU License Agreement covering peptide nucleic acid oligomers containing modified nucleobases, which can be used as a basis for therapeutics. Nucleosides and chemically modified nucleosides are the basic building blocks of our drug development platform. Therefore, claims that cover an oligonucleotide incorporating one of our proprietary modified nucleosides may apply to a wide array of mechanisms of action and therapeutic targets. Our modified nucleobases may comprise a divalent nucleobase in sequence with several other divalent nucleobases to create a PNA.
We have filed patent applications in this category in the United States and pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
Methods of Producing Peptide Nucleic Acids with Modified Nucleobases
We have exclusively licensed a patent (with an estimated expiration date of April 11, 2034) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement disclosing a method of manufacturing a peptide nucleic acid oligomer containing a modified nucleobase.
Use of Peptide Nucleic Acids to Disrupt RNA Structure
We have exclusively licensed a provisional patent application (with an estimated expiration date of June 7, 2039) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement covering use of a peptide nucleic acid oligomer for disrupting a target RNA structure, to prevent translation of a target protein.
Use of Peptide Nucleic Acids to Treat Repeat Expansion Disorders
We have exclusively licensed patent applications (with an estimated expiration date of February 22, 2040) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement covering the use of a peptide nucleic acid oligomer for the treatment of repeat expansion disorders, including, for example, HD and DM1.



Patent Portfolio
We plan to seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each product to be developed. We also seek to maximize patent terms. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during the FDA regulatory review. The patent exclusivity period for a drug may deter generic drugs from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process. We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our field.
While we have obtained patents and have patent applications pending, the extent of effective patent protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain. No consistent policy addresses the breadth of claims allowed in or the degree of protection afforded under patents of medical and pharmaceutical companies. Patents we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors with similar technology. Any of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented.
The holders of competing patents could determine to commence a lawsuit against us and may even prevail in any such lawsuit. Litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us.
License Agreement with Carnegie Mellon University
On December 17, 2018, we entered into the CMU License Agreement. Under the CMU License Agreement, CMU granted us an exclusive, worldwide right to the PATrOL™ technology. Our exclusive, worldwide right to the PATrOL™ technology is subject to CMU’s right (which is exercisable only upon our written consent) to grant a non-exclusive license to a third party as a means of resolving disputes or to settle claims arising out of allegations that the licensed technology under the CMU License Agreement infringes upon the intellectual property rights of such third party.
As partial consideration for the license right, we issued and delivered to CMU 835,625 shares of our common stock. Further, as partial consideration for the license right, we issued a warrant to CMU, and CMU exercised such warrant prior to the effective time of the Merger for an aggregate of 103,787 shares of our common stock. Under the CMU License Agreement, CMU has preemptive rights with respect to certain future sales of securities by us for capital-raising purposes, “piggyback” registration rights and co-sale rights with respect to certain resales of shares by our stockholders.
Pursuant to the CMU License Agreement, we paid CMU a one-time payment of approximately $54,000 for patenting and other intellectual property protection costs incurred by CMU prior to the effective date of the CMU License Agreement and relating to the licensed technology thereunder. Further, we must achieve certain milestones to demonstrate certain developments of the licensed product. Further, subject to certain conditions, we will pay to CMU royalties at a low single-digit percentage of aggregate annual net sales of licensed products and a percentage at the higher range of the bottom third of sublicensing fees.
The term of the CMU License Agreement concludes at the end of 20 years from its effective date or on the expiration date of the last-to-expire patent licensed, whichever comes later, unless otherwise terminated. The CMU License Agreement may be terminated (or the exclusivity of the license may be terminated) before the term due to customary payment default and fundamental change default provisions and failure of performance obligations. In addition, CMU may terminate the CMU License Agreement if we or our affiliates challenge the validity of the intellectual property licensed thereunder in a judicial or administrative proceeding. In the event we or our affiliates successfully challenge the validity of the intellectual property licensed thereunder, the royalties payable to CMU increase by a single digit percentage. We may terminate the CMU License Agreement upon payment of termination fees, the amounts of which depend on the date of such termination, but only if at the time of such termination, a licensed patent contains a valid claim. If not earlier terminated, at the expiration of the term, the rights and licenses granted to us by CMU survive in perpetuity, subject to our compliance with indemnification and dispute resolution obligations.
Manufacturing
We currently manufacture our starting materials both in-house and by using third-party suppliers and our research-scale final products both in-house and externally. We intend to rely on third parties for larger scale manufacturing going forward. We currently contract 



for the manufacture of developmental quantities of our product candidates that we may develop. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.
Sales and Marketing
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for any of our future product candidates. Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives when it approaches approval for the use of our product candidates for one or more indications.
Competition
The biotechnology industry is highly competitive and involves a high degree of risk. Potential competitors in the United States and worldwide are numerous and include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, educational institutions and research foundations. We compete with many of these entities who, either alone or with their strategic partners, have far greater experience, capital resources, research and technical resources, marketing experience, clinical trial experience, and research and development staffs and facilities than we do. Some of our competitors may develop and commercialize products that compete directly with our product candidates, and they may introduce products to market earlier than our products or on a more cost-effective basis. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and also, in the future, in recruiting clinical trial sites and subjects for our clinical trials.
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their competing products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for any of our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
There are currently no approved treatments available to slow the progression of HD. Based on publicly available information, Roche and Ionis have an investigational drug in Phase III clinical development, and several companies have ongoing clinical and preclinical programs targeting the underlying disease in HD, including Wave Life Sciences, LTD., Sangamo Biosciences, ProQR, Nuredis, UniQure, Spark Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, Triplet Therapeutics, and Voyager Therapeutics. We are aware that a number of other companies are developing drugs focused on treating the symptoms associated with HD, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Phase II), Prana Biotechnology (Phase II), Omeros Corporation (Phase II), and Azevan Pharmaceuticals (Phase II), among others.
There are no disease-modifying treatments available for DM1. Based on publicly available information, we are aware of several companies actively pursuing preclinical and clinical development on various approaches to treat DM1 including AMO Pharma, Avidity Biosciences, Dyne Therapeutics, Vertex, Triplet Therapeutics, Expansion Therapeutics, and Nuredis.
Asset Purchase Agreement
On January 27, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement by and among us, NeuBase Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, and Vera Therapeutics, Inc. (“Vera”), as amended by the Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 20, 2021, by and between the Company and Vera (collectively, the “APA”). Pursuant to the terms of the APA, we acquired infrastructure, materials, and intellectual property for PNA scaffolds from Vera for total consideration of approximately $0.8 million in cash and 308,635 shares of common stock, with an aggregate fair value of $1.8 million (of which 146,375 were issued to Vera and 162,260 were to be held in escrow and released to Vera in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement between NeuBase Corporation and Vera) (the “Vera Acquisition”). The transaction closed on April 26, 2021.
Common Stock Offering
On April 26, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 9,200,000 shares of common stock (inclusive of 1,200,000 shares that were sold pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock), at a price to the 




public of $5.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $42.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by us. We have used and intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes and to advance the development of our product candidates and expand our pipeline.
Legacy NeuBase Pre-Merger Programs
We have an equity interest in DepYmed, Inc. (“DepYmed”), a joint venture that Ohr entered into with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 2014. DepYmed is a preclinical stage company focused on Wilson’s disease, Rett syndrome, and oncology applications. We also retain intellectual property, which has been licensed to DepYmed, and have no other ongoing obligations (monetary or otherwise) to DepYmed. In February 2021, the Company sold certain intellectual property to DepYmed in exchange for shares of Series A-4 preferred stock of DepYmed.
Governmental Regulation
Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Food and Drug Administration Regulation and Marketing Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) of a clinical hold on clinical trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practice or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), which are international ethical and scientific
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


quality standards meant to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected, and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and to assure clinical trial data integrity;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA approval of an NDA, which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IND and Clinical Trials
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an IND, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during drug development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:

● | Phase I - The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients in order to determine metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II - Clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III - When Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase III clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical sites may be undertaken. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase IV - The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These Phase IV clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with some of our product candidates, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.



Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The NDA Approval Process
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (exceeding $2.9 million in fiscal year 2021) unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II clinical trials, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase II clinical trials meetings to discuss their Phase II clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for the NDA sponsor’s manufacturing the product in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
The results of drug development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs within 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or effectiveness to an 



advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, Phase IV clinical trials, which are additional clinical trials performed after a product is approved. Phase IV clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”), which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the “review date” set forth under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) applicant to receive 



orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the United States, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Our initial two programs are targeting orphan indications.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Restoration
Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed by the NDA holder listed in the drug’s application or otherwise are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.



An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA (a “Section 505(b)(2) NDA”), which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
Market Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Post-Marketing Requirements.
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet, including social media. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval, or may include in a lengthy review process.
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, as amended, a part of the FDCA.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific, approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. NeuBase relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in 



enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase IV testing, REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly-discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products in development.
Reimbursement, Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The Medicare Modernization Act (“MMA”) established the Medicare Part D program (“Part D”) to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance), Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for product candidates for which NeuBase receives regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our product candidates covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a clinical trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of 



our product candidates, if approved. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be priced significantly lower than in the United States.
As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, or other good or service for which payment in whole or in part may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices or our future relationships with medical professionals might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize product candidates that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our product candidates, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a federal False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between currently $11,803 and $23,607 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a federal False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.



The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (1) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (2) additions or modifications to product labeling; (3) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (4) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

● | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of the average manufacturer prices (“AMP”) and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The CMS have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

● | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly-eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.

● | The PPACA imposes a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA imposes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to track this information and were required to make their first reports in March 2014. The information reported is publicly available on a searchable website. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2020.

Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and, at this time, the full effect of the PPACA on our business remains unclear. Further, there have been recent public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress, President Trump and his administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the PPACA. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which, among other things, eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage, effective January 1, 2019. We cannot predict the ultimate form or timing of any repeal or replacement of the PPACA or the effect such a repeal or replacement would have on our business.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the “BPCA”), certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a “Written Request”) relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would need to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with, and are responsive to, the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (the “PREA”), an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The PREA also authorizes the FDA to require holders of approved NDAs for marketed drugs to conduct pediatric studies under certain circumstances. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (the “FDASIA”), in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements 



and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
