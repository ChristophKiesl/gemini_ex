Company Overview
 We are a late-stage precision oncology company developing therapies that target oncogenic drivers for which we are able to genetically select patients we believe will be most likely to benefit. This approach includes using a tumor-agnostic strategy to select patients based on their tumors’ underlying genetics rather than histology. We have in-licensed product candidates, each with a differentiated profile relative to available therapies, and we intend to continue strengthening our pipeline through focused business development and internal research efforts.
 Our lead product candidate, milademetan (also known as RAIN-32) is a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), which may be oncogenic in numerous cancers. We in-licensed milademetan from Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo) in September 2020 based on the results of a Phase 1 clinical trial, which demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of liposarcoma (LPS) and other solid tumors. Data from well-differentiated/de-differentiated (WD/DD) LPS patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial of milademetan demonstrated median progression-free survival (mPFS) of approximately seven to eight months. Importantly, this result was accomplished with a rationally designed dosing schedule designed to mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition unlocking the potential for milademetan in a broad range of MDM2-dependent cancers. Milademetan is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with LPS (MANTRA), as well as a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors (MANTRA-2). We anticipate commencing a Phase 2 clinical trial of milademetan (MANTRA-3), for the treatment of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma who are polyoma virus-positive and refractory to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), in the second half of 2022 and a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of milademetan in combination with atezolizumab in patients with loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and wildtype p53 advanced solid tumors (MANTRA-4) in the second half of 2022. In addition to milademetan, we are also developing a preclinical program that is focused on inducing synthetic lethality in cancer cells by inhibiting RAD52.
 Our Strategy
 Our vision is to be a leading precision oncology company that develops and commercializes small molecule therapeutics through leveraging both an acquisition-based business model and internal research efforts. Our strategy to achieve this vision is as follows:

• | Rapidly advance our lead product candidate, milademetan, through clinical development toward approval in LPS and subsequently expand across a multitude of MDM2-dependent tumors. As the trials progress, we plan to accelerate efforts to engage with the regulatory authorities and, upon potential receipt of the requisite approvals, will initiate efforts to manufacture and commercially launch milademetan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase probability of a clinically meaningful benefit for patients for our pipeline programs by utilizing biomarker driven patient selection. We employ widely available, comprehensive next generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostic tests and partner with industry-leading assay developers to identify patients for our clinical trials based on molecular biomarkers indicating oncogene addiction and dependency on specific cellular signaling networks. This pre-selection of patients is designed to target patients most likely to benefit from our therapies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize opportunity of commercial success for our pipeline programs by focusing on tumor-agnostic clinical trials. Through our MANTRA-2 open-label basket trial for milademetan, we are employing a tumor-agnostic development approach to the essential biological pathways and molecular machinery of cancer. This strategy leverages existing comprehensive next generation tumor sequencing in cancer patients and we believe will allow for rapid patient enrollment and subsequent collection of data and, as a result, the potential acceleration of clinical trial timelines. We believe our continued focus on this approach will maximize our total addressable patient population and the overall commercial opportunities for our pipeline programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our business development expertise to expand our pipeline of precision oncology candidates by identifying genetically or biologically defined subsets across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies in patients with limited treatment options. Our team has a diversity of

backgrounds from academia and drug research and development to biopharma industry experience. Our expansive networks in the biopharma landscape coupled with our analytical approach to business development allows us to screen and identify drug candidates and programs with potentially significant commercial opportunities. We are exploring pipeline programs in the following three categories: (1) small molecule programs focusing on novel oncogenic drivers, and with mechanisms of action that are distinct from existing and upcoming therapeutics; (2) programs that improve upon existing therapies with validated oncology targets and clinical efficacy, but which lack clinical utility due to a narrow therapeutic window; and (3) programs targeting emerging classes and/or biological targets of precision oncology, such as synthetic lethality.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue global clinical and regulatory strategies enabling us to commercialize pipeline programs worldwide. We will pursue a global regulatory approach and take into consideration the differing requirements and criteria of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory agencies as our pipeline programs progress in their respective clinical trials. We plan to retain significant economic and commercial rights to our portfolio in the United States and certain other regions. We will evaluate partnership opportunities in regions in which we are unlikely to pursue commercialization on our own.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue collaborations with leading academic clinical investigators to evaluate new therapeutic indications and combinations of pipeline programs. In addition to building a pipeline of therapies through internal research and business development efforts, we expect to continue to partner with academic and research institutions to expand the scope of our data.

Overview of Precision Oncology and Our Approach
 Precision oncology broadly refers to the strategy of harnessing tumor biology to design drugs and clinical trial strategies to treat cancer more effectively in patients. Recent companion diagnostic approvals and reimbursement for multi-gene NGS assays have made it easier to translate and distil cancer biology into tenable biomarkers that can then be readily identified in tumor or blood samples from patients. This approach has accelerated over the last decade and has resulted in numerous targeted therapies for previously difficult to treat cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma, among others. A recent development within the precision oncology strategy is the strategy of seeking regulatory approval of cancer drugs based solely on tumor biology and biomarkers across cancer types, rather than tumor histology or organ site-specific approvals. Successful examples of this strategy include larotrectinib, developed by Loxo Oncology, Inc., and entrectinib, developed by Ignyta, Inc., both for tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions, and pembrolizumab, developed by Merck, for microsatellite instability-high tumors. As a result, a new era of cancer drug development has emerged, demonstrating an unprecedented degree of insight into the critical drivers of cancer, tumorigenesis and its associated signaling networks.
 With a biology-based approach that views a tumor’s biological driver as more important than tumor type for selecting treatment modalities, we believe that understanding the molecular machinery employed by a tumor is paramount to developing cancer therapeutics. We intend to pursue therapeutics that target genetic alterations in cell-signaling pathways that may be oncogenic, including synthetic lethal interactions. By understanding these biological dependencies in cancer cells, we hope to identify new therapies to meaningfully extend patients’ lives.
 We seek to build a pipeline of precision oncology therapeutics for genetically-defined patients by discovering or licensing programs in three categories:
  
• | programs focusing on novel oncogenic drivers and small molecules with mechanisms of action that are distinct from existing and upcoming therapeutics;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | programs that improve upon existing therapies with validated oncology targets and clinical efficacy, but which lack clinical utility due to a narrow therapeutic window; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | programs targeting emerging classes and/or biological targets of precision oncology, such as synthetic lethality.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Programs that capitalize on rational tumor targets are required to exhibit appropriate selectivity with a high degree of target engagement. We view the three key pillars of any successful program as:
  
• | targeting a tumor with unambiguous oncogenic addiction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | achieving sufficient exposure of therapeutics in plasma and the tumor; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2



 
• | strong target engagement during the dosing window.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Our approach leverages currently available tumor genetic testing strategies to enroll and treat patients with advanced cancer. We employ companion diagnostics and partnerships with industry-leading assay developers to identify patients based on molecular biomarkers indicating oncogene addiction and dependency on specific cellular signaling networks. In our MANTRA-2 basket trial of milademetan, we are enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic cancer based on MDM2 gene amplification and p53 mutation status, both of which are widely available on existing commercial NGS assays. The significant expansion of the FDA-approved targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma and tumor-agnostic indications has led to increasing adoption of multi-gene NGS assays to determine patient eligibility for an ever-expanding number of targeted therapies.
 Our Development Pipeline
 Our development pipeline is summarized below and is unified by a strategy to target oncogenic drivers through differentiated therapies for which we are able to genetically select the patients we believe will be most likely to benefit from treatment. We currently retain global development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.
Our Lead Product Candidate, Milademetan
 Milademetan Overview
 Our lead product candidate, milademetan, is a small molecule, oral inhibitor of MDM2 and is being developed in patients with MDM2-dependent cancers. Historically, MDM2 inhibition has presented treatment challenges due to dose-limiting, on-target hematologic toxicities. We believe an MDM2-targeted therapy must possess certain pharmacological characteristics related to potency, pharmacokinetics and drug accumulation to allow for the design of an optimized dosing schedule. An optimized dosing schedule is intended to improve peak drug exposure leading to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest during the dosing period, while permitting hematopoietic precursor cell recovery during the dosing break, thereby minimizing hematologic toxicity. Residual drug concentration, due to poor drug clearance or tissue accumulation during the dosing break may otherwise prevent recovery from thrombocytopenia. Milademetan’s differentiated profile, as a potent MDM2 inhibitor with rapid plasma clearance and lack of drug accumulation in tissues, has enabled a rationally designed dosing schedule that we believe has the potential to reduce toxicities while preserving activity. We anticipate that this dosing schedule may also be applicable to other MDM2-dependent cancer populations across solid and hematologic tumor types.
 Overview of p53 and MDM2
 Milademetan reactivates p53, known as the “guardian of the genome,” by inhibiting MDM2. p53 is present in every cell and acts as a key regulator of a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. In a normal cell, the activity of p53 is controlled and regulated by the inhibitory protein MDM2. MDM2 
 
3


binds to p53, thereby inducing degradation and allowing normal cells to function properly. In response to cell damage and other stress conditions, p53 is activated and prevents the formation of cancerous cells by inducing apoptosis.
 In contrast to normal cells, in tumor cells, the two primary mechanisms by which p53 can be inactivated in tumor cells are mutations in p53 and activation or overexpression of MDM2. Approximately half of all tumors are characterized by mutations of the p53 gene. The remaining cancer patients have a p53 gene that is not mutated, and is otherwise known as WT p53, but can be functionally suppressed through the activation or overexpression of MDM2. We have identified MDM2 dependence in several solid tumors. This dependence is caused by overexpression of MDM2 through gene amplification or other mechanisms, loss of a negative regulator of MDM2 or other causes. Overexpression of MDM2 promotes the degradation of p53 and also eliminates p53’s ability to activate transcription. Milademetan, by binding MDM2 at the p53 interaction site, prevents the formation of the MDM2- p53 complex, allowing p53 reactivation and subsequent transcription of genes, such as MIC-1, that trigger cancer cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, among others.
 
Phase 1 Clinical Data
 Milademetan has been evaluated by Daiichi Sankyo in various solid tumors, including WD/DD LPS, in a Phase 1 trial (U101) for initial assessment of safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy. The largest population enrolled in the trial were WD/DD LPS patients (approximately 50% of the total patients enrolled). WD/DD LPS tumors have nearly universal MDM2 gene amplification and WT p53, and hence are nearly universally MDM2-dependent. Therefore, we believe these LPS patients represent an appropriate population for MDM2 inhibition therapy. In October 2020, Daiichi Sankyo reported comprehensive results from this Phase 1 trial covering 107 patients. Milademetan has demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of LPS and other solid tumors in a Phase 1 clinical trial, validating a rationally-designed dosing schedule to potentially mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition.
 
Clinical Observations to Support Pursuing Milademetan as a Treatment in LPS Patients
 Historically, LPS treatment rarely produces tumor responses, regardless of therapy and line of treatment. As a result, efficacy in LPS has been assessed with an endpoint of PFS, and we are using PFS as the primary endpoint in our MANTRA Phase 3 LPS trial. Notwithstanding, tumor responses to milademetan were observed in the Phase 1 trial. Of the 53 patients with WD/DD LPS who received one or more doses of milademetan, two (3.8%) achieved partial response and 34 (64.2%) achieved stable disease.
 The trial also identified the disease control rate (DCR) for the LPS population enrolled in the trial, which consisted primarily of patients with MDM2-amplified tumors, as compared to an unselected non-LPS population. The DCR in the LPS population was nearly double the DCR in the non-LPS population, 58.5% versus 32.4%, respectively, supporting our plan to select patients with MDM2 amplification in future clinical trials.
 In July 2021, we provided an update on patients who received milademetan monotherapy from the concluded Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study. As of July 1, 2021, three WD/DD LPS patients received therapy with milademetan monotherapy for greater than 51 months. Two of these patients received therapy with durations of 51 and 57 months without disease progression, and an additional patient received therapy for greater than 59 months before discontinuation in the second quarter of 2021. We believe this highlights the potential for milademetan to have a favorable long-term tolerability and safety profile.
 Based on the Phase 1 data, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 trial in WD/DD LPS patients (MANTRA) in July 2021.
 
Clinical Observations in Non-LPS Patients to Support Pursuing Milademetan as a Tumor-agnostic Treatment for Patients with MDM2-amplified Tumors
 In contrast to LPS patients who rarely have tumor responses to treatment, certain non-LPS patients enrolled in the Phase 1 trial exhibited tumor responses when treated with milademetan. Of the ten non-LPS patients receiving milademetan in Schedule D of the completed Phase 1 clinical trial, three patients were characterized for MDM2 gene amplification. Patients characterized for MDM2 gene amplification included patients with breast cancer (copy number of 16.8), synovial sarcoma (copy number of 25.9) and small cell lung cancer 
 
4


(SCLC) (copy number of 36.6). The first patient exhibited a confirmed tumor volume reduction. The latter two patients exhibited partial responses, one of which was a confirmed partial response.
 Based on the available data from patients with non-LPS MDM2-amplified tumors, we initiated a Phase 2 tumor agnostic basket clinical trial (MANTRA-2) in November 2021.
 Clinical Development Plan
 Phase 3 Trial in WD/DD LPS Patients (MANTRA)
 In July 2021, we initiated a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registrational trial (MANTRA) for patients with unresectable or metastatic DD LPS with or without a WD LPS component that has progressed on one or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one anthracycline-based therapy. This trial is an open label, 1:1 randomized trial comparing milademetan to trabectedin, an SOC therapeutic, in approximately 160 WD/DD LPS patients with at least one prior anthracycline-based therapy. The dosing schedule for the Phase 3 trial will be identical to the Schedule D dose of 260 mg (qd 3/14x2) employed in the Phase 1 trial. The primary objective of the trial is to compare PFS evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in blinded independent review between the milademetan treatment arm and the trabectedin control arm. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and patient reported outcomes. We anticipate top-line data from this trial in 2023. Our commencement of a Phase 3 trial following the Phase 1 trial referenced above is based on the data observed in the Phase 1 trial and FDA feedback with respect to our development plan.
 The PFS assumptions for statistical powering are based on a PFS assumption for the control arm of 3.0 months and 6.0 months for milademetan. The doubling of PFS corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.5.
 Phase 2 MDM2-amplified Tumor-agnostic Basket Trial (MANTRA-2)
 In November 2021, the first patient was dosed in the multicenter, single arm, open-label, Phase 2 basket trial evaluating Milademetan for the treatment of MDM2-amplified advanced solid (MANTRA-2). The MANTRA-2 trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of milademetan in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors refractory or intolerant to standard-of-care therapy and that exhibit wild-type p53 and a prespecified minimum MDM2 gene copy number. Approximately 65 patients are anticipated to be enrolled to receive milademetan. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate as measured by RECIST criteria. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate progression-free survival by investigator assessment, overall survival, and growth modulation index. An interim analysis from MANTRA-2 is anticipated in the second half of 2022. 
 We are enrolling patients that have received and progressed on standard of care (SOC) therapy and will be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from SOC therapy. Patients with MDM2 amplification will be selected using a commercially-available NGS-based diagnostic assay. Milademetan will be administered in doses of 260 mg using the Schedule D dosing schedule from the Phase 1 trial (qd 3/14x2). The primary endpoint of this trial will be ORR by RECIST, with secondary endpoints of PFS, Duration of Response (DOR), OS and growth-modulation index (GMI). We believe the basket trial is supported by data in the Phase 1 clinical trial, in which non-LPS patients with MDM2-amplified tumors exhibited tumor volume reductions and confirmed partial responses under RECIST criteria.
 Phase 2 Trial for Milademetan in Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MANTRA-3)
 An oncogenic Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCV) presents in approximately 80% of MCC tumors. MCV-positive MCC typically contains mutant retinoblastoma and WT p53. Inactivating mutations in p53 have rarely been found in MCC. MCV small T antigen functions as a transcriptional activator to increase levels of MDM2 and downregulate p53 levels. Notably, other MDM2 programs have demonstrated proof-of-concept in MCC with clinical responses. Other MDM2 inhibitors have demonstrated potent activity in virus-positive, WT p53 MCC cancer models, albeit with high toxicity due to a narrow therapeutic window.
 Based on recent non-clinical data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute presented at the Triple Cancer Conference, we announced a plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial, named MANTRA-3, evaluating the efficacy of milademetan, an oral MDM2 inhibitor, as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with MCC refractory to ICI. The MANTRA-3 trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of milademetan, as a monotherapy in patients with MCC that have progressed on immune checkpoint inhibitors. Approximately 34 patients are expected to be enrolled to receive milademetan. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate as 
 
5


measured by RECIST criteria. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, progression free survival by investigator assessment, growth modulation index, overall survival and safety.
 Phase 1 Trial for Milademetan in Combination with Atezolizumab in Patients with CDKN2A Loss and Wildtype p53 advanced solid tumors. 
 Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) encodes for the tumor suppressor p14ARF, an inhibitor of MDM2, and the loss of CDKN2A may lead to MDM2-dependent cancers. This concept of MDM2 dependency is supported by nonclinical data demonstrating in vitro sensitivity to milademetan of cancer cell lines harboring CDKN2A loss and WT p53 as well as several in vivo models with CDKN2A loss showing anti-tumor activity of milademetan. Loss of p53 activity via MDM2 and/or CDKN2A loss has also been associated with poor clinical outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Nonclinical data in an immune competent mouse model of colorectal cancer with CDKN2A loss demonstrated enhanced combinatorial activity of milademetan plus an anti-PD1 antibody compared to either agent alone.
 In January 2022, we announced a clinical supply agreement with Roche for the supply of the anti-Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, atezolizumab. Clinical trials are planned to evaluate milademetan in combination with atezolizumab for the treatment of patients in genetically selected populations. Under this agreement, we are the sponsor of the anticipated clinical trials, and Roche will supply atezolizumab.
 An initial Phase 1 clinical trial is planned to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of milademetan in combination with atezolizumab in patients with loss of CDKN2A and wildtype p53 advanced solid tumors who have previously progressed on ICI. We anticipate the start of the Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2022. Subsequent Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating the combination of milademetan and atezolizumab may span various additional tumor types.
 Preclinical RAD52 Program
 We are also developing a preclinical program focused on targeting RAD52 in the DNA damage repair pathway. While our RAD52 program is in an early stage of development, we expect to develop this program for patients with a molecularly diagnosed HRD+, such as mutations and loss-of-function in BRCA1/2 or others that utilize RAD52 as an alternative DNA repair pathway, as well as for patients that may have relapsed to poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy. There are currently no approved therapies or clinical programs in development targeting RAD52.
 Targeting RAD52 represents a novel strategy for tumors exhibiting tumor HRD+ or a loss of function, of several pathway constituents, including BRCA1/2 or others in tumor types frequently characterized by these deficiencies. These tumors include breast, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian and possibly other cancers. Developmental paths for RAD52 inhibitors include as a monotherapy in HRD+ patients relapsing on PARP inhibitor therapy, or in front-line combinations with PARP inhibitors in HRD+ tumors.
 Our RAD52 program is currently in lead optimization stage. We anticipate evaluating identified RAD52 inhibitor candidates in animal models of patient tumors with HRD+ that have relapsed on PARP inhibitors and in HRD+ tumors with a loss-of-function mutation of BRCA1/2 in combination with PARP inhibitors.

 Unless earlier terminated or extended, the term of the Drexel License Agreement with respect to any licensed product and country continues until the later of (i) the expiration or abandonment of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patent rights that covers the sale of such licensed product in such country, (ii) the expiration of any granted statutory period of marketing and/or data exclusivity for such licensed product pursuant to which we have exclusive commercialization rights, (iii) the month of the first sale of a generic equivalent of such licensed product in such country and (iv) ten years after the first sale of the first licensed product.
 We may terminate the Drexel License Agreement at any time by providing 60 days’ prior written notice to Drexel, in which case we will be required to cease exploitation of all licensed products, terminate all permitted sublicenses and pay all amounts owed to Drexel under the Drexel License Agreement and the Sponsored Research Agreement through the effective date of termination. Drexel may terminate the Drexel License Agreement for our uncured material breach (with 30-135 day cure periods), for our bankruptcy or insolvency, for our uncured material default under the Sponsored Research Agreement, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the licensed patent rights.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize.
 Clinical drug product supplies and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for the milademetan program were produced and supplied to us by Daiichi Sankyo. Clinical drug product manufactured in Daiichi Sankyo’s GMP production facilities was supplied to us as brite stock and is being used in our ongoing LPS trial and basket

trial. For the milademetan program, we have selected and transferred Daiichi Sankyo processes to suitable commercial contract manufacturing organizations to supply API and clinical drug product for our clinical trials and in preparation for submission of marketing applications and potential future commercial supplies.
 We obtain our supplies from contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for APIs and drug product. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the APIs and drug product for our future development plan for milademetan. All our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 Manufacturing clinical products is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our contract manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements which impose certain production, manufacturing, procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP requirements and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing, obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, including milademetan, their methods of use, related technologies, such as biomarkers, solid state forms, formulations, etc. and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field.
 Our future commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our drug candidates and other commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our intellectual property, in particular, our patent rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
 The patent positions for biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also cannot ensure that patents will be issued with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We generally file patent applications directed to our key programs in an effort to secure our intellectual property positions vis-a-vis these programs. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or in-licensed eighteen U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. patent application, one hundred and fifteen foreign patents, two allowed foreign patent applications, six U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications, fifty-three foreign pending patent applications, and five pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications.

The intellectual property portfolio for our most advanced programs as of December 31, 2021, is summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices may be significantly narrowed before issuance, if issued at all. We expect this may be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below.
 Milademetan
 With regard to milademetan, as of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio contained fourteen issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, ninety-seven issued foreign patents, and thirty-four pending foreign patent applications, all exclusively licensed from Daiichi Sankyo. One patent family in the milademetan portfolio is directed to the composition of matter of milademetan where we have issued patents in various jurisdictions including the United States, Japan, thirty-seven countries in Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Indonesia, India, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam and pending patent applications in various jurisdictions including the United States, Brazil, Egypt, and Thailand, all of which are expected to expire in March 2032, excluding potential patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, where applicable. Another patent family supporting milademetan pertains to crystal-forms of milademetan. Under this patent family, we have eight issued U.S. patents and thirteen issued foreign patents in various jurisdictions including Japan, certain countries in Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Russia and Taiwan, and pending patent applications in Brazil and India all of which are expected to expire in 2033, excluding potential patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, where applicable.
 Furthermore, we exclusively licensed from Daiichi Sankyo five patent families directed to combination therapies with milademetan, methods of synthesis of milademetan, and dosing regimens of Milademetan within these five patent families, we have five issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, twenty-three issued foreign patents and twenty-six pending foreign patent applications, including in Japan, Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Korea, India, Brazil and Taiwan, all of which are expected to expire between September 2034 and October 2037, excluding potential patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, where applicable. These combination therapy, method of synthesis, and method of use (dosing regimen) patents and patent applications will not present barriers to our competitors with respect to any unclaimed therapies or methods of synthesis or use involving milademetan.
 We intend to pursue additional patent protection for milademetan and other development candidates relating to milademetan, its methods of use and related technologies that we consider important to our business.
 RAD52
 With regard to our RAD52 program, as of December 31, 2021, we exclusively licensed from Drexel two patent families directed to compositions of matter RAD52 inhibitors and their use in the treatment of cancer. One of the patent families comprises two issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, all of which are expected to expire in June 2036, excluding potential patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, where applicable. The second patent family comprises one PCT application. Patents that issue, if any, and claim priority to this PCT application will be expected to expire in October 2040, excluding potential patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. We intend to pursue additional patent protection for our RAD52 program and other development candidates relating to our RAD52 inhibitor, its methods of use and related technologies that we consider important to our business.
 Patent Terms
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act) as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering milademetan, RAD52 or our 
 
10


preclinical programs, if issued, and products from our intellectual property may or will be entitled to patent term extensions. If our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved use or the drug candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 Protection of Proprietary Information
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection and confidential know-how for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our manufacturing processes. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our confidential information, as well as entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, contract manufacturers, contract research organizations (CROs), hospitals, independent treatment centers, suppliers, collaborators and other third parties, such parties may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection. Third parties may also independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulations
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state, local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. All of our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our research and development activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA and other government entities regulate drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the United States at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, issuance of warning letters and other types of regulatory letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, refusals of or debarment from government contracts, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil or criminal investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General, and/or other agencies, False Claims Act suits and/or other litigation, and/or criminal prosecutions.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States must typically undertake the following:
  
(1) | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations or other applicable regulations;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | submission to the FDA of an IND Application for human clinical testing, which must become effective without FDA objection before human clinical trials may begin;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11


 
(4) | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for each indication for which approval is sought;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA);
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | satisfactory review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable,
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(7) | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | payment of user fees, as applicable, and securing FDA review approval of the NDA.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and an IND
 Preclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. Some preclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND, such as restrictions on dosing or patient enrollment. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume in full or in part, as applicable, after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB or ethics committee representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
12


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently $3,117,218 for fiscal year 2022, for applications requiring clinical data, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently $369,413 for fiscal year 2022. These fees are adjusted annually.
 
13


Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third-party controls, or has the power to control, both entities. In addition, an application to market a prescription drug product that has received orphan designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Specifically, the FDA has a goal of reviewing most NDAs for new molecular entities within ten months from the date of filing, and of reviewing most “priority review” NDAs within six months of the filing date. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and clinical sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical or nonclinical testing or other information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months of receipt depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. After approval, the FDA may seek to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the 
 
14


results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. Some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation entitles the applicant to incentives such as grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and waivers of FDA user fees. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA, and both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act and FDA’s implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 316. The granting of an orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval.
 After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track Designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. .
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 established the Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track Designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy Designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated 
 
15


approval. NDAs for drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions may be eligible for priority review where there is evidence that the product candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition.
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval for an NDA if the drug treats a serious or life-threatening condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on ongoing or planned clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of 
 
16


the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a drug candidate depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the drug or new indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, 
 
17


diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (PMA).
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time -consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 In order to market any pharmaceutical product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, clinical trials, marketing authorization, packaging, storage, record keeping, reporting, export and import, advertising and other promotional practices involving pharmaceutical products, as well as commercial sales, distribution and post-approval monitoring and reporting of our products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a pharmaceutical product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the pharmaceutical product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, as evidenced by the preliminary feedback from the EMA on the design of our planned Phase 3 liposarcoma trial. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer and far more difficult than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

The United Kingdom (UK) formally left the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU laws continued to apply to the UK, expired on December 31, 2020. This means EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Following the end of the transition period, the EU and the UK concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (TCA), which applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021.
 The TCA includes provisions affecting the life sciences sector (including on customs and tariffs) but areas for further discussion between the EU and the UK remain. In addition, there are some specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals. These include the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and issued GMP documents. The TCA does not, however, contain wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards.
 Since January 1, 2021, the EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable in the UK as “retained EU law”. As there is no general power to amend these regulations, the UK government has enacted the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021. The purpose of the act is to enable the existing regulatory frameworks in relation to human medicines, clinical trials of human medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices to be updated. The powers under the act may only be exercised in relation to specified matters and must safeguard public health.
 Specified provisions of the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 entered into force on February 11, 2021. The remaining provisions came into effect within two months of February 11, 2021 or will otherwise come into effect as stipulated in subsequent statutory instruments. The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 supplements the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (UK Regulations), which are based on the EU Medical Devices Directive as amended to reflect the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime. Notably, the UK Regulations do not include any of the revisions that have been made by the EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745, which, since May 26, 2021, now applies in all EU Member States. 
 The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) conducted a comprehensive consultation between September and November 2021 on proposals to develop a new UK regime for medical devices in the UK. The proposals include more closely aligning definitions for medical devices and in vitro medical devices with internationally recognized definitions and changing the classification of medical devices according to levels or risk. The proposals are intended to improve patient and public safety and increase the appeal of the UK market. The new regime is planned to come into force on July 1, 2023, which will align with the date from which the UK is due to stop accepting CE marked medical devices and require UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking. It is envisaged that, in Northern Ireland, the amended regime could run in parallel with any existing or future EU rules in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.
 Drug Development Process
 The conduct of clinical trials is currently governed by the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive), and will be gradually replaced by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (CTR). The CTR introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. It entered into force on January 31, 2022.
 Under the current regime, which will expire after a transition period of one or three years, respectively, as outlined below in more detail, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The approval must be obtained from two separate entities: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCA of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur.
 A more unified procedure applies under the new CTR. A sponsor is able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) takes the lead in validating and evaluating the application consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances 
 
19


declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial form being conducted in such Member State. The CTR also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. After several postponements of the coming into effect of the CTR due to technical difficulties with the underlying IT systems, the “go live” of these systems and, accordingly, the coming into force of the regulation, took place on January 31, 2022. While Member States will work in CTIS immediately after the system has gone live, the CTR provides for two transition periods for sponsors: For one year, until 31 January 2023, clinical trial sponsors can still choose whether to submit an initial clinical trial application in line with the current system (Clinical Trials Directive) or via CTIS. From 31 January 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via CTIS becomes mandatory, and by 31 January 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the current Clinical Trials Directive will be governed by the new Regulation and have to be transitioned to CTIS.
 Under both the current regime and the new CTR, national laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 During the development of a pharmaceutical product, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP). A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, but is significantly reduced for designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorization Procedures
 In the EU and in Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein (together, the European Economic Area or EEA), pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA).
 Marketing Authorizations have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity in the European Union that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the pharmaceutical product has already received an MA) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market.
 New medicinal products authorized in the European Union, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period of market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference medicinal product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the European Union until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the European Union.
 
20


Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. The EMA grants Orphan Drug Designation if the medicinal product is intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition (prevalence criterion). In addition, Orphan Drug Designation can be granted if, for economic reasons, the medicinal product would be unlikely to be developed without incentives and if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed medicinal product is a significant benefit to patients affected by the condition. An application for orphan drug designation (which is not a marketing authorization, as not all orphan-designated medicines reach the authorization application stage) must be submitted first before an application for marketing authorization of the medicinal product is submitted. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted, and sponsors must submit an annual report to EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Designated orphan medicines are eligible for conditional marketing authorization.
 The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) reassesses the Orphan Drug Designation of a product in parallel with the review for a marketing authorization; for a product to benefit from market exclusivity it must maintain its Orphan Drug Designation at the time of marketing authorization review by the EMA and approval by the EC. Additionally, any marketing authorization granted for an orphan medicinal product must only cover the therapeutic indication(s) that are covered by the Orphan Drug Designation. Upon the grant of a marketing authorization, Orphan Drug Designation provides up to ten years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States and the EMA may not accept applications for marketing authorization, accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication. Conversely, the ten-year market exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer fulfils the criteria for an Orphan Drug Designation.
 Pediatric Development
 In the EU, companies developing a new pharmaceutical product are obligated to study their product in children and must therefore submit a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) together with a request for agreement to the EMA. Pharmaceutical products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the approved PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan pharmaceutical products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the approved PIP are developed and submitted. An approved PIP is also required when a marketing authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights.
Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 In Europe, in vitro diagnostic medical devices are currently regulated by Directive 98/79/EC which regulates the placing on the market, the CE-marking, the essential requirements, the conformity assessment procedures, the registration obligations for manufactures and devices as well as the vigilance procedure. In vitro diagnostic medical devices must comply with the requirements provided for in the Directive, and with further requirements implemented at national level (as the case may be). The Directive 98/79/EC will be replaced by the Regulation on In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices (No. 2017/746), which will apply from 26 May 2022, following a five-year transition period. In the meantime, manufacturers can opt to place in-vitro diagnostic devices on the market under Directive 98/79/EC or under the new Regulation if they fully comply with it.
 Companion diagnostics can also be considered “combination products” which are governed by a different regulatory pathway depending on the mode of action of the products. A combination medicine/device product could either be regulated as a medicinal product or a medical device based on its primary mode of action. In principle, if a medical device incorporates a substance which, if used separately, is likely to be considered as a 
 
21


medicinal product and act on the human body by an action ancillary to that of the device, the device must be evaluated and authorized in accordance with the medical device regulations. However, if the medicinal substance constitutes the main function of the product, then the product is considered as a medicinal product. Currently, for such combination products, the manufacturer will have to consult, prior to obtaining the CE marking of the device, the EMA or NCA to obtain scientific advice on the quality and safety of the medicinal substance, including the benefit/risk profile of its incorporation into the device.
 The regulation of companion diagnostics will be subject to further requirements as of the entry into force of the in-vitro diagnostic devices Regulation (No 2017/746) which introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the centralized procedure, or a marketing authorization application for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a NCA or the EMA.
 Post-approval Regulation
 Similar to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU Member States.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a pharmaceutical product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of pharmaceutical products.
 Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the EU Member State laws implementing Directive 2001/83/EC on pharmaceutical products for human use and other core legislation relating to pharmaceutical products, and other EU Member State laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal, or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Advertising and Promotion
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU regulation. This includes but is not limited to the promotion of pharmaceutical products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at EU level and in the individual EU Member States may apply. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with healthcare professionals. For instance, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the EU. Relationships with healthcare professionals and associations are subject to stringent anti-gift statutes and anti-bribery laws, the scope of which differs across the EU. In addition, payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the authorities of the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Pricing and Reimbursement Environment
 Even if a pharmaceutical product obtains a marketing authorization in the European Union, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The EU Member 
 
22


States are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
 To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, including the EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local SOC. There can be no assurance that any country will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that we will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.
 European Union Data Laws
 The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States.
 The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (processing includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data of individuals within the European Union and in the EEA, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also impose additional requirements in relation to health, genetic and biometric data through their national implementing legislation.
 Under the GDPR, personal data can only be transferred within the EU Member States and the three additional European Economic Area countries (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) that have adopted a national law implementing the GDPR. Appropriate safeguards are required to enable cross-border transfers of personal data from the EU and EEA Member States to a “third country” (a country outside the EU or EEA). This status has a number of significant practical consequences, in particular for international data transfers, competent supervisory authorities and enforcement of the GDPR.
 In conclusion, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Union /EEA (including the United States) that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, except if the data controller meets very specific requirements such as the use of standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”), issued by the European Commission. In this respect recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EU/EEA. For example, following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 16, 2020, in which the Court invalidated the Privacy Shield under which personal data could be transferred from the EU/EEA to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme, there is uncertainty as to the general permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. The Court did not invalidate the then current SCCs, but ruled that data exporters relying on these SCCs are required to verify, on a case-by-case basis, if the law of the third country ensures an adequate level of data protection that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the EU/EEA. In light of the implications of this decision we may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the European Union/EEA to third countries. However, on June 4, 2021 the EU Commission issued a new set of SCCs for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA. These SCCs replace the old sets of SCCs that were adopted under the previous European Data Protection Directive 95/46. Since September 27, 2021, it is no longer possible to conclude contracts incorporating these previous versions of the SCCs. In addition, for contracts concluded before September 27, 2021, it is still possible to rely on the previous SCCs until the end of an additional 15 months transitional period (until December 27, 2022), provided that the processing operations which are the subject matter of the contract remain unchanged and reliance on previous SCCs ensures that the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards. On November 11, 2021, the European Data Protection Board has adopted recommendations on such appropriate safeguards that supplement transfer mechanisms. These recommendations aim to assist data exporters with their duty to identify and implement appropriate supplementary measures where they are needed to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection to the personal data they transfer to third countries.
 
23


Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses (punishable by uncapped fines) for organizations and in certain cases their directors and officers as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. Guidance developed at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
 There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the European Union which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives and voluntary commitments by industry. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation and the GDPR, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
 With regard to the transfer of data from the European Union to the United Kingdom, the TCA provided for a transition period of up to six months as of January 1, 2021 to enable the European Commission to complete its adequacy assessment of the UK’s data protection laws. On June 28, 2021 the European Commission adopted two adequacy decisions for the United Kingdom – one under the GDPR and the other for the Law Enforcement Directive. Personal data may now freely flow from the European Union to the United Kingdom since the United Kingdom is deemed to have an adequate data protection level. Additionally, following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union and the EEA, companies also have to comply with the UK’s data protection laws (including the UK GDPR, which is based on the EU GDPR), the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The adequacy decisions include a ‘sunset clause’ which entails that the decisions will automatically expire four years after their entry into force.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the European Union, its Member States and other states of Europe that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. In addition to new legislation, pharmaceutical regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the EMA and national agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not necessarily imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval 
 
24


as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, risk sharing, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time.
 In particular, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law and contained provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increasing rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extending Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, requiring mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and imposing annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case, but overturned the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing and did not address the constitutionality. The Supreme Court’s decision left open the opportunity for additional challenges to the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships

through which we market, sell and distribute products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
  
• | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any item, facility or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits, among other things, U.S. corporations and persons acting on their behalf from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official (including certain healthcare professionals in many countries), political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise seek preferential treatment abroad;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act, which may be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice or private whistleblowers to bring civil actions (qui tam actions) on behalf of the federal government, imposes civil penalties, as well as liability for treble damages and for attorneys’ fees and costs, on individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, making a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Department of Health and Human Services’ Civil Monetary Penalties authorities, which imposes administrative sanctions for, among other things, presenting or causing to be presented false claims for government payment and providing remuneration to government health program beneficiaries to influence them to order or receive healthcare items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other conduct, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes criminal and civil liability and penalties on those who violate requirements, including mandatory contractual terms, intended to safeguard the privacy, security, transmission and use of individually identifiable health information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute relating to healthcare matters prohibits falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs (among other products) to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by statute), certain other healthcare providers beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the reporting manufacturers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | certain state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with voluntary compliance guidelines promulgated by a pharmaceutical industry association and relevant compliance guidance issues by HHS Office of Inspector General; bar drug manufacturers from offering or providing certain types of payments or gifts to physicians and other health care providers; and/or require disclosure of gifts or payments to physicians and other healthcare providers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26


 
• | Various state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances; many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Competition
 The biotechnology industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, ranging in size from early stage to major global companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop cancer therapies. We focus on the development of precision small molecule therapies for patients with cancers where there is a high unmet medical need. There are numerous other companies that have commercialized or are developing cancer therapies for the same or similar targets.
 With respect to our lead product candidate, milademetan, there are no approved drugs targeting MDM2. There are multiple companies testing MDM2 inhibitors and degraders in various stages of development and various indications, including, Kartos (navtemadlin), Ascentage (alrizomadlin), Boehringer Ingelheim (BI-907828), Aileron (ALRN-6924), Kymera (KT-253), and others.
 With respect to our RAD52 program, there are currently no other approved or clinical-stage therapeutics that inhibit RAD52. We are aware of academic groups working on discovery-stage RAD52 programs; however, we believe that our RAD52 program is currently the most advanced program for this target.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunities if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or obtain more favorable reimbursement than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 44 full-time employees, of whom 31 were engaged in research and development activities and 13 were engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Recruiting and retaining experienced and qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work now and in the future will be critical to our business success. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among pharmaceutical and 
 
27


biotechnology companies, academic and research institutions and government agencies for experienced scientists.
 Our values—relentless, energetic, and committed to excellence—guide how we make decisions, and treat each other. All employees are responsible for upholding these values, the Rain Code of Conduct, and Employee Handbook form the foundation of our policies and practices and ethical business culture.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees.
 Inclusion
 Diversity and inclusion are instrumental in driving innovation and delivering stronger business growth. Among our 44 full-time employees, 48% are women. Over 21 languages are spoken by our employees and they hail from many countries around the world.
Compensation and Benefits
 We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. Our total rewards package includes market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave, and flexible work schedules.
Growth and Development
 We are dedicated to helping each employee take charge to lead, and to grow professionally and personally. Through our regular self-evaluation, goal setting and performance review, employees can voice learning and development experiences. 
Health and Safety
 We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees, and all other individuals working on our behalf.
 Throughout our response to COVID-19, our priority has remained protecting the health and safety of our employees and other parties. Most of our employees are working remotely. We will continue to monitor the evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business. In response to COVID-19, we continue to take the following safety measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate:

• | allow employees to work remotely where feasible; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | restrict company travel to essential business travel that requires prior multi-level approvals
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Matters
 We are committed to operating our business in a manner that protects the environment as much as possible, and are further committed to compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and industry best practices, such as those that affect hazardous waste disposal, emissions, and water purity. 
Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 6, 2017. Our corporate offices are located at 8000 Jarvis Avenue, Suite 204, Newark, California 94560 and our telephone number is (510) 953-5559. Our website address is www.rainthera.com. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is an inactive textual reference only.
 We file electronically with the SEC our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). We make available on our website at www.rainthera.com, under “Investors,” free of charge, copies of these reports as soon

as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing these reports with the SEC. The reports that we file or furnished to SEC can be obtained electronically by means of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including relief from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, less extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, and exemptions from stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may also elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important and the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than, and not comparable to, information presented by other public reporting companies. We could remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (IPO), (2) the last day of the year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company may therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as are required of other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financial information to those of other public companies more difficult.
 We are also a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
