Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
 Owl Rock Capital Corporation III is a Maryland corporation formed on January 27, 2020. We are focused primarily on originating and making loans to, and debt and equity investments in middle-market companies based primarily in the United States. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company’s common equity. Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. While we believe that current market conditions favor extending credit to middle market companies in the United States, our investment strategy is intended to generate favorable returns across credit cycles with an emphasis on preserving capital.
 We define “middle market companies” to generally mean companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) between $10 million and $250 million annually, and/or annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets, including the high yield and syndicated loan markets. We generally intend to invest in companies with a low loan-to-value ratio, which we consider to be 50% or below. Our target credit investments will typically have maturities between three and ten years and generally range in size between $20 million and $250 million. The investment size will vary with the size of our capital base. 
 We expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include “covenant-lite” loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to our shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates.
 We are advised by the Adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. The Adviser is an indirect subsidiary of Owl Rock Capital Partners LP (“Owl Rock Capital Partners”). To achieve our investment objective, we will leverage the Adviser’s investment team’s extensive network of relationships with other sophisticated institutions to source, evaluate and, as appropriate, partner with on transactions. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objective.
 Since our Adviser’s affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2020, our Adviser or its affiliates have originated $27.7 billion aggregate principal amount of investments across multiple industries, of which $25.8 billion of aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates. 
 As of December 31, 2020, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 72.1% first lien senior secured debt investments, 20.9% second lien senior secured debt investments, 4.8% unsecured debt investments, and 2.2% equity investments. As of December 31, 2020, 98.9% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. As of December 31, 2020 we had investments in 24 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $427.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was invested across 14 different industries. The largest industries in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 were internet software and services and manufacturing, which represented, as a percentage of our portfolio, 21.5% and 12.2%, respectively, based on fair value.
 As of December 31, 2020, our average investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $17.8 million based on fair value. 
 We conduct private offerings (each, a “Private Offering”) of our common shares to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). At the closing of each Private Offering, each investor makes a capital commitment (a “Capital Commitment”) to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. Until the earlier of a Liquidity Event (as defined below) and the end of the Commitment Period (as defined below), investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. The initial closing of the Private Offering occurred on June 5, 2020 (the “Initial Closing”). As of March 1, 2021, we had $1.4 billion in total Capital Commitments from investors, of which $62.4 million is from entities affiliated with or related to our Adviser. From time to time during the Commitment Period (as defined below), the Adviser may, in its sole discretion, permit one or more additional closings (“Subsequent Closings”) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained (the conclusion of all Subsequent Closings, if any, the “Final Closing”). The “Commitment Period” will continue until the seven year anniversary of the Initial Closing. If we have not consummated a Liquidity Event by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”), the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable

requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner. A Liquidity Event could include: (i) future quotation or listing of the Company’s securities on a national securities exchange (“Exchange Listing)”; (ii) a transaction, including a merger, in which shareholders receive cash or shares of an entity, including an entity that is affiliated with us, and such shares are listed on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.  See “— The Private Offering.”
 If we have not consummated a Liquidity Event by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.
 We are an externally managed, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As a BDC, at least 70% of our assets must be assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, as described herein. See “— Regulation as a Business Development Company” and “— Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”
 We generally intend to distribute, out of assets legally available for distribution, substantially all of our available earnings, on a quarterly basis, as determined by our Board in its sole discretion.
 We may borrow money from time to time if immediately after such borrowing, the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, is at least 150%. This means that generally, we can borrow up to $2 for every $1 of investor equity. We have entered into a subscription line revolving credit facility (the “Subscription Credit Facility”). We expect to use our credit facility and other borrowings, along with proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio and proceeds from the Private Offerings, to finance our investment objectives. See “— Regulation as a Business Development Company” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. See “ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationS — Debt.”
 
The Adviser and Administrator — Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC
  Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC serves as our investment adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) between us and the Adviser. See “—Investment Advisory Agreement.”  The Adviser serves as our Administrator pursuant to an Administration Agreement between us and the Adviser which was entered into on June 4, 2020 (the "Administration Agreement").  See "Administration Agreement" below. The Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”).  The Adviser is an indirect subsidiary of Owl Rock Capital Partners. Owl Rock Capital Partners is led by its three co-founders, Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer. The Adviser’s investment team (the “Investment Team”) is also led by Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer and is supported by certain members of the Adviser’s senior executive team and Investment Committee.  The investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) is comprised of Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer, and Alexis Maged. The Investment Team, under the Investment Committee’s supervision, sources investment opportunities, conducts research, performs due diligence on potential investments, structures the Company’s investments and monitors the Company’s portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has limited operating history. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us.
 On December 23, 2020, Owl Rock Capital Group, the parent of the Adviser (and a subsidiary of Owl Rock Capital Partners), and Dyal Capital Partners (“Dyal”) announced they are merging to form Blue Owl Capital (“Blue Owl”).  Blue Owl will enter the public market via its acquisition by Altimar Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:ATAC) (“Altimar”), a special purpose acquisition company (the “Transaction”). If the Transaction is consummated, there will be no changes to the Company’s investment strategy or the Adviser’s investment team or investment process with respect to the Company; however, the Transaction with result in a change in control of the Adviser, which will be deemed an assignment of the Investment Advisory Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act. As a result, the Board, after considering the Transaction and subsequent change in control, has determined that upon consummation of the Transaction and subject to the approval of the Company’s shareholders at a special meeting expected to be held on March 17, 2021, the Company should enter into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Board also determined that upon consummation of the Transaction, the Company should enter into an amended and restated administration agreement with the Adviser on terms that are identical to the Administration Agreement.
 The Adviser is affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC (“ORCA”), Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC (“ORTA”) and Owl Rock Private Fund Advisors LLC (“ORPFA” and together with the Adviser, ORCA and ORTA, the “Owl Rock Advise

We refer to the Owl Rock BDCs and the Owl Rock Private Funds, as the “Owl Rock Clients.”
The Owl Rock Advisers may provide management or investment advisory services to entities that have overlapping objectives with us. The Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and others. In order to address these conflicts, the Owl Rock Advisers have put in place an investment allocation policy that addresses the allocation of investment opportunities as well as co-investment restrictions under the 1940 Act.
 In addition, we intend to rely on exemptive relief that has been granted by the SEC to ORCA and certain of its affiliates to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. 
 In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs, through December 31, 2020, we were permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain other private funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and covered by our exemptive relief, even if such private funds had not previously invested in such existing portfolio company. Without this order, the private funds would generally not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with us unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with us. Although the conditional exemptive order has expired, the SEC’s Division of Investment Management has indicated that until March 31, 2021, it will not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing coinvestment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the conditional exemptive order, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. 
 The Owl Rock Advisers’ allocation policy incorporates the conditions of the exemptive relief. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of the Owl Rock Clients and/or other funds established by the Owl Rock Advisers that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief.
