ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
EP Energy Corporation (“EP Energy”), a Delaware corporation formed in 2013, is an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition and development of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Our strategy is to invest in opportunities that provide the highest return across our asset base, continually seek out operating and capital efficiencies, effectively manage costs, and identify accretive acquisition opportunities and divestitures, all with the objective of enhancing our portfolio, growing asset value, improving cash flow and increasing financial flexibility. 
We operate through a diverse base of producing assets and are focused on the development of our drilling inventory located in three areas: the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, Northeastern Utah (“NEU”) in the Uinta basin, and the Permian basin in West Texas. As of December 31, 2019, we had proved reserves of 189.7 MMBoe (49% oil and 70% liquids) and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we had average net daily production of 70,898 Boe/d (54% oil and 73% liquids).
Each of our areas is characterized by a long-lived reserve base and high drilling success rates. We have established significant contiguous leasehold positions in each area, representing approximately 465,000 net (609,000 gross) acres in total. 
In addition to opportunities in our current portfolio, strategic acquisitions of leasehold acreage or acquisitions of producing assets can allow us to leverage existing expertise in our operating areas, balance our exposure to regions, basins and commodities, help us achieve or enhance risk-adjusted returns competitive with those available in our existing programs and increase our reserves. We also continuously evaluate our asset portfolio and will sell oil and natural gas properties if they no longer meet our long-term objectives.
Reorganization and Chapter 11 Cases
Formation of Special Committee. In the second quarter 2019, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed a special committee (the “Special Committee”) of three independent directors that are not affiliated with the Sponsors (affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (“Apollo”), Riverstone Holdings LLC, Access Industries, Inc. (“Access”) and Korea National Oil Corporation, collectively, the “Sponsors”), and we engaged financial and legal advisors to consider a number of potential actions and evaluate certain strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and balance sheet issues.
Covenant Violations, Forbearance, and Chapter 11 Cases.  On August 15, 2019, we did not make the approximately $40 million cash interest payment due and payable with respect to the 8.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “2025 1.5 Lien Notes”). On September 3, 2019, we did not make the approximately $7 million cash interest payment due and payable with respect to the 7.750% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Unsecured Notes”). Our failure to make these interest payments within thirty days after they were due and payable resulted in an event of default under the respective indentures governing the 2025 1.5 Lien Notes and 2022 Unsecured Notes. Each event of default under the indentures noted above also resulted in a cross-default under the Prepetition Reserve-Based Facility (“RBL Facility”).
On September 14, 2019, we entered into forbearance agreements, extending through October 3, 2019, with (i) certain beneficial owners and/or investment advisors or managers of discretionary accounts for the beneficial owners of greater than 70% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2025 1.5 Lien Notes (collectively, the “Noteholders”) and (ii) certain lenders holding greater than a majority of the revolving commitments under our RBL Facility and the administrative agent and collateral agent under the RBL Facility (collectively, the “RBL Forbearing Parties”) pursuant to which each Noteholder and RBL Forbearing Party temporarily agreed to forbear from exercising any rights or remedies they may have occurred in respect of the failure to make the $40 million cash interest payment.
On October 3, 2019, we and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively with the Company, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) seeking relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). To ensure ordinary course operations, the Debtors obtained approval from the Bankruptcy Court for a variety of “first day” motions, including motions to obtain customary relief intended to assure our ability to continue our ordinary course operations after the filing date. In addition, the Debtors received authority to use cash collateral of the lenders under the RBL Facility.
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an immediate event of default, and caused the automatic and immediate acceleration of all debt outstanding under or in respect of a number of our instruments and agreements relating to our direct financial obligations, including our RBL Facility and indentures governing the 2025 1.5 Lien Notes, 7.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, 8.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 1.25 Lien Notes”), 9.375% Senior Secured Notes 
1

due 2024 (the “2024 1.5 Lien Notes”), 9.375% Senior Notes due 2020, 2022 Unsecured Notes and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2023 (collectively, the “Senior Notes”). Any efforts to enforce such payment obligations were automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the creditors’ rights of enforcement in respect of the Senior Notes and the RBL Facility are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.
Plan Support Agreement and Backstop Commitment Agreement. On October 18, 2019, the Debtors entered into a plan support agreement (the “PSA”) to support a restructuring on the terms of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization (as defined below, the “Plan”) with holders of approximately 52.0% of the 2024 1.25 Lien Notes and approximately 79.3% of the 2024 1.5 Lien Notes and the 2025 1.5 Lien Notes issued, in each case, by EP Energy LLC and Everest Acquisition Finance Inc. The holders of these notes include affiliates of, or funds managed by, Elliott Management Corporation (“Elliott”), Apollo (together with Elliott, the “Initial Supporting Noteholders”), Access, and Avenue Capital Group (collectively, with the Initial Supporting Noteholders and Access, the “Supporting Noteholders”), to support a restructuring on the terms of a chapter 11 plan described therein. On October 18, 2019, the Debtors also entered into a backstop commitment agreement (the “BCA”) with the Supporting Noteholders, pursuant to which the Supporting Noteholders agreed to backstop $463 million (to consist of $325 million in cash and $138 million in exchanged reinstated 1.25L Notes) of the Rights Offering. For additional information, see Termination of Plan Support Agreement and Backstop Commitment Agreement below. 
Plan of Reorganization. On November 18, 2019, the Debtors filed a proposed Joint Chapter 11 Plan and a proposed Disclosure Statement for Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization describing the Plan and the solicitation of votes to approve the same from certain of the Debtors’ creditors with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors subsequently filed various amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement and on January 13, 2020, filed an updated Fourth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of EP Energy Corporation and its Affiliated Debtors (as amended from time to time, the “Plan”) and an updated Disclosure Statement (as amended from time to time, the “Disclosure Statement”). On March 6, 2020, after a hearing to confirm the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court stated that it would confirm the Plan. On March 12, 2020, pursuant to its ruling on March 6, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan (ECF No. 1049).
Termination of Plan Support Agreement and Backstop Commitment Agreement. Commodity prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current global geopolitical and economic conditions. As a result of a decrease in global demand for oil and natural gas due to the recent coronavirus outbreaks, in March 2020, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia considered extending their agreed oil production cuts and making additional oil production cuts. However, negotiations to date have been unsuccessful. Saudi Arabia announced a significant increase in its maximum crude oil production capacity, targeting to supply 12.3 million barrels per day, an increase of 2.5 million barrels per day, effective immediately, and Russia announced that all agreed oil production cuts between members of OPEC and Russia will expire on April 1, 2020. Following these announcements, within one day, global oil prices declined to their lowest levels since 2016 and partially recovered, but may continue to decline. In addition, coronavirus outbreaks have resulted in delays, supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions that have impacted the oil and gas industry. 
Subsequent to these events, on March 18, 2020, the Debtors and the Supporting Noteholders under the PSA and in their capacities as the Commitment Parties under the BCA, mutually agreed to amend and terminate the PSA and the BCA pursuant to the terms of a Stipulation of Settlement Regarding Backstop Agreement and Plan Support Agreement (as may be amended or modified from time to time, the “Stipulation”). Among other things, the Stipulation provides that (i) the PSA and BCA are terminated consensually by the parties pursuant to Section 9.1 of the BCA and Section 7(f) of the PSA, (ii) the Termination Fee (as defined in the BCA) shall not be payable to the Commitment Parties, (iii) the Debtors will reimburse all fees, costs and expenses of the Supporting Noteholders, and the Commitment Parties through the date on which the Bankruptcy Court approves the Stipulation, and (iv) through November 25, 2020 the Supporting Noteholders and Commitment Parties will not interfere, directly or indirectly, with any further restructuring of the Debtors, that treats their applicable claims no less favorably than other similarly situated claims. The Debtors and the Supporting Noteholders and Commitment Parties also agreed to mutual waivers and releases of certain claims relating to, or arising from, the Chapter 11 Cases, the BCA, the PSA, and the termination of the BCA and the PSA, against the other as described in the Stipulation.
On March 23, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Stipulation. The Debtors are working with their constituents to explore various alternatives.
Debtor-in-Possession Agreement. On November 25, 2019, EPE Acquisition, LLC and EP Energy LLC entered into a Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement (as amended or modified from time to time, the “DIP Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and an issuing bank (the “DIP Agent”) and the RBL Lenders which are party thereto as lenders (in such capacity, the “DIP Lenders”). Under the DIP Credit 
2

Agreement and the order of the Bankruptcy Court entered on November 25, 2019 (the “DIP Order”), a portion of the RBL Facility was converted into revolving commitments under the DIP Credit Agreement which provides for an approximately $315 million debtor-in-possession senior secured superpriority revolving credit facility (the “DIP Facility”, and the loans thereunder, the “DIP Loans”), and which includes a letter of credit sublimit of $50 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $150 million capacity remaining with approximately $17 million of letters of credit issued and $148 million outstanding under the DIP Facility. For a further discussion of the additional terms of the DIP Facility, see Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Note 8.
EP Energy LLC will use the proceeds of the DIP Facility for, among other things, (i) the acquisition, development and exploration of oil and gas properties, for working capital and general corporate purposes, (ii) the payment of professional fees as provided for in the DIP Order, (iii) the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases or as permitted by the certain orders and (iv) payments due thereunder or under the DIP Order. The maturity date of the DIP Facility is the earlier of (a) November 25, 2020, (b) the effective date of an “Acceptable Plan of Reorganization” (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement), (c) the closing of a sale of substantially all of the equity or assets of EP Energy LLC (unless consummated pursuant to an Acceptable Plan of Reorganization), or (d) the termination of the DIP Facility during the continuation of an event of default thereunder. 
On March 12, 2020, EP Energy LLC, EPE Acquisition, LLC, the agent and certain of the lenders under the RBL Facility, the DIP Agent and certain of the DIP Lenders entered into that certain Waiver of Credit Agreements which waived the occurrence of any event of default triggered under the credit agreement governing the RBL Facility (the “RBL Credit Agreement”) and the DIP Credit Agreement as a result of a going concern or like qualification or exception to the audited financials for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Exit Facility. The Debtors have received an underwritten commitment from the DIP Lenders to convert their DIP Loans and their remaining claims under the RBL Facility into an approximately $629 million exit senior secured reserve-based revolving credit facility (the “Exit Facility”) subject to certain conditions set forth therein, which will be evidenced by a senior secured revolving credit agreement, by and among EP Energy LLC, as borrower, EPE Acquisition, LLC, as holdings, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and an issuing bank (the “Exit Credit Agreement”).
For a further discussion of the Chapter 11 Cases and related matters, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, Notes 1A, 8 and 9.
Reserves Summary 
The following table provides a summary of oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as of December 31, 2019 and production data for the year ended December 31, 2019 for each of our areas of operation.

 | Estimated Proved Reserves(1) | 
 | Oil(MMBbls) | NGLs(MMBbls) | | Natural Gas(Bcf) | Total(MMBoe) | Liquids(%) | | Proved Developed (%)(2) | AverageNet DailyProduction(MBoe/d)
Eagle Ford Shale | 53.5 | | 15.5 | | 88.2 | | 83.8 | | 82 | % | 100 | % | 33.7
Northeastern Utah | 24.7 | | — | | 97.3 | | 40.9 | | 60 | % | 100 | % | 15.7
Permian | 14.7 | | 24.0 | | 158.3 | | 65.0 | | 59 | % | 100 | % | 21.5
Total | 92.9 | | 39.5 | | 343.8 | | 189.7 | | 70 | % | 100 | % | 70.9


(1) | Proved reserves were evaluated based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $55.69 per Bbl (WTI), $2.58 per MMBtu (Henry Hub) and $13.37 per Bbl of NGLs.


(2) | As of December 31, 2019, we have no recorded proved undeveloped reserves due to uncertainty regarding the Company's availability of capital prior to emerging from bankruptcy that would be required to develop the PUD reserves (see Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", Note 1A).

Approximately 190 MMBoe, or 100%, of our total proved reserves are proved developed producing assets, which generated average production of 70.9 MBoe/d in 2019 from approximately 1,806 wells. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 93 MMBbls of proved oil reserves, 40 MMBbls of proved NGLs reserves and 344 Bcf of proved natural gas reserves, representing 49%, 21% and 30%, respectively, of our total proved reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 73% of our production was related to oil and NGLs.

As of December 31, 2019, we operated 95% of our producing wells. This control provides us with flexibility around the amount and timing of capital spending and has allowed us to improve our capital and operating efficiencies. We also employ a function-based organizational structure to accelerate knowledge sharing, innovation, evaluation and target efficiencies across our drilling, completion and operating activities across our operating areas. In 2019, we completed 67 wells and as of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 41 wells drilled, but not completed across our programs.
Our Properties
Eagle Ford Shale.  The Eagle Ford Shale, located in South Texas, is one of the premier unconventional oil plays in the United States. We were an early entrant into this play in late 2008, and since that time have acquired a leasehold position in the core of the oil window, primarily in La Salle County. The Eagle Ford formation in La Salle County has up to 125 feet of net thickness (165 feet gross). Due to its high carbonate content, the formation is also very brittle, and exhibits high productivity when fractured.  During 2019, we invested $368 million in capital (excluding approximately $13 million in acquisition capital). As of December 31, 2019, we had 122,276 net (132,952 gross) acres in the Eagle Ford.
 During 2019, we operated an average of two drilling rigs and as of December 31, 2019, we had 852 net producing wells (847 net operated wells) in this program. We are currently not running any rigs in the Eagle Ford. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our average net daily production was 33,700 Boe/d, representing a decrease of 9% over the same period in 2018 due to fewer wells placed on production in the second half of 2018 through 2019. 
Northeastern Utah.  The Northeastern Utah asset is located in Duchesne and Uinta counties in the Uinta basin. The Uinta basin is characterized by naturally fractured, tight-oil sands and carbonates with multiple pay zones. Our operations are primarily focused on developing the NEU Complex, which is comprised of the Altamont, Bluebell and Cedar Rim fields. The NEU Complex has a gross pay interval thickness of over 4,300 feet and we believe the Wasatch and Green River formations are ideal targets for horizontal drilling and modern fracture stimulation techniques. Our commingled production is from over 1,500 feet of net stimulated rock. Historically, our activity has been focused on the development of our vertical inventory on 80-acre and 160-acre spacing; however, we have completed 14 horizontal wells with lateral lengths between 7,900 and 9,800 feet in the Wasatch and Green River formations. Industry activity has focused on horizontal drilling in the Wasatch and Green River formations testing tight carbonate and sand intervals and has also piloted 80-acre vertical downspacing in these formations. Due to the largely held-by-production nature of our acreage position, if horizontal drilling continues to be successful, it will result in additional opportunities that could be added to our inventory of drilling locations.
We are subject to a drilling joint venture to accelerate and fund future oil and natural gas development in
NEU. Under the joint venture, our partner is participating in the development of 53 wells and will provide a capital carry
in exchange for a 50 percent working interest in the joint venture wells. As of December 31, 2019, we have drilled and completed 51 wells under the joint venture agreement.
During 2019, we invested $144 million in capital in NEU (excluding approximately $6 million in acquisition capital). As of December 31, 2019, we had 160,891 net (292,641 gross) acres in NEU. 
During 2019, we operated an average of two drilling rigs in NEU. As of December 31, 2019, we had 350 net producing wells (345 net operated wells) and are currently running two rigs in this program.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, our average net daily production was 15,687 Boe/d, representing a decrease of 8% over 2018 due to reduced drilling activity in 2019.
Permian.  The Permian basin is characterized by numerous stacked oil reservoirs (including the Wolfcamp A, B and C zones) that provide multiple targets for horizontal drilling. In 2009 and 2010, we leased 138,130 net (138,469 gross) acres on the University of Texas Land System in the Permian basin, located primarily in Reagan, Crockett, Upton and Irion counties. In 2014, we acquired approximately 37,000 net acres in the Southern Midland basin. As of December 31, 2019, we had 182,113 net (183,029 gross) acres in the Permian.
We are party to a Consolidated Drilling and Development Unit Agreement with the University of Texas Land System in the Permian basin to provide flexibility to extend the time frame to hold our acreage through 2021, with an annual well completion requirement of 55 wells per year through 2020. For the years ended 2016 and 2017, we met our annual well completion requirement; however, we failed to meet this requirement in 2018 and 2019. To the extent that we meet our annual well completion requirement, the wells completed during that year qualify for a variable royalty, which is determined using a rolling average six month price with royalty rates of 12.5% at an average price of $50 per Bbl (WTI) and below; 18.75% at an average price of $50.01 to $60 per Bbl (WTI); 25% at an average price of $60.01 to $80 per Bbl (WTI); and 28% above $80 per Bbl (WTI). Should we not meet our annual well completion requirement in a given year, the wells completed during that given year will not qualify for the variable royalty and instead be subject to a 25.00% royalty rate.
4

During 2019, we invested $5 million in capital in the Permian and we did not operate any drilling rigs. As of December 31, 2019, we had 356 net producing wells (353 net operated wells). We are currently not running any rigs in this program.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, our average net daily production was 21,464 Boe/d, representing a decrease of 19% over 2018, reflecting the slower pace of development from reduced capital spending in 2019. In Permian, our 2019 production volumes were also negatively impacted by downstream third-party operational issues and constraints and more reinjected gas as compared to the same period in 2018.
The following table provides a summary of acreage and gross operated wells completed in each of the following areas as of December 31, 2019:

 | Acres | Gross Operated Wells Completed(#)
 | Gross | Net | 
Eagle Ford Shale | 132,952 | | 122,276 | 54
Northeastern Utah | 292,641 | | 160,891 | 13

Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Reserves and Production
Proved Reserves
The proved oil and gas reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019 presented in the table below have been prepared by Ryder Scott Company L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent third party reserve engineers. The reserve data represents only estimates, which are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, and is consistent with estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies except for differences of less than 5% resulting from actual production, acquisitions, property sales, necessary reserve revisions and additions to reflect actual experience. The risks and uncertainties associated with estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves are discussed further in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at December 31, 2019.

(1) | Proved reserves were evaluated based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $55.69 per Bbl (WTI), $2.58 per MMBtu (Henry Hub) and $13.37 per Bbl of NGLs. For a further discussion of our proved reserves and changes therein, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations.


(2) | As of December 31, 2019, we have no recorded proved undeveloped (“PUD”) reserves due to uncertainty regarding the Company's availability of capital prior to emerging from bankruptcy that would be required to develop the PUD reserves (see Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", Note 1A).

The table below presents net proved reserves as reported and sensitivities related to our estimated proved reserves based on differing price scenarios as of December 31, 2019.

 | Net Proved Reserves(MMBoe)
As Reported | 189.7 
10 percent increase in commodity prices | 198.5 
10 percent decrease in commodity prices | 178.0 

The sensitivities in the table above were based on the average first day of the month spot price for the preceding 12-month period of $55.69 per barrel of oil (WTI), $2.58 per MMBtu of natural gas (Henry Hub) and $13.37 per Bbl of NGLs used to determine net proved reserves at December 31, 2019.
Ryder Scott prepared 100% (by volume) of our total net proved developed reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. The overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Ryder Scott in evaluating and preparing estimates of our net proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 complied with current SEC regulations. Ryder Scott’s report is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The technical person at Ryder Scott primarily responsible for overseeing the reserves evaluation and preparation has a B.S. degree in petroleum engineering. She is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and has more than 15 years of experience in petroleum reserves evaluation.

The significant assumptions used in the proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by Ryder Scott were also assessed by our internal reserve team. Our internal reserve team is comprised of a technical staff of engineers and geoscientists that perform technical analysis of each undeveloped location. The staff uses industry accepted practices to estimate, with reasonable certainty, the economically producible oil and natural gas. The practices for estimating hydrocarbons in place include, but are not limited to, mapping, seismic interpretation of two-dimensional and/or three-dimensional data, core analysis, mechanical properties of formations, thermal maturity, well logs of existing penetrations, correlation of known penetrations, decline curve analysis of producing locations with significant production history, well testing, static bottom hole testing, flowing bottom hole pressure analysis and pressure and rate transient analysis.
Our primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing our reserves estimates has a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Finance. He leads the strategic planning and reservoir engineering evaluation groups of the company.  In this capacity, he oversees the reserve reporting and engagement with the company's independent third party engineering firm. He has 15 years of industry experience in various modeling, technical support and management roles. For a discussion of the internal controls over our proved reserves estimation process, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates”.
In general, the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire additional properties with proved reserves, or both, our proved reserves will decline as they are produced. Recovery of PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but future events, including commodity price changes, may cause these assumptions to change. In addition, estimates of PUD reserves and proved non-producing reserves are inherently subject to greater uncertainties than estimates of proved producing reserves. For further discussion of our reserves, see Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (“PUDs”)
Estimated capital expenditures to develop our PUD reserves (convert PUD reserves to proved developed reserves) are based upon a long-range plan approved by our management team and reviewed with the Board of Directors. All PUD locations are surrounded by producing properties, and a majority of our PUDs directly offset a producing property. When we record PUDs beyond one location away from a producing property, reasonable certainty of economic producibility has been established by reliable technology in our areas, including field tests that demonstrate consistent and repeatable results within the formation being evaluated.
As of December 31, 2019, we have no recorded PUD reserves due to uncertainty regarding the Company's availability of capital prior to emerging from bankruptcy that would be required to develop the PUD reserves (see Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", Note 1A).

As of December 31, 2018, our PUD reserves reflected PUD bookings methodology utilizing a three-year timeframe as a result of our available liquidity at that time and access to the capital markets due to the economic price environment. The 2018 information in the table includes 64 MMBoe (29 MMBoe to extensions and discoveries, 4 MMBoe to acquisitions, and 31 MMBoe to revisions other than price) of negative adjustments in 2018 when calculating each respective category as a result of determining our PUDs using a three-year timeframe instead of a five-year timeframe.
The following table summarizes our changes in PUDs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively (in MMBoe): 

Balance, December 31, 2017 | 173.8 | 
Acquisitions | 12.5 | 
Revisions due to prices | 0.1 | 
Revisions other than prices | (65.6 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (22.6 | )
Divestitures | (7.3 | )
Balance, December 31, 2018 | 90.9 | 
Acquisitions | — | 
Revisions due to prices | — | 
Revisions other than prices | (3.2 | )
Transfers to proved developed | (14.8 | )
Divestitures | — | 
Revisions due to going concern uncertainties/Chapter 11 cases | (72.9 | )
Balance, December 31, 2019 | — | 

Revisions due to prices represent PUD revisions due to increases or decreases in commodity prices (using SEC 12-month average pricing). Revisions to PUDs other than prices for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily include negative revisions of 37 MMBoe in NEU and 36 MMBoe in the Eagle Ford due to uncertainty regarding the Company's availability of capital prior to emerging from bankruptcy and 3 MMBoe of negative revisions due to asset performance. Revisions to PUDs other than prices for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily include negative revisions of 74 MMBoe due to a reallocation of capital from the Permian to other development areas and positive revisions of 12 MMBoe associated with increased drilling activity in the Eagle Ford and NEU.
During 2019, 2018 and 2017 we spent approximately $339 million, $444 million and $377 million, respectively, to convert approximately 16% or 15 MMBoe, 13% or 23 MMBoe and 13% or 31 MMBoe, respectively, of our prior year-end PUD reserves to proved developed reserves.  As of December 31, 2019, due to uncertainty regarding the Company's availability of capital prior to emerging from bankruptcy that would be required to develop the PUD reserves, we have no recorded PUD reserves at December 31, 2019. Accordingly. we have not included forecasted capital spending to develop any PUD reserves. 
On March 12, 2020, pursuant to its ruling on March 6, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan (ECF No. 1049). On March 18, 2020, the Debtors and the Supporting Noteholders under the PSA and in their capacities as the Commitment Parties under the BCA mutually agreed to amend and terminate the PSA and the BCA pursuant the terms of the Stipulation. On March 23, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Stipulation. The Debtors are working with their constituents to explore various alternatives. We expect to report PUD reserves in the future to the extent we determine that we have the financial capability to execute a development plan to develop our PUD reserves. The actual amount and timing of our forecasted expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, oilfield service costs, technology, acreage position, availability of capital and future commodity prices, which in the future could be lower than those in our projected long-range plan.

Acquisition, Development and Exploration Expenditures
See Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” under the heading Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Operations in the Total Costs Incurred table for details on our acquisition, development and exploration expenditures.
Transportation, Markets and Customers
Our marketing strategy seeks to ensure maximum deliverability of our physical production at the maximum realized prices. We leverage knowledge of markets and transportation infrastructure to enter into beneficial downstream processing, treating and marketing contracts. We primarily sell our domestic oil and natural gas production to third parties at spot market prices, while we sell our NGLs at market prices under monthly or long-term contracts. We typically sell our oil production to a relatively small number of creditworthy counterparties, as is customary in the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2019, nine purchasers accounted for approximately 89% of our oil revenues. The top two purchasers are: Shell Trading U.S. Co. (an affiliate of Shell Oil Company) and Flint Hills Resources, LP (an affiliate of Koch Industries), which together accounted for approximately 47% of our oil revenues. Across all of our areas, we maintain adequate gathering, treating, processing and transportation capacity, as well as downstream sales arrangements, to accommodate our production volumes.
In our Eagle Ford Shale area, we are connected to the Camino Real oil gathering system and to the NuStar Energy system.  The majority of our oil production flows on Camino Real, a 68-mile long pipeline with over 110,000 Bbls/d of capacity and a gravity bank that allows for oil blending to maintain attractive API levels. We have 80,000 Bbls/d of firm capacity on this oil system, of which we utilized an average of 24% during December 2019 and 29% on average for the year.  The system delivers oil to the Storey Oil Terminal east of Cotulla, Texas, southeast of Gardendale, Texas.  From the Storey Oil Terminal, oil can be pumped into Harvest’s Arrowhead #1 and/or #2 pipelines, as well as the Plains All American Pipeline connection to the Gardendale Hub.  Oil can also be loaded into trucks out of the Storey Oil Terminal or out of the numerous central tank batteries throughout our field, providing additional deliverability, reliability and flexibility.  We currently market our oil either at the Storey Oil Terminal, Gardendale or at our central tank batteries under a combination of short and long-term contracts, ranging from monthly deals to multi-year term sales. With adequate takeaway capacity in the region and close proximity to the Gulf Coast refining complex, we believe we have sufficient capacity on our contracts and do not anticipate any issues with marketing and delivering volumes from the Eagle Ford Shale. 
Our Eagle Ford natural gas production flows on either the Camino Real gas gathering system or the Frio LaSalle Pipeline system with the majority flowing on the Camino Real gas gathering system. The Camino Real gas gathering system receives high-pressure, unprocessed wellhead gas into an 83-mile pipeline with capacity up to 150 MMcf/d.  The gas is then redelivered into interconnects with ETC Texas Pipeline LTD, Enterprise Hydrocarbons LP, Regency Energy Partners LP and Eagle Ford Gathering LLC.  We currently have 125 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity on Camino Real, of which we used an average of 35% during December 2019 and 33% on average for the year, and we have additional capacity available as needed.  We have firm gas gathering, processing and transportation agreements on three of the interconnected gas pipelines downstream of the Camino Real system, with a minimum capacity of approximately 100 MMBtu/d and rights to increase firm capacity as necessary.  In addition, gas produced from our northwest acreage position within the Eagle Ford area is connected to the Frio LaSalle Pipeline system, which provides access to firm H2S treating and processing.  Frio LaSalle can either return gas to the Camino Real system or, after processing, deliver to various Texas intrastate pipelines and a mix of interstates, such as Texas Eastern Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and Transco. We market our physical gas to various purchasers at spot market prices. 
In NEU, the wax crude we produce is sold at the wellhead to multiple purchasers who transport the oil via truck to downstream refineries. We sell most of the oil we produce in the basin to Salt Lake City refineries under long-term sales agreements that accommodate our production forecasts. Our produced natural gas is gathered and processed at the Altamont plant, a third-party-owned processing facility, under a long-term sales agreement that provides for residue gas return for operational use. 
In the Permian basin, we continue to leverage significant legacy gathering, processing and transportation infrastructure. For natural gas, we are connected to the West Texas Gas (WTG), DCP Midstream LP, Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent WestTex LLC and Cogent Midstream, LLC gathering systems, and we process a majority of our gas at the WTG Benedum & Sonora gas plants. We receive Waha pricing for our natural gas and Mt. Belvieu pricing for our NGLs. Our crude oil production facilities are connected to a third party oil gathering system that delivers to a Plains All American Pipeline at Owens Station in Reagan County, Texas, the Centurion Cline Shale Pipeline at Barnhart in Irion County, Texas and to the Magellan Longhorn pipeline in Crockett County, Texas. We sell our pipeline delivered crude to multiple purchasers under both short and long-term contracts at WTI-based pricing. We also maintain the capability to truck crude oil to those same purchasers under similarly-priced contracts to provide additional flow assurance. Given current Permian basin takeaway capacity, we anticipate no limitations moving physical crude oil to market.
10

While most of our physical production is priced off spot market indices, we actively manage the volatility of spot market pricing through our risk management program. We enter into financial derivatives contracts on our oil, natural gas and a portion of our NGLs production to stabilize our cash flows, reduce the risk of downward commodity price movements and protect the economic assumptions associated with our capital investment program. We employ a disciplined risk management program that utilizes risk control processes. For a further discussion of these risk management activities and derivative contracts, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
Competitors
The exploration and production business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of additional oil and natural gas reserves and in the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Our competitors include major and intermediate sized oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas operators and individual producers or operators with varying scopes of operations and financial resources. Competitive factors include financial resources, price and contract terms, our ability to access drilling, completion and other equipment and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel on a timely and cost effective basis. Ultimately, our future success in this business will be dependent on our ability to find and/or fund the acquisition and development of additional reserves at costs that yield acceptable returns on the capital invested.
Use of 3-D Seismic Data
Within our areas we have an inventory of approximately 1,473 square miles of 3-D seismic data providing approximately 48% coverage of our leased acreage in those areas. We use our 3-D seismic data to improve our geologic models for each area. In the Eagle Ford and the Permian, detailed maps of structural features (e.g., natural fractures, faulting and stratigraphic discontinuities) are used to position well bore laterals to optimally exploit oil bearing zones and navigate drilling hazards. In NEU, data analytics are run using 3-D seismic attributes to identify ideal locations in the reservoir and estimate resource distribution. Seismic data sets are continually updated to keep pace with technological advancements in seismic processing. 
Regulatory Environment
Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are regulated at the federal, state and local levels in the United States. These regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the drilling and spacing of wells, conservation, forced pooling and protection of correlative rights among interest owners.  We are also subject to various governmental safety and environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our operations under federal oil and natural gas leases are regulated by the statutes and regulations of the Department of the Interior (“DOI”) that currently impose liability upon lessees for the cost of environmental impacts resulting from their operations. Royalty obligations on all federal leases are regulated by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue within the DOI, which has promulgated valuation guidelines for the payment of royalties by producers. These laws and regulations affect the construction and operation of facilities, water disposal rights and drilling operations, among other items.  In addition, we maintain insurance to limit exposure to sudden and accidental pollution liability exposures.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a process of pumping fluid and proppant (usually sand) under high pressure into deep underground geologic formations that contain recoverable hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbon formations are typically thousands of feet below the surface. The hydraulic fracturing process creates small fractures in the hydrocarbon formation. These fractures allow natural gas and oil to move more freely through the formation to the well and finally to the surface production facilities. We use hydraulic fracturing to maximize productivity of our oil and natural gas wells in our areas, and our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves will be developed using hydraulic fracturing. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred costs of approximately $95 million associated with hydraulic fracturing.
Hydraulic fracturing fluid is typically composed of over 99% water and proppant. The other 1% or less of the fluid is composed of additives that may contain acid, friction reducer, surfactant, gelling agent and scale inhibitor. We retain service companies to conduct such operations and we have worked with several service companies to evaluate, test and, where appropriate, modify our fluid design to reduce the use of chemicals in our fracturing fluid. We have worked closely with our service companies to provide voluntary and regulatory disclosure of our hydraulic fracturing fluids.
In order to protect surface and groundwater quality during the drilling and completion phases of our operations, we follow applicable industry practices and legal requirements of the applicable state oil and natural gas commissions with regard to well design, including requirements associated with casing steel strength, cement strength and slurry design. Our activities in the field are monitored by state and federal regulators. Key aspects of our field protection measures include: (i) pressure testing well construction and integrity, (ii) casing and cementing practices to ensure pressure management and separation of hydrocarbons from groundwater, and (iii) public disclosure of the contents of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
11

In addition to these measures, our drilling, casing and cementing procedures are designed to prevent fluid migration and typically include some or all of the following:

• | Our drilling process executes several repeated cycles conducted in sequence—drill, set casing, cement casing and then test casing and cement for integrity before proceeding to the next drilling interval.


• | Conductor casing is drilled and cemented or driven in place. This string serves as the structural foundation for the well. Conductor casing is not necessary or required for all wells.


• | Surface casing is set and is cemented in place. Surface casing is set on all wells. The purpose of the surface casing is to isolate and protect Underground Sources of Drinking Water (“USDW”) as identified by federal and state regulatory bodies. The surface casing and cement isolates wellbore materials from any potential contact with USDWs.


• | Intermediate casing is set through the surface casing to a depth necessary to isolate abnormally pressured subsurface formations from normally pressured formations. Intermediate casing is not necessary or required for all wells. Our standard practices include cementing above any hydrocarbon bearing zone and performing casing pressure tests to verify the integrity of the casing and cement.


• | Production casing is set through the surface and intermediate casing through the depth of the targeted producing formation. Our standard practices include pumping cement above the confining structure of the target zone and performing casing pressure tests and other tests to verify the integrity of the casing and cement. If any problems are detected, then appropriate remedial action is taken.


• | With the casing set and cemented, a barrier of steel and cement is in place that is designed to isolate the wellbore from surrounding geologic formations. This barrier as designed mitigates against the risk of drilling or fracturing fluids entering potential sources of drinking water.

In addition to the required use of casing and cement in the well construction, we follow additional regulatory requirements and industry operating practices. These typically include pressure testing of casing and surface equipment and continuous monitoring of surface pressure, pumping rates, volumes of fluids and chemical concentrations during hydraulic fracturing operations. When any pressure differential outside the normal range of operations occurs, pumping is shut down until the cause of the pressure differential is identified and any required remedial measures are completed. Hydraulic fracturing fluid is delivered to our sites in accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations in DOT approved shipping containers using DOT transporters.
We also have procedures to address water use and disposal. This includes evaluating surface and groundwater sources, commercial sources, and potential recycling and reuse of treated water sources. When commercially and technically feasible, we use recycled or treated water. This practice helps mitigate against potential adverse impacts to other water supply sources. When using raw surface or groundwater, we obtain all required water rights or compensate owners for water consumption. We are evaluating additional treatment capability to augment future water supplies at several of our sites. During our drilling and completions operations, we manage waste water to minimize environmental risks and costs. Flowback water returned to the surface is typically contained in steel tanks or pits. Water that is not treated for reuse is typically piped or trucked to waste disposal injection wells, a number of which we operate. These wells are permitted through the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program of the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”). We also use commercial UIC permitted water injection facilities for flowback and produced water disposal.
We have not received regulatory citations or notice of suits related to our hydraulic fracturing operations for environmental concerns. We have not experienced a surface release of fluids associated with hydraulic fracturing that resulted in material financial exposure or significant environmental impact. Consistent with local, state and federal requirements, releases are reported to appropriate regulatory agencies and site restoration completed. No remediation reserve has been identified or anticipated as a result of hydraulic fracturing releases experienced to date.
Spill Prevention/Response Procedures. There are various state and federal regulations that are designed to prevent and respond to any spills or leaks resulting from exploration and production activities. In this regard, we maintain spill prevention control and countermeasures programs, which frequently include the installation and maintenance of spill containment devices designed to contain spill materials on location. In addition, we maintain emergency response plans to minimize potential environmental impacts in the event of a spill or leak or any significant hydraulic fracturing well control issue.
