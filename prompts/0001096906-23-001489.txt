Mr. Cox brings over 25 years of experience in the oil gas industry changed the Company’s business strategy to oil and gas exploration and investment.
 
Nature of Business
 
The Company is a growing U.S. energy company based in Frisco, Texas, engaged in the acquisition and development of high-probability, lower risk onshore oil and gas properties within the major oil and gas plays in the U.S. The Company’s dual-focused growth strategy relies primarily on leveraging management’s expertise to grow through the strategic acquisition of non-operating, working interests and royalty interests with the goal of developing into a major company in the industry. Through this strategy of acquisition of royalty and non-operating properties, the Company has the unique ability to rely on the technical and scientific expertise of the world-class E&P companies operating in the area.
 
The Company focuses on the acquisition of and exploitation of upstream energy assets, specifically targeting oil and gas mineral interests, oil and gas royalty interests and select non-operated working interests. We do not drill wells and we do not operate wells. These acquisitions are structured primarily as acquisitions of leases, real property interests and mineral rights and royalties and are generally not regarded as the acquisition of securities, but rather real property interests. As a royalty owner, the Company has the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally is not required to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage.
 
The Company began purchasing mineral and oil and gas royalty interests and surface properties in September 2020 and since such time has completed a total of 18 purchases.
 
Plan of Operations
 
The Company has implemented its business plan and continues to expand its services and products.  The Company has generated royalty revenues from its oil and gas assets: however, the Company requires a higher volume of royalty revenues in order to raise sufficient operating cash flows to operate its business without the reliance upon equity or debt financing. The Company may be required to raise additional funds by way of equity or debt financing to fund expansion of its operations.
Government Regulation
 
The oil and gas business is subject to extensive governmental regulation under which, among other things, rates of production from our wells may be fixed. Governmental regulation also may limit or otherwise affect the market for wells’ production and the price which may be paid for that production. Governmental regulations relating to environmental matters could also affect our operations. The nature and extent of various regulations, the nature of other political developments and their overall effect upon us are not predictable.
