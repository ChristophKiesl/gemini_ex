These new product verticals are addressed through our proprietary standardization, enrichment and visualization of connected vehicle data enabling us to uncover an immense wealth of information about mobility and enable solutions that serve both distinct markets. 
Connected vehicle data is generated by a range of sensors that transmit information from connected vehicles, totaling billions of data points every day. This data can be temporal and geospatial, indicating when and where the information is generated. We ingest, standardize, store, and process this data, supporting our efforts to design and manage public, commercial, and personal solutions from traffic management and road intelligence to 3D parking and remote vehicle diagnostics, to name a few. 
Our products, derived insights and software uniquely serve each distinct market. For the automakers and large enterprise customers, we ingest raw data, transform it and create valuable derived insights that these customers can use to manage their businesses. We also leverage insights from their connected vehicle data to fuel our data and analytics products. We also offer our tools to help automakers process their own data to create value from their internal use cases. For our new markets, we provide transportation information, analytics and services using connected vehicle data to support our product lines. 
Our products leverage connected vehicle data to allow road transportation users and operators benefit from safer and better travel experiences. We create strategies, along with the right products and services, that generate substantial value from this data.

Competitive Strengths
Our leadership in the connected vehicle data market and the billions of data points that we ingest and standardize every day, live from vehicles in near real-time, enables us to provide products and services that make our roads safer, smarter, and more sustainable. While we are still early in the launch of many of our Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions products, our company already has a proven track record of contributing to traffic management solutions, through the first product we have launched, Traffic Management. We have launched our visualization tools platform Wejo Studio and have gained our first major OEM customer for data management services. We expect to expand our capabilities to six of the eight product lines of Wejo Marketplace Data Solutions in 2022, and we will be expanding to numerous customers in Wejo Software & Cloud Solutions, both with expanded software and visualization tools, solutions and services.
One of Wejo’s fundamental competitive advantages for Smart Mobility is in its proprietary data sets sourced directly from vehicle-integrated sensors. This data, combined with insights that Wejo creates from numerous data sets, machine learning and artificial intelligence, provides more accurate near real-time and in-journey data as compared to current market technology that relies on inferred mobile data and after-market devices. For example, additional sensor data, from even a small subset of vehicles, allows our uniquely differentiated technology to provide near real-time insights into road and environmental conditions. As of December 31, 2021, Wejo had 16.1 million monetizable vehicles on the Neural Edge platform from currently onboarded OEMs, a 29% increase over the prior year-end. Of these monetizable vehicles, 11.8 million were active on our Neural Edge platform within the last six months of which we ingested and standardized their related data, tracking over 71.6 million journeys and 16.0 billion data points a day, primarily in the United States. In total, we have ingested more than 7.7 petabytes of data. Based on existing OEM, automotive suppliers (Tier 1) and distributor (automotive dealer) relationships, we expect that near-real time live streaming vehicles on our platform will increase to 124 million connected vehicles by 2030.
Wejo’s relationships with OEMs have enabled us to develop a deep understanding of different ways connected vehicle data is generated; put simply, no two OEMs have the same way of describing data such as location, speed or braking events. As a result, the Company has developed a proprietary cloud platform, Wejo Neural Edge, which enables data from any OEM to be standardized into a common data model, and a portion of the data is used to develop a rich understanding of the environment around connected vehicles, even in areas where the number of connected vehicles is modest relative to the broader population of vehicles. Through Wejo Neural Edge, our customers may consume the data and data insights without having to deal with the complexities of large data sets and cumbersome data standardization behind the scenes. We expect that as we gain more customers, our common data model will become more widely recognized as the standard that customers expect. We believe that this will open the opportunity for our transformational impact on the future of mobility, autonomous vehicles and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Wejo aims to become the standard for Smart Mobility, as ubiquitous and recognizable as Bluetooth. 
Wejo has fortified its market-leading position by creating Wejo Neural Edge, a technology moat that promotes the sharing, accessing, and use of connected vehicle data, while maintaining vigorous protocols for security and privacy.

Competition
Wejo remains strongly positioned in the competitive landscape in which we operate. Our company was created with specific strategic parameters to govern our operations: to build strong OEM relationships, to advance transportation safety, and to improve the in- and-around the vehicle experience, all while building value. We have strong OEM, Tier 1 and Fleet provider relationships based on our 22 preferred partner relationships, which typically have terms of up to seven years. As of December 31, 2021, we have processed over 16.0 billion data points every day in live near real-time feeds directly from vehicles through our OEM relationships. These OEM data feeds do not come from brokers, the aftermarket, or mobile phone data resellers, which are frequently used as data sources by our competitors. This connected vehicle data comes directly from our OEM relationships and integrations with the connected vehicles. 
Our current and future competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer, and may be larger, have longer operating histories, or have greater available financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as larger installed customer bases. Our current principal competitors can or could include, but are not limited to, technology companies such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and technology provider Ericsson, who offer vehicle connectivity and OEM solutions, whilst there are vertical specific players such as LexisNexis, Verisk and Octo that offer insights for specific product lines. In addition, data and technology conglomerates, such as Google, Apple, and Amazon, could provide intense competition given their data and technological capabilities and resources to fund rapid development.
The convergence of our vision, our technology, and our OEM relationships allows us to process and standardize unparalleled amounts of data to create our proprietary data set. We have relationships with OEMs in Asia, Europe and in the United States with multiple different data standards that, as we onboard to our platform, will converge to one standard. We standardize up to 486,000 data points a second. 
In addition to our technology and broad suite of planned products, OEMs are willing to evaluate many more incremental services that we offer. We see opportunities to use our platform to redistribute data internally to their businesses, to visualize their data for them, and to provide services that help them comply with legal and regulatory requirements. With these new experiences, we gain more insight into the data, and OEMs gain more insight into our capabilities. As the richness of our data analytics grows, so does the opportunity for us to develop and offer SaaS Solutions to the automotive industry. 
While others may talk about privacy, we build privacy by design. Our global security certifications and process controls comply with GDPR. This privacy backbone gives OEMs confidence in the security of their data.

Similarly, any country that Wejo may enter into for business may have related or more stringent personal data, consumer protection and cybersecurity requirements. The obligations that these laws and regulations impose can be extensive, including but not limited to restrictions on when data can be collected from a person, requirements to obtain consent to collect data from a person, requirements to disclose how data is collected, used and stored, requirements for extensive record keeping on systems processing personal data, geographic limitations on where the data can be stored and processed, contractual obligations that must be maintained with data providers and data recipients, standard contract clauses approved by the European Union (“EU”) when transferring data outside of the European Economic Area, responding to consumer inquiries, notifying regulatory authorities about data breaches, and designating data protection officers. Wejo has incorporated into the platform and the operations features and processes that the Company believes allow us to comply with these types of laws and regulations in the locations where we currently collect data. In fact, the Company has maintained over the past 5 years, and will continue to strive to uphold security and privacy governance certifications, including Cyber Essentials Plus, IASME Gold and ISO27001 (since 2020) certifications, the combination of which indicates our approach to using that best practice and support our commitment to serving our data subjects and customers by protecting all data in keeping with legislative and regulatory requirements. 
Before we begin services into a new country, we review applicable laws and regulations and create a plan to update our systems and operating procedures, including for managing personally identifiable information (“PII”), if necessary, to comply with all local data and related consumer protection requirements. In addition, we also maintain operations in the UK. The EU Commission has released a draft decision declaring UK data protection obligations adequate, which if ratified, would allow flow of data from the EU to the UK with the same benefits as those when the UK was part of the EU. If the decision is not ratified, we will be required to follow additional procedures, including implementing standard contract clauses approved by the EU to transfer data adequacy for processing or storage in the UK. If adequacy is not ratified, Wejo is well-positioned to continue to transfer data between the UK and the EU. Failure to comply with any of the laws and regulations discussed in this section can result in fines and penalties. For example, failing to comply with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. If at any time our platform or operations are found noncompliant with these requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.

obligations imposed by any of the above laws and regulations or any similar laws and regulations that may apply to our current and future business will impact our business. 
Human Capital Resources
Oversight and Management
Attracting, developing and retaining top talent is key to our growth, and our success depends on cultivating an engaged and motivated workforce. Our goal is to create a welcoming, diverse and inclusive environment for all our employees, and the tone is set from the top. Our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters. For example, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight of the environmental, social, governance trends, issues and concerns. In addition, our Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, developing and reviewing executive management succession plans and reviewing the Company’s compensation policies for executives. Our Human Resources department is tasked with managing employee-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, compensation and benefits, performance management, and learning and development. In addition, our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues.
Wejo strives to foster the best possible work environment for all employees. Integrity, honesty, and sound judgment are fundamental to our reputation and success. We comply with laws, rules and regulations, holding ourselves to high standards of ethical business conduct in every aspect of our business dealings. We have a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), which sets forth the basic guidelines that we all must follow. The Code of Conduct serves as a guide for what to do when faced with legal or ethical questions and promotes the high ethical standards to which we are committed.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2021, Wejo had 296 employees, which included 253 permanent employees and 43 non-permanent employees, of which 38% are in our commercial office, including our Sales & Marketing employees, and 35% are in Technology, with the rest making up our support functions. Geographically, as of December 31, 2021, 81% of our employees were located in UK, 16% were located in the U.S., and the remaining 3% were located in Japan and elsewhere in Europe. In addition to the 253 permanent employees, Wejo had 43 contract-based, non-permanent employees; 1 such employee was based in the U.S., 36 such employees were in the UK; and 6 such employees were elsewhere in Europe.
None of Wejo’s employees are represented by a labor union, and Wejo considers its relations with its employees to be good. To date, Wejo has not experienced any work stoppages. 
Employee Compensation, Benefits and Wellness
We consider our people to be crucial to our success, meaning we value the importance of attracting and retaining the best talent. We offer market competitive compensation packages including equity and retirement benefits for all employees, with UK leaders and managers and all U.S. employees receiving healthcare benefits.
We value the importance of mental wellness and health, and promote regular work breaks and protected personal time. We are also committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of everyone. Where required, we provide home-office furniture, including ergonomic chairs and desks to ensure people’s working conditions are appropriate. We believe this contributes to our low work-related personnel injury rate. 
Employee Engagement
A key focus is the employee experience through communication, engagement, alignment and feeling valued. We strive to continually improve all elements of engagement through surveys, monthly all-hands briefings, social events, our internal intranet, goals and regular 1:2:1’s. While none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, we do have employee representatives for the purpose of information sharing and consultation. This channel is used to communicate matters of interest affecting employees and social/charities. We review best practice in order to improve ways of working, including policy, legislative changes and/or employment terms. 
Leadership Development and Training
Other key focus areas are Leadership Development and Success Management. We support career development by designing and investing in resources such as our Success Management tool designed to identify strengths and development areas by department. All employees have access to a blended solution of learning support, ranging from induction and on-the-job-training to e-learning solutions and coaching and professional development. We are also investing in our leadership population specifically, with our key signature programs aimed at building high performing teams and leading through change. Our learning and development strategy is aimed at building capability for today and the future and investing in our employee’s careers within Wejo.

Diversity & Inclusion
We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, citizenship status, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, or any other status protected by applicable law. Our management team and employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets standards for appropriate behavior, and are required to attend annual training on the Code of Conduct.
Wejo does not in any way or under any circumstances tolerate or ignore bullying, harassment, or victimization, and therefore the Company treats all allegations and situations seriously. We also sponsor charities for the good of embracing life's differences. We govern ourselves through our commitment to diversity and equality through our Equality, Diversity and Discrimination Policy, which embraces individual viewpoints, cultures, preferences and experiences.
