Item 1. Business
Overview
Varex Imaging Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 2016, is a leading innovator, designer and manufacturer of X-ray imaging components, which include X-ray tubes, digital flat panel detectors and linear accelerators, which are key components of X-ray imaging systems. On January 28, 2017, Varian Medical Systems, Inc. ("Varian") completed its separation and distribution of Varex. In connection with the distribution, Varex became an independent publicly-traded company and is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker “VREX” with 37.4 million shares of common stock distributed to Varian shareholders. With a 65+ year history of successful innovation, Varex’s components are used in medical imaging as well as in industrial and security imaging applications. Global OEM manufacturers of X-ray imaging systems use the company’s X-ray sources, digital detectors, connecting devices and imaging software as components in their systems to detect, diagnose and protect. 
On May 1, 2017, we acquired the Medical Imaging business of PerkinElmer, Inc. ("Acquired Detector Business") for $273.3 million. The acquisition consisted of PerkinElmer Medical Holdings, Inc. and Dexela Limited, together with certain assets of PKI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to digital flat panel detectors that serve as components for industrial, medical, dental and veterinary X-ray imaging systems. The acquired business included approximately 280 employees with operations in Santa Clara, California as well as operations in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 
Our products are sold in three geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. The Americas includes North America (primarily the United States) and Latin America. EMEA includes Europe, Russia, the Middle East, India and Africa. APAC includes Asia and Australia. Revenues by region are based on the known final destination of products sold.
Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets, the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers. We continue to invest in research and development and have over 500 engineers (including 55 with a doctorate degree) in the company. Combining this focus on innovation and product performance with strong long-term customer relationships allows us to partner with our customers to bring industry-leading products to the x-ray imaging market. In addition, total product lifecycle cost is important. We continue to improve the life and quality of our imaging components and leverage our scale as the largest x-ray imaging component supplier to provide cost effective solutions.
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), evaluates the product groupings and measures the business performance in two reportable operating segments: Medical and Industrial. The segments align our products and service offerings with customer use in medical and industrial markets and are consistent with how the CODM evaluates the business for the allocation of resources. The CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the financial performance of each operating segment primarily based on revenues and gross margin.
Medical
2

In our Medical business segment, we design, manufacture, sell and service X-ray imaging components for use in a range of applications, including radiographic and fluoroscopic imaging, mammography, computed tomography (“CT”), radiation therapy and computer-aided detection. We provide a broad range of X-ray imaging components for medical customers, including X-ray tubes, digital flat panel image detectors, high voltage connectors, image-processing software and workstations, computer-aided diagnostic software, collimators, automatic exposure control devices, generators, ionization chambers and buckys.
A significant portion of our revenues come from the sales of high-end X-ray tubes used in CT imaging and high-end dynamic digital detectors used in fluoroscopic and dental applications. These upper-tier imaging components are characterized by increased levels of technological complexity, engineering and intellectual property that typically allow these products to have a higher sales price and gross margin.
The digital flat panel detector market continues to mature from initial product introductions more than 10 years ago. For the past few years, we have experienced price erosion for these products, predominantly in the highly-competitive market for radiographic detectors. We anticipate this trend will continue in the foreseeable future.
Our X-ray imaging components are primarily sold to imaging system original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers that incorporate them into their medical diagnostic, radiation therapy, dental and veterinary imaging systems. To a much lesser extent, we also sell our X-ray imaging components to independent service companies, distributors and directly to end-users for replacement purposes.
Industrial
In our Industrial business segment, we design, manufacture, sell and service products for use in security and industrial inspection applications, such as airport security screening at ports and borders and nondestructive examination in a variety of applications. The products include Linatron X-ray accelerators, X-ray tubes, digital flat panel detectors, high voltage connectors and image-processing software that we generally sell to OEM customers that incorporate these products into their inspection systems.
The security market primarily consists of airport security (carry-on baggage, checked baggage and palletized cargo) and cargo screening at ports and borders. The end customers for border protection systems are typically government agencies, many of which are in oil-based economies and war zones. In 2015, we saw a significant decline in demand for border protection systems due to the volatility of oil prices with moderate increases in demand in the following years.
The non-destructive testing market utilizes x-ray imaging to scan items for inspection of manufacturing defects and product integrity in a wide range of industries including the aerospace, automotive, food packaging, metal castings and 3D printing industries. We provide x-ray sources, digital flat panel detectors, high voltage connectors and image processing software to OEM customers, system integrators and manufacturers. In addition, new applications for x-ray sources are being developed, such as sterilization of food and its packaging. 
Customers
Varex’s customers are primarily large OEMs. Its top five customers, measured by revenue, are Toshiba Medical Systems, Hologic, Inc., Hitachi Ltd., General Electric Company and Varian, which collectively accounted for approximately 34% of Varex’s revenues in fiscal year 2017. Varex’s largest customer, Toshiba Medical Systems, accounted for approximately 19%, 23% and 26% of its total revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The loss of one or more of Varex’s top customers would have a material and adverse effect on Varex’s business. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Varex sells its products to a limited number of OEM customers, many of which are also its competitors, and a reduction in or loss of business of one or more of these customers may materially reduce its sales.”
Competition
The imaging components market is highly competitive. Our OEM customers may choose to develop and manufacture the components in-house or they may choose to out-source to a supplier such as Varex or other providers of imaging components. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets, the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development focused on innovation, product performance and improving the quality and cost of our imaging components. Significant capital investment is required for imaging

component manufacturers and Varex leverages its high volume to reduce its per-unit costs by spreading the fixed costs over more units.
Medical
Varex often competes with the in-house X-ray tube manufacturing operations of major diagnostic imaging systems companies, which are the primary OEM customers for Varex’s Medical products. In order to effectively compete with these in-house
alternatives, Varex must have a competitive advantage in one or more significant areas, such as superior technology and performance,
better product quality or lower product cost. Consequently, Varex sells a significant volume of its X-ray tubes to OEM customers that have in-house X-ray tube production capability. In addition, Varex competes with some OEM customers, such as Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation and Dunlee, a division of Philips Healthcare, who sell X-ray tubes to other manufacturers, and other non-OEMs, such as Industria Applicazioni Elettroniche S.p.A, as well as emerging X-ray tube manufacturers in China. High capital costs and mastery of complex manufacturing processes that drive production yield and product life are significant characteristics of the X-ray tubes business.
The market for digital flat panel detectors is also very competitive. Varex sells its digital flat panel detectors to a number of OEM customers that incorporate Varex’s flat panel detectors into their medical diagnostic, radiation therapy, dental, veterinary and industrial imaging systems. Varex’s amorphous silicon based flat panel detector technology and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ("CMOS") technology competes with other detector technologies, such as amorphous selenium, charge-coupled devices and variations of amorphous silicon scintillators. Varex believes that its products provide a competitive advantage due to product quality and performance and lower overall product lifecycle costs. In the digital flat panel detector market, Varex primarily competes against Trixell S.A.S., Canon, Inc., Vieworks Co., Ltd., and Hamamatsu Corporation, as well as emerging low-cost manufacturers from China such as iRay Technology (Shanghai) Limited, and Jiangsu CareRay Medical Systems Co., Ltd.
Industrial
In the Industrial segment, Varex competes with other OEM suppliers, such as General Electric, Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Nuctech Company Limited (“Nuctech”) and Comet AG. While there are other manufacturers of low-energy X-ray tubes and digital flat panel detectors for specialized and niche industrial applications, Varex’s products are designed for a broad range of applications in inspection, analysis, and testing. In the high-energy market, Varex competes against technologies from Nuctech, Siemens AG, and Foton Ltd., whose X-ray sources are used in applications that include cargo and container scanning, border security, aerospace applications, castings and pressure vessel inspections.
Customer Services and Support
Varex generally warrants its products for 12 to 24 months. In certain cases, the warranty also may be specified by usage metrics such as number of scans. It provides technical advice and consultation to major OEM customers from its US offices in Utah, Nevada, South Carolina, New York and Illinois; and internationally in the Philippines, China, Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan. Varex’s applications specialists and engineers make recommendations to meet the customer’s technical requirements within the customer’s budgetary constraints. Varex often develops specifications for a unique product that will be designed and manufactured to meet a specific customer’s requirements.
Manufacturing and Supplies
Varex manufactures its products in Salt Lake City, Utah; Santa Clara, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Liverpool, New York; Downers Grove, Illinois; Dinxperlo and Heerlen, the Netherlands; Walluf and Bremen, Germany; and Calamba City, Philippines. These facilities employ state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques and several have been honored by the press, governments and trade organizations for their commitment to quality improvement. These manufacturing facilities are certified by International Standards Organization (“ISO”) under ISO 9001 (for industrial products) or ISO 13485 (for medical devices). In addition, Varex has service centers in North Charleston, South Carolina; Willich, Germany; and Wuxi, China. The combined medical and industrial manufacturing infrastructure enables Varex to leverage production scale to achieve productivity and low cost advantage as well as research and development synergies.
Manufacturing processes at Varex’s various facilities include machining, fabrication, subassembly, system assembly and final testing. Varex has invested in various automated and semi-automated equipment for the fabrication and machining of the parts and assemblies that it incorporates into its products. Varex may, from time to time, invest further in such equipment. Varex’s quality 
4

assurance program includes various quality control measures from inspection of raw materials, purchased parts and assemblies through in-line inspection. In some cases, Varex may outsource the manufacturing of sub-assemblies while still performing system design, final assembly and testing in-house. In such cases, Varex believes outsourcing enables it to reduce or maintain fixed costs and capital expenditures, while also providing it with the flexibility to increase production capacity. Varex purchases material and components from various suppliers that are either standard products or customized to its specifications. Some of the components included in Varex’s products may be sourced from a limited group of suppliers or from a single source supplier, such as the wave guides for linear accelerators; transistor arrays and cesium iodide coatings for flat panel detectors and specialized integrated circuits, X-ray tube targets, housings, bearings and various other components. Varex requires certain raw materials, such as copper, lead, tungsten, rhenium, molybdenum zirconium, and various high grades of steel alloy for X-ray tubes and industrial products. Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and Varex expects that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future.
Research and Development
Developing products, systems and services based on advanced technology is essential to Varex’s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. It maintains a research and development and engineering staff responsible for product design and engineering. 
Research and development is primarily conducted at Varex’s Salt Lake City, Utah; San Jose and Santa Clara, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Liverpool, New York; Lincolnshire and Downers Grove, Illinois facilities domestically and at its Netherlands, United Kingdom and Germany facilities internationally, and is primarily focused on developing and improving imaging component technology. Current X-ray source development areas include smaller footprint linear accelerators, improvements to tube life and tube stability, reductions of tube noise and tube designs that will enable OEMs to continue to reduce dose delivered, and improve image resolution, cost effectively. Research in digital flat panel imaging technology is aimed at developing new panel technologies with better dose utilization, improved image quality, lower product costs and new image processing tools for advanced applications.
Industrial products share some of the same base technology competencies and platforms as medical products and Varex’s medical and industrial development teams are therefore co-located in Salt Lake City, San Jose, Santa Clara, Dinxperlo, and in Walluf. One of Varex’s competitive advantages is that some of the foundational technologies and software components developed for medical applications may also be applicable in industrial components, and vice versa. In addition to these product development synergies, Varex is also able to realize sourcing, production, service center, and logistics synergies across the different markets.
Product and Other Liabilities
Varex’s business exposes it to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture, sale, installation, servicing and support of X-ray imaging devices, related software and other devices that contain hazardous material and/or deliver radiation. Because its products are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body and other situations where people may come in contact with radiation (for example, when Varex’s Industrial products are being used to scan cargo) as well as the detection, planning and treatment of medical problems, the possibility for significant injury and/or death exists. Varex may face substantial liability to patients, its customers and others for damages resulting from the faulty, or allegedly faulty, design, manufacture, installation, servicing, support, testing or interoperability of Varex’s and its customers’ products, or their misuse or failure. Varex may also be subject to claims for property damages or economic loss related to or resulting from any errors or defects in its products, or the installation, servicing and support of its products. Any accident or mistreatment could subject Varex to legal costs, litigation, adverse publicity and damage to Varex’s reputation, whether or not its products or services were a factor. In addition, if a product Varex designs or manufactures were defective (whether due to design, labeling or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons), or found to be so by a competent regulatory authority, Varex may be required to correct or recall the product and notify other regulatory authorities. Varex maintains limited product liability, professional liability and omissions liability insurance coverage.
Government Regulation
U.S. Regulations
Laws governing marketing a medical device. In the United States, as a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices emitting radiation or utilizing radioactive by-product material, Varex and some of its suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by federal governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and state and local regulatory agencies, such as the State of California, to ensure the devices are 
5

safe and effective and comply with laws governing products which emit, produce or control radiation. Similar international regulations apply overseas. These regulations, which include the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) and regulations promulgated by the FDA, govern, among other things, the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale and marketing and disposal of medical devices, post market surveillance and reporting of serious injuries and death, repairs, replacements, recalls and other matters relating to medical devices, radiation emitting devices and devices utilizing radioactive by-product material. State regulations are extensive and vary from state to state. Varex’s X-ray tube products, imaging workstations and flat panel detectors are considered medical devices. Under the FDC Act, each medical device manufacturer must comply with quality system regulations that are strictly enforced by the FDA.
Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that the manufacturer of a new medical device or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, existing currently marketed medical device obtain either 510(k) pre-market notification clearance or pre-market approval (“PMA”) before it can market or sell those products in the United States. The 510(k) clearance process is applicable when the device introduced into commercial distribution is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. The process of obtaining 510(k) clearance generally takes at least six months from the date the application is filed, but could take significantly longer, and generally requires submitting supporting testing data. After a product receives 510(k) clearance, any modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process may require a new 510(k) clearance. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s decision, it may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a request for 510(k) pre-market notification clearance and can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the product until 510(k) clearance is obtained. The FDA has issued draft guidance that, if finalized and implemented, will result in manufacturers needing to seek a significant number of new clearances for changes made to legally marketed devices. If we cannot establish that a proposed product is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, we must seek pre-market approval through a PMA application. Under the PMA process, the applicant submits extensive supporting data, including, in most cases, data from clinical studies, in the PMA application to establish reasonable evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product. This process typically takes at least one to two years from the date the PMA is accepted for filing, but can take significantly longer for the FDA to review. Most of Varex’s products are Class I medical devices, which do not require 510(k) clearance. 
Quality systems. Varex’s manufacturing operations for medical devices, and those of its third-party manufacturers, are required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design, testing, and manufacturing quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. The QSR requires that each manufacturer establish a quality systems program by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices. QSR compliance is necessary to receive and maintain FDA clearance or approval to market new and existing products. The FDA makes announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the QSR. If in connection with these inspections the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue observations that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If FDA inspection observations are not addressed and/or corrective action taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a Warning Letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action. Failure to respond timely to FDA inspection observations, a Warning Letter or other notice of noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the total shutdown of Varex’s production facilities, denial of importation rights to the United States for products manufactured in overseas locations and denial of export rights for U.S. products and criminal and civil fines.
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also regulate advertising and promotion of Varex’s products to ensure that the claims it makes are consistent with its regulatory clearances, that it has adequate and reasonable scientific data to substantiate the claims and that its promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading. Varex may not promote or advertise its products for uses not within the scope of its intended use statement in its clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.
It is also important that Varex’s products comply with electrical safety and environmental standards, such as those of Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”), the Canadian Standards Association (“CSA”), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (“IEC”). In addition, the manufacture and distribution of medical devices utilizing radioactive material requires a specific radioactive material license. For the United States, manufacture and distribution of these radioactive sources and devices also must be in accordance with a model-specific certificate issued by either the NRC or by an Agreement State. In essentially every country and state, installation and service of these products must be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license issued by the applicable 
6

radiation control agency. Service of these products must be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license. Varex is also subject to a variety of additional environmental laws regulating Varex’s manufacturing operations and the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous substances, and which impose liability for the cleanup of any contamination from these substances.
Other applicable U.S. regulations. As a participant in the healthcare industry, Varex is also subject to extensive laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information that it receives, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, including, physician self-referral prohibitions, and false claims laws. From time to time, these laws and regulations may be revised or interpreted in ways that could make it more difficult for Varex’s customers to conduct their businesses, such as recent proposed revisions to the laws prohibiting physician self-referrals, and such revisions could have an adverse effect on the demand for Varex’s products, and therefore its business and results of operations. Varex also must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control and other matters.
The laws and regulations and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change, and Varex cannot predict what effect, if any, changes to these laws and regulations may have on its business. For example, national and state laws regulate privacy and may regulate Varex’s use of data. Furthermore, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to provide that business associates who have access to patient health information provided by hospitals and healthcare providers are now directly subject to HIPAA, including the associated enforcement scheme and inspection requirements.
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
The federal and state governments of the United States establish guidelines and pay reimbursements to hospitals and free-standing clinics for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures under Medicare at the federal level and Medicaid at the state level. Private insurers often establish payment levels and policies based on reimbursement rates and guidelines established by the government.
The federal government and Congress review and adjust rates annually, and from time to time consider various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services in hospitals and free-standing clinics. In the past, Varex has seen demand for its customers’ systems (in which Varex’s products are incorporated) negatively impacted by the uncertainties surrounding reimbursement rates in the United States. State government reimbursement for services is determined pursuant to each state’s Medicaid plan, which is established by state law and regulations, subject to requirements of federal law and regulations.
The provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2012. Specifically, one of the components of the law is a 2.3% excise tax on sales of most medical devices, which may in the future negatively affect Varex’s customers and have an indirect negative effect on Varex’s gross margin, although it was suspended for 2016 and 2017. Other elements of this legislation, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms (including shared savings pilots) and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of Varex’s business, including the demand and availability of its products. Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level, and Varex is unable to predict which, if any, of these proposals will be enacted. In addition, it is possible that changes in administration and policy, including the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act, resulting from the recent U.S. presidential election could result in additional proposals and/or changes to health care system legislation which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Varex believes that the uncertainty created by healthcare reform in the United States has complicated its customers’ decision-making process and, therefore, impacted its business, and may continue to do so.
The sale of medical devices, the referral of patients for diagnostic examinations and treatments utilizing such devices, and the submission of claims to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) seeking reimbursement for such services, are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse.” Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, induce, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of business, including the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed, or for medically unnecessary services. The Office of the Inspector General prosecutes violations of fraud and abuse laws and any violation may result in criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may negatively impact the demand for Varex’s products.
7

Foreign Regulations
Varex’s operations, sales and service of its products outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and may differ significantly from those in the United States. In general, Varex’s products are regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA.
Marketing a medical device internationally. For Varex to market its products internationally, it must obtain clearances or approvals for products and product modifications. Varex is required to affix the CE mark to its products to sell them in member countries of the European Union (“EU”). The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness, which once affixed enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EEA. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside the EU, such as Switzerland and Norway and can assist in the clearance process. To receive permission to affix the CE mark to its medical devices products, Varex must obtain Quality System certification, e.g., ISO 13485, and must otherwise have a quality management system that complies with the EU Medical Device Directive. The ISO promulgates standards for certification of quality assurance operations. Varex is certified as complying with the ISO 9001 for its security and inspection products and ISO 13485 for its medical devices. Several Asian countries, including Japan and China, have adopted regulatory schemes that are comparable, and in some cases more stringent, than the EU scheme. To import medical devices into Japan, the requirements of Japan’s New Medical Device Regulation must be met and a “shonin,” the approval to sell medical products in Japan, must be obtained. Similarly, in China, a registration certification issued by the State Food and Drug Administration and a China Compulsory Certification mark for certain products are required to sell medical devices in that country. Obtaining such certifications on its products can be time-consuming and can cause Varex to delay marketing or sales of certain products in such countries. Similarly, prior to selling a device in Canada, manufacturers of Class II, III and IV devices must obtain a medical device license, though Varex does not currently sell these types of devices in Canada. Additionally, many countries have laws and regulations relating to radiation and radiation safety that also apply to Varex’s products. In most countries, radiological regulatory agencies require some form of licensing or registration by the facility prior to acquisition and operation of an X-ray generating device or a radiation source. The handling, transportation and recycling of radioactive metals and source materials are also highly regulated.
A number of countries, including the members of the EU, have implemented or are implementing regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose, or bear certain disposal costs, of products at the end of a product’s useful life and restrict the use of some hazardous substances in certain products sold in those countries.
Manufacturing and selling a device internationally. Varex is also subject to laws and regulations outside the United States applicable to manufacturers of radiation-producing devices and products utilizing radioactive materials, and laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters, in each case that are often comparable to, if not more stringent than, regulations in the United States. In addition, Varex’s sales of products in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, environmental and product recycling requirements, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. In some countries, Varex relies on its foreign distributors and agents to assist Varex in complying with foreign regulatory requirements.
Other applicable international regulations. In addition to the U.S. laws regarding the privacy and integrity of patient medical information, Varex is subject to similar laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information. Particularly within Europe, data protection legislation is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend toward more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data, as well as enactment of stricter legislation. Varex is also subject to international “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, as well as false claims and misleading advertisement laws. Varex also must comply with numerous international laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control and other matters.
On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. would have and how such withdrawal would affect Varex.
Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
Varex is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which became effective on July 1, 2011, and the law “On the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation,” which became effective in January 2012. In general, there is a worldwide trend to strengthen anti-
8

corruption laws and their enforcement, and the healthcare industry and medical equipment manufacturers have been particular targets of these investigation and enforcement efforts. Any violation of these laws by Varex or its agents or distributors could create a substantial liability for Varex, subject Varex’s officers and directors to personal liability and also cause a loss of reputation in the market.
Transparency International’s 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index measured the degree to which public sector corruption is perceived to exist in 168 countries/territories around the world, and found that two-thirds of the countries in the index, including many that Varex considers to be high-growth areas for its products, such as China and India, scored below 50, on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt). Varex currently operates in many countries where the public sector is perceived as being more or highly corrupt and its strategic business plans include expanding Varex’s business in regions and countries that are rated as higher risk for corruption activity by Transparency International.
Increased business in higher-risk countries could subject Varex and its officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly. Failure by Varex or its agents or distributors to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could delay its expansion into high-growth markets and could materially and adversely affect its business.
Competition and Trade Compliance Laws
Varex is subject to various competition and trade compliance laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Regulatory authorities under whose laws Varex operates may have enforcement powers that can subject Varex to sanctions, and can impose changes or conditions in the way Varex conducts its business. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to seek damages asserting claims of anti-competitive conduct. Increased government scrutiny of Varex’s actions or enforcement or private rights of action could materially and adversely affect its business or damage its reputation. In addition, Varex may conduct, or it may be required to conduct, internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies, which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert its management and key personnel from its business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject Varex to fines or criminal or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect Varex’s business and financial results. Furthermore, competition laws may prohibit or increase the cost of future acquisitions that Varex may desire to undertake.
International sales of certain of our Linatron X-ray accelerators are subject to U.S. export licenses that are issued at the discretion of the U.S. government. Orders and revenues for our security and inspection products have been and may continue to be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place large orders with us or with our OEM customers over a short period of time and then may not place additional orders until complete deployment and installation of previously ordered products. We have seen domestic and international governments postpone purchasing decisions and delay installations of products for security and inspection systems. Furthermore, tender awards in this business may be subject to challenge by third parties, as we have previously encountered, which can make the conversion of orders to revenues unpredictable for some security and inspection products. The market for border protection systems has slowed significantly and end customers, particularly in oil-based economies and war zones in which we have a significant customer base, are delaying system deployments or tenders and have considered moving to alternative sources.
Intellectual Property
Varex places considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes, because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and to the marketplace.
Varex generally relies upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title, including confidentiality agreements with vendors, strategic partners, co-developers, employees, consultants and other third parties, to protect Varex’s proprietary rights in the developments, improvements and inventions that Varex has originated and which are incorporated in its products or that fall within its fields of interest. As of September 29, 2017, Varex owns over 250 patents issued in the United States, over 170 patents issued throughout the rest of the world and had over another 100 patent applications on file with various patent agencies worldwide. The patents and patents issuing from the pending applications generally expire between 2017 and 2035. Varex intends to file additional patent applications as appropriate. Varex has trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for its products in the marketplace. Varex also has agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary

technology, including royalty-bearing licenses and technology cross-licenses. These licenses generally can only be terminated for breach.
In conjunction with the separation, Varex and Varian entered into an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, each of Varex and Varian granted the other licenses to use certain intellectual property.
Environmental Matters
Varex’s operations and facilities, past and present, are subject to environmental laws, including laws that regulate the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous substances. Certain of those laws impose cleanup liabilities under certain circumstances. In connection with those laws and certain of Varex’s past and present operations and facilities, Varex is obligated to indemnify Varian for 20% of the cleanup liabilities related to corporate, discontinued or sold operations prior to the 1999 separation and distribution (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds or tax benefits received by Varian), as well as fully indemnify Varian for other liabilities arising from the operations of the business transferred to it as part of the separation. Those include facilities sold as part of Varian’s electron devices business in 1995 and thin film systems business in 1997. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or third parties have named Varian as a potentially responsible party under the amended Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), at sites to which Varian or the facilities of the businesses sold in 1995 and 1997 were alleged to have shipped waste for recycling or disposal (the “CERCLA sites”). It is anticipated that Varex will be obligated to reimburse Varian for 20% of the liabilities of Varian related to these CERCLA sites (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds or tax benefits received by Varian). In connection with the CERCLA sites, to date Varian has been required to pay only a small portion of the total amount as its contribution to the cleanup efforts and Varex anticipates that any reimbursement to Varian in the future will not be material. 
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
Varex does business globally, with manufacturing and research and development in the United States, Europe, Philippines and China, and sales and service operations throughout the world. Approximately two-thirds of Varex’s revenues are generated from its international regions. In addition to the potentially adverse impact of foreign regulations, see “Government Regulation—Foreign Regulations,” Varex also may be affected by other factors related to its international sales, such as: lower average selling prices and profit margins, delays in shipments due to required export licensing, and longer time periods from shipment to cash collection (which increases days sales outstanding (“DSO”)). To the extent that the geographic distribution of Varex’s sales continues to shift more towards international regions, its overall revenues and margins may suffer. Although a significant portion of Varex customers are outside of the United States, its products are generally priced in U.S. Dollars. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the demand for products. 
Varex is also exposed to other economic, political and other risks inherent in doing business globally. For an additional discussion of these risks, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Employees
As of September 29, 2017, Varex had approximately 2,000 full-time and part-time employees worldwide. None of its employees based in the United States are unionized or subject to collective bargaining agreements. Employees based in some foreign countries may, from time to time, be represented by works councils or unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. Varex currently considers its relations with its employees to be good.
