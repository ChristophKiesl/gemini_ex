Intravenous (IV) Tramadol
Our partner company Avenue, in collaboration with InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is developing intravenous (“IV”) Tramadol, for the treatment of post-operative acute pain. IV Tramadol may fill a gap in the acute pain market between IV acetaminophen/NSAIDs and conventional IV narcotics. Avenue announced in May 2018 that its first pivotal Phase 3 study had met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints. In June 2019, Avenue announced that its second pivotal Phase 3 study had met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints. In December 2019, Avenue submitted a new drug application (“NDA”), for IV Tramadol to treat moderate to moderately severe postoperative pain pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). On October 12, 2020, Avenue announced that it had received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding Avenue’s NDA for IV Tramadol. In November 2020, Avenue attended a Type A Meeting with the FDA to discuss issues raised in the CRL. On February 12, 2021 Avenue resubmitted its NDA to the FDA for IV Tramadol. The NDA resubmission follows the receipt of official minutes from a Type A meeting with the FDA, which was conducted following receipt of Avenue’s CRL. The NDA resubmission included revised language relating to the proposed product label and a report relating to terminal sterilization validation. On February 26, 2021, Avenue received an acknowledgement letter from the FDA that Avenue’s resubmission of its NDA is a complete, class 1 response to the CRL, and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date has been set for April 12, 2021.
​
CUTX-101 (Copper Histidinate injection for Menkes Disease)
​
Our partner company Cyprium is currently developing CUTX-101, a copper histidinate injection for the treatment of Menkes disease. Menkes disease is a rare X-linked pediatric disease caused by gene mutations of copper transporter ATP7A, which affects approximately 1 in 34,810 live male births, and potentially as high as 1 in 8,664 live male births, based on recent genome-based ascertainment study. Biochemically, Menkes patients may have low serum copper levels, as well as abnormal levels of catecholamine, but definitive diagnosis is typically made by sequencing of the ATP7A gene. There is no current FDA-approved treatment for Menkes disease. CUTX-101, along with an AAV-ATP7A gene therapy that is also being developed by Cyprium, was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. CUTX-101 was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation by the FDA for the treatment of Menkes disease and Fast Track Designation for classic Menkes disease in patients who have not demonstrated significant clinical progression. The European Medicines Agency “EMA” Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products also granted Orphan Drug Designation for CUTX-101. In August 2020 Cyprium reported positive top-line clinical efficacy results for CUTX-101. In December 2020 the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to CUTX-101. Additional information on the Expanded Access study can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT04074512. Cyprium intends to begin the rolling submission of a NDA to the FDA for CUTX-101 in the second half of 2021.
​
On February 24, 2021, Cyprium announced the execution of an asset purchase agreement with Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sentynl”), a U.S.-based specialty pharmaceutical company owned by the Zydus Group. The asset purchase agreement commits Sentynl to an upfront cash payment to Cyprium of $8.0 million, which was paid upon execution of the agreement, and $12.0 million in future development and regulatory cash milestones through NDA approval, as well as potential sales milestones. Royalties on CUTX-101 net sales ranging from the mid-single digits up to the mid-twenties are also payable. Cyprium will retain development responsibility of CUTX-101 through approval of the NDA by the FDA, and Sentynl will be responsible for commercialization of CUTX-101 as well as progressing newborn screening activities. Continued development of CUTX-101 will be overseen by a Joint Steering Committee consisting of representatives from Cyprium and Sentynl. Cyprium will retain 100% ownership over any FDA priority review voucher that may be issued at NDA approval for CUTX-101.

MB-107 and MB-207 (Ex vivo Lentiviral Therapy for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID))
Our partner company Mustang collaborates with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”) in the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for the treatment of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (“XSCID”), also known as bubble boy disease. On August 2, 2018, Mustang entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with St. Jude for the development of this therapy. XSCID is the most common form of severe combined immune deficiency. The acquisition of this license expands our pipeline into gene therapy, allowing us to leverage existing synergies for Mustang’s Worcester, Massachusetts, cell-processing facility. This gene therapy is currently in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials involving two different autologous cell products: a multicenter trial of the MB-107 product in newly diagnosed infants sponsored by St. Jude (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01512888) and a single-center trial of the MB-207 product in previously transplanted patients sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01306019). In April 2020, the EMA granted Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (“ATMP”) classification to MB-107. The FDA also previously granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation to MB-107 in August 2019. In the third quarter of 2020, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to both MB-107 and MB-207. 
​
In May 2020, Mustang submitted an Investigational New Product Drug Application (“IND”) application with the FDA to initiate a registrational multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of MB-107 in newly diagnosed infants with XSCID who are under the age of two. In response, the FDA identified CMC hold issues that Mustang satisfactorily addressed in a December 2020 submission to the Agency, and the CMC hold was removed in January 2021. Potential topline data from the trial are expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Mustang expects to file an IND in the second quarter of 2021 for a registrational multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of MB-207 in previously transplanted XSCID patients. Potential topline data from this trial are expected in the first half of 2023.
Cosibelimab (Anti-PD-L1 mAb for mCSCC and NSCLC)
Our partner company Checkpoint is currently evaluating its lead antibody product candidate, cosibelimab (formerly CK-301), an anti-PD-L1 antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in Checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, including ongoing cohorts intended to support one or more Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submissions. Additional information on the Phase 1 trial can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT03212404. Checkpoint also has a collaboration agreement with TG Therapeutics, Inc. (“TGTX”) whereby TGTX was granted the rights to develop and commercialize cosibelimab in the field of hematological malignancies.
In September 2020, Checkpoint announced interim results from the registration-enabling Phase 1 clinical trial in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“mCSCC”) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Virtual Congress 2020. Checkpoint expects top-line results from the trial in the second half of 2021.
In November 2020, Checkpoint announced updated results from the ongoing global, open-label, multicohort Phase 1 clinical trial including a cohort of patients with previously untreated high PD-L1 expressing advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).
CK-101 (EGFR inhibitor for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC)
Checkpoint is also currently evaluating a lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, CK-101, in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In September 2018, Checkpoint announced preliminary interim safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. The data were presented in an oral presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (“IASLC”) 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto. The clinical trial is ongoing to identify the optimal dose to maximize therapeutic effect, following which a Phase 3 trial is planned in treatment-naïve EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients. Additional information on the Phase 1 trial can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT02926768.

In November 2020, NeuPharma, Inc. commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in China evaluating CK-101 in treatment-naïve locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. We intend to meet with the FDA to discuss the adequacy of the ongoing Phase 3 trial in China.
​
CAEL-101 (mAb for AL Amyloidosis)
Our partner company Caelum, in collaboration with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alexion”), is working to develop a novel, first-in-class monoclonal antibody called CAEL-101 for the treatment of amyloid light chain (“AL”) amyloidosis. CAEL-101 is designed to improve organ function by reducing or eliminating amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs of patients with AL amyloidosis. The antibody is designed to bind to insoluble light chain amyloid protein, including both kappa and lambda subtypes. In a Phase 1a/1b study, CAEL-101 demonstrated improved organ function, including cardiac and renal function, in 27 patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis who had previously not had an organ response to standard of care therapy. These data support CAEL-101’s potential to be a well-tolerated therapy that promotes amyloid resolution. In a Phase 2 dose escalation study, safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 supported the selection of the 1000 mg/m2 dose for the Phase 3 studies. CAEL-101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA as a therapy for patients with AL amyloidosis, and as a radio-imaging agent in AL amyloidosis.
In September 2020 Caelum initiated two Phase 3 studies of CAEL-101 for AL amyloidosis. Additional information on the Phase 3 trials, both of which are actively enrolling patients, can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifiers NCT04512235 and NCT04504825.
In December 2020, AstraZeneca (“AZ”) announced its intention to acquire Alexion, with the acquisition expected to close by the third quarter of 2021, as the acquisition is subject to approval by both AZ and Alexion shareholders, as well as certain regulatory approvals, share listing approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition of Alexion by AZ triggers the Change of Control clause in the Amended and Restated Development, Option and Stock Purchase Agreement entered into by and among Caelum, Alexion, the Company, and Caelum security holders, such that Alexion’s purchase option expires on the date that is six months after the closing of any Change of Control.
Triplex (Vaccine for Cytomegalovirus) 
Through our partner company Helocyte, we are developing Triplex, a universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine engineered to induce a rapid, robust and durable virus-specific T cell response to three immuno-dominant proteins (UL83 (pp65), UL123 (IE1), and UL122 (IE2)) linked to cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) complications in the transplant setting. In a Phase 1 study, Triplex was found to be safe, well-tolerated and highly immunogenic when administered to healthy volunteers at multiple dose levels (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01941056). In a Phase 2 trial, Triplex was observed to be safe, well-tolerated, highly immunogenic and efficacious in reducing CMV events in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02506933). Triplex is currently the subject of multiple other ongoing and planned studies, one involving vaccination of the stem cell transplant donor (followed by vaccination of the recipient) in higher risk patients. Helocyte will potentially initiate studies of Triplex for CMV control in recipients of kidney and liver transplant. Helocyte secured an exclusive, worldwide license to Triplex from City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”) in April of 2015.
CEVA101 (Cellular Therapeutic for Severe Traumatic Brain Injury) 
Through our partner company, Cellvation, we are developing CEVA101, a cellular product comprised of autologous Bone Marrow-derived Mononuclear Cells (“BMMNCs”) currently being developed for the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) in adults and children. In separate Phase 1 trials of adults and children with severe TBI, CEVA101 was observed to be safe, well-tolerated and efficacious (resulting in volumetric preservation versus time-matched controls, and in the case of children, reducing the Pediatric Intensity Level of Therapy or PILOT score), see ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT01575470 and NCT0254722.
In a recently-completed, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 study of children with severe TBI, CEVA101 was similarly observed to be safe, well-tolerated and efficacious (resulting in volumetric preservation and a 

9



reduction in the PILOT score of those receiving CEVA101 versus those receiving placebo), see ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01851083). A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of CEVA101 for the treatment of severe TBI in adults is ongoing (see ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02525432). In 2017, Cellvation secured RMAT designation for CEVA101 in the treatment of severe TBI. The RMAT designation is expected to facilitate expedited development and review of CEVA101. Cellvation secured an exclusive worldwide license to CEVA101 (as well as CEVA-D and CEVA102) from University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston in October of 2016. 
Early Stage Product Candidates
MB-102 (CD123 CAR T for BPDCN) 
Our partner company Mustang collaborates with COH and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“Fred Hutch”) in the development of proprietary, autologous, chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) engineered T-cell (“CAR T”) therapies. CAR T therapies use the patient’s own T-cells to engage and destroy specific tumors. The process involves selecting specific T-cell subtypes, genetically engineering them to express chimeric antigen receptors and placing them back in the patient where they recognize and destroy cancer cells. We believe that harnessing the body’s own immune system to treat cancer is the next generation of cancer care that may prove curative across tumor types that have proved resistant to standard pharmacological and biological treatments.
One such CAR T is CD123 or MB-102, a subunit of the heterodimeric interleukin-3-receptor (“IL-3R”), which is widely expressed on human hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). In addition, CD123 can be found on the surface of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”), myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”), chronic myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma.
Mustang is currently investigating MB-102 as a target for adoptive cellular immunotherapy in BPDCN, since high CD123 expression is associated with enhanced malignant cell proliferation, increased resistance of these cells to apoptosis, and poor clinical prognosis. Depending on the early results in this patient population, Mustang may broaden the inclusion criteria to include AML and high-risk MDS. CD123 is overexpressed in the vast majority of cases of AML and high-risk MDS and in essentially all cases of BPDCN. 
In October 2020, Mustang announced the dosing of the first patient in a multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MB-102 in patients with relapsed or refractory BPDCN (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04109482). This is also the first clinical trial under a Mustang IND in which a patient was dosed with cells processed in Mustang’s own manufacturing facility. 
MB-101 (IL13Rα2 CAR T for Glioblastoma)
Mustang is also currently developing MB-101, an optimized CAR T product incorporating enhancements in CAR T design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell persistence. Having optimized dose, schedule, route of administration and T cell selection, a Phase 1 trial is currently underway at COH combining MB-101 with immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”). Additional information on the trial can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT04003649. 
In December 2020, Mustang and COH announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial of MB-101 to treat patients with leptomeningeal brain tumors (e.g. glioblastoma, ependymoma, or medulloblastoma) and additional information on the trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov using identifier NCT04661384. In 2021, Mustang expects to initiate a trial of MB-101 in combination with MB-108, an oncolytic virus in-licensed from Nationwide Children’s Hospital, with the goal of potentially enhancing efficacy in treating GBM.
GBM is the most common brain and central nervous system (“CNS”) cancer, accounting for 45.2% of malignant primary brain and CNS tumors, 54% of all gliomas, and 16% of all primary brain and CNS tumors. More than 13,000 new glioblastoma cases were predicted in the U.S. for 2020. Malignant brain tumors are the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and the most common cancer occurring among 15-19 year-olds in the U.S. While GBM is a rare disease (2-3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the US and EU), it is quite lethal, with five-year survival rates historically under 10%. Standard of care therapy consists of maximal surgical resection, radiation, 

10



and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, is shown to extend median overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains difficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.
Immunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Rα2 is an attractive target for CAR T therapy, as it has limited expression in normal tissue but is over-expressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBM tumors. CAR T cells are designed to express membrane-tethered IL-13 receptor ligand mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y) with high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced binding to IL13Rα1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon KS et al. Cancer Research. 2004;64:9160-9166).
MB-104 (CS1 CAR T for Multiple Myeloma and Light Chain Amyloidosis)
Another Mustang program is a CAR T directed against CS1 (also known as CD319, CRACC and SLAMF7), which was identified as an NK cell receptor regulating immune functions. It is also expressed on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, NK-T cells, and monocytes. CS1 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (“MM”) and light chain amyloidosis (“AL”), which makes it a good target for immunotherapy. A humanized anti-CS1 antibody, elotuzumab (Empliciti®), is approved in combination with other medications for the treatment of adult patients with MM who have received prior therapies. Despite great advances in treatment, MM remains an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. AL is a protein deposition disorder that is a result of a plasma cell dysplasia, similar to MM. Immunotherapy is an attractive approach for AL because of the low burden of disease. Our academic partners at COH have developed a novel second generation CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy. In preclinical studies, they have demonstrated efficacy of these CAR T cells, both in vitro and in vivo, within the context of clinically relevant models of MM and AL. COH is evaluating the safety of this CS1-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03710421). Once COH has established a safe and effective dose for MB-104 in this trial, Mustang expects to file an IND for a multicenter Phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of patients with MM.
MB-106 (CD20 CAR T for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma)
CD20 is a B-cell lineage-specific phosphoprotein that is expressed in high, homogeneous density on the surface of more than 95% of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). CD20 is stable on the cell surface with minimal shedding or internalization upon binding antibody and is present at only nanomolar levels as soluble antigen. It is well established as an effective immunotherapy target, with extensive studies demonstrating improved tumor responses and survival of B-NHL patients treated with rituximab and other anti-CD20 antibodies. A CD20-targeted third-generation autologous CAR T cell therapy is being developed by our partner company Mustang in a collaboration with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“Fred Hutch”).
More than 70,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed each year in the United States, and more than 19,000 patients die of this group of diseases annually. Most forms of NHL including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma, which account collectively for ~45% of all cases of NHL, are incurable with available therapies, except for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (“allo-SCT”). However, many NHL patients are not suitable candidates for allo-SCT, and this treatment is also limited by significant rates of morbidity and mortality due to graft- versus-host disease. Innovative new treatments are therefore urgently needed.
Fred Hutch has an open IND for a Phase 1/2 clinical study to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering CD20-directed CAR T cells (MB-106) to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03277729). This IND was submitted on February 24, 2017, with Fred Hutch as the sponsor. The trial will also assess CAR T cell persistence and determine the potential immunogenicity of the cells, and Mustang together with Fred Hutch will determine a recommended Phase 2 dose.
​

In December 2020, at the 62nd American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, Mustang and Fred Hutch announced interim data in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MB-106. Following optimization of the cell processing, 9 patients – 7 with follicular lymphoma and 2 with mantle cell lymphoma – were treated at 4 different dose levels ranging from 1x105 CAR T cells/kg to 3.3x106 CAR T cells/kg. The overall response rate was 89% (8/9), and the complete response rate was 44% (4/9). One patient experienced a grade 1 episode of cytokine release syndrome, and no patients experienced immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Mustang also plans to file an IND in the first quarter of 2021 to enable the initiation of a multicenter Phase 1/2 trial of MB-106.
MB-103 (HER2 CAR T for GBM & Metastatic Breast Cancer to Brain)
HER2/neu (often shortened to “HER2”) is a growth-promoting protein on the outside of all breast cells. Breast cancer cells with higher than normal levels of HER2 are called HER2-positive (“HER2+”). These cancers tend to grow and spread faster than other breast cancers. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with over 42,000 women in the United States expected to die from advanced metastatic disease in 2020. Approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancers overexpress HER2, which is an established therapeutic target of both monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. With the advent of effective mAbs directed against HER2, the median overall survival of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer has improved. However, management of metastatic disease in the CNS - observed in up to 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients - continues to be a clinical challenge in large part due to the inability of mAbs to sufficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Although small-molecule inhibitors of HER2 exist and have been clinically approved, their single-agent efficacy in the context of metastatic disease to the brain has been limited. While HER2-targeted therapy in combination with conventional agents has shown some promise for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, control of brain metastases remains a significant unmet clinical need, as most patients survive less than two years following CNS involvement.
CAR-based T-cell immunotherapy is being actively investigated for the treatment of solid tumors, including HER2+ cancers. Mustang’s academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation HER2-specific CAR T-cell for the treatment of refractory/relapsed HER2+ GBM, as well as for the treatment of brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases from HER2+ cancers. COH’s preclinical data demonstrate effective targeting of breast cancer brain metastases with intraventricular delivery of HER2-directed CAR T cells. COH is evaluating the safety of this HER2-specific CAR T cell therapy in two phase 1 trials that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. Additional information on the Phase 1 trials can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifiers NCT03389230 and NCT03696030.
MB-108 (HSV-1 Oncolytic Virus C134)
C134 is a next-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (“oHSV”) that is conditionally replication competent; that is, it can replicate in tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this process. It is currently in development at Mustang. It was in-licensed from Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) is evaluating the safety of this oncolytic virus in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Additional information on the ongoing Phase 1 trial of MB-108 can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT03657576. In 2021 Mustang intends to combine MB-108 with MB-101 to potentially enhance efficacy in treating GBM.
In October 2020 the Phase 1 trial of MB-108 was put on hold due to toxicity at the highest dose level, and UAB expects FDA clearance in the first half of 2021 in order to resume enrolling patients at a lower dose level. As a result of this clinical hold, as well as COVID-19 virus-related accrual delays in 2020, we expect that IND filing for the combination trial of MB-108 with MB-101 will be delayed until the fourth quarter of 2021.

MB-105 (PSCA CAR T for Prostate & Pancreatic Cancers)
Prostate stem-cell antigen (“PSCA”) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell membrane glycoprotein. In addition to being highly expressed in the prostate it is also expressed in the bladder, placenta, colon, kidney, and stomach. Prostate cancer may be amenable to T cell-based immunotherapy since several tumor antigens, including PSCA, are widely over-expressed in metastatic disease. Mustang’s academic partners at COH have developed a second-generation PSCA-specific CAR T cell therapy that has demonstrated robust in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in patient-derived, clinically relevant, bone-metastatic prostate cancer xenograft models. COH is evaluating the safety of this PSCA-specific CAR T cell therapy in a Phase 1 trial treating patients with PSCA+ metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Additional information on this trial can be found on www.ClinicalTrials.gov using identifier NCT03873805.
In October 2020, Mustang announced initial data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with PSCA+-positive castration-resistance prostate cancer (“CRPC”). In a presentation at the Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation Scientific Retreat, the COH principal investigator reported results from a highly refractory patient treated with MB-105 who experienced a 94 percent reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), near complete reduction of measurable soft tissue metastasis by computerized tomography, and improvement in bone metastases by magnetic resonance imaging. Mustang believes additional data could potentially be provided in the second half of 2021.
BAER-101 (novel α2/3–subtype-selective GABA A positive allosteric modulator (“PAM”))
Through our majority-owned partner Baergic, we are developing BAER-101, a high affinity, selective modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (“GABA”) A, which is a receptor system with differential binding and modulatory properties dependent on the particular GABA A subtype. Baergic will explore BAER-101 in a number of CNS disorders where patients are not adequately treated.
Preclinical Product Candidates
AAV-ATP7A Gene Therapy
Through our majority-owned partner Cyprium, we are developing adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) gene therapy (“AAV-ATP7A”). In March 2017, Cyprium entered into a license agreement with Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (“NICHD”) to acquire the global rights to develop and commercialize AAV-ATP7A gene therapy. AAV-ATP7A gene therapy has demonstrated the ability to rescue neurological phenotypes and improve survival when coadministered with copper histidinate injections in a mouse model of Menkes disease and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. 
AVTS-001 Gene Therapy
Through our majority-owned partner Aevitas, we are developing AVTS-001, an AAV gene therapy to treat diseases associated with a dysregulated complement system via AAV delivery of functional short Factor H. Aevitas has licensed an engineered, fully functional shortened version of Factor H which can be packaged by AAV, from the University of Pennsylvania. Aevitas also has a collaboration with University of Massachusetts Medical to optimize AAV constructs. The lead target indications are Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (“Dry AMD”) and autoimmune disorders with high unmet need including atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (also known as “aHUS”) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (also known as “PNH”).
CK-103 (BET Inhibitor)
Checkpoint is currently developing CK-103, a novel, selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) bromodomains. Checkpoint plans to develop CK-103 for the treatment of various advanced and metastatic solid tumor cancers, including, but not limited to, those associated with elevated c-Myc expression. Checkpoint entered into a collaboration with TGTX to develop CK-103 in the field of hematological malignancies. Checkpoint retains the right to develop and commercialize CK-103 in solid tumors.

CEVA-D and CEVA-102 
In partnership with Cellvation, we are developing CEVA-D, a novel bioreactor device that enhances the anti-inflammatory potency of bone marrow-derived cells without genetic manipulation, using wall shear stress (“WSS”) to suppress tumor necrosis factor-a (“TNF-a”) production by activated immune cells. CEVA-102 is the first cell product produced by CEVA-D, which we plan to develop for various indications, including the treatment of severe traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) in adults and children.
CK-302 (Anti-GITR)
CK-302 is a fully human agonistic monoclonal antibody in development at Checkpoint that is designed to bind and trigger signaling in GITR expressing cells. GITR is a co-stimulatory molecule of the TNF receptor family and is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, natural killer (“NK”) and regulatory T cells (“Treg”). Checkpoint is developing CK-302 for oncology indications where scientific literature supports the potential for an anti-GITR to be effective.
CK-303 (Anti-CAIX)
Also in development at Checkpoint is CK-303, a fully human anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”) antibody designed to recognize CAIX expressing cells and kill them via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”). Scientific literature indicates that CAIX is a well characterized tumor associated antigen with expression almost exclusively limited to the cells of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Checkpoint is developing CK-303 for the treatment of patients with RCC in combination with an anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-GITR antibody as well as potentially other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and/or targeted therapies.
ConVax (formerly Pentamer)
We and our partner Helocyte are also developing ConVax, a universal recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara viral vector vaccine designed to induce robust and durable humoral and cellular immune responses to cytomegalovirus (“CMV”). ConVax is currently undergoing nonclinical development.
ONCOlogues (Oligonucleotide Platform)
Our partner company Oncogenuity is developing a delivery platform that allows peptic nucleic acids (“PNAs”) to enter cell membrane and nucleus, displace the targeted mutant DNA strand, and prevent mutant mRNA transcription. The platform has demonstrated in vitro proof-of-concept data in KRAS G12D models and Oncogenuity is seeking to optimize lead candidates targeting genetically driven cancers, including KRAS G12D, and other genetic disorders.
Intellectual Property Generally
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our and our partners’ management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we and our partners currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we and our partners require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Competition
We and our partners operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our and our partners’ competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in research in direct competition with us and our partners. We and our partners also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in biotechnology, biopharmaceutical, dermatological and other therapeutic areas. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts, patient access programs and product insurance coverage reimbursement.
The only pharmaceutical area in which we sell marketed products is dermatology, and the dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC sector. Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology. Competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which our products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts.
Branded products often must compete with therapeutically similar branded or generic products or with generic equivalents. Such competition frequently increases over time. For example, if competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products could be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. To successfully compete for business, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Accordingly, we face pressure to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively.
Our major competitors, including Galderma Laboratories, Vyne Therapeutics, Sol-Gel Technologies, Almirall, Verrica Pharmaceuticals, Cassiopea, MC2 Therapeutics, EPI Health, Sun Pharma, Leo Pharma and Arcutis Biotherapeutics, among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems, among other factors.
​

Generic Competition
Our partner company Journey faces increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to FDA seeking to market generic versions of Journey’s products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in PTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Generic products generally face intense competition from other generic equivalents (including authorized generics) and therapeutically similar branded or generic products.Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we and our partners are developing.
United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical (drug and biological) products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product-development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA compliance and enforcement actions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial compliance or enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a NDA or BLA for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMPs”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

16



The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The process of seeking required approvals before we can market or sell a product, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will automatically result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that causes such clinical trial to be suspended or terminated.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB or ethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party clinical research organizations (“CROs”) to administer and conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from these trials. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards could adversely impact the subject product development program. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is usually introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a larger, but still limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish safety and efficacy, the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, it has been the FDA’s position that Congress intended at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials for approval of an NDA or BLA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be required after initial receipt of marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA after it has been approved, and is on the market, as an ongoing condition of approval.

17



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with CGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected, tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
United States Review and Approval Process
The data and results generated from product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other required information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA submission before the product can be marketed and sold.
The review and approval process for an NDA or BLA is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may not approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or if the data and results in the submission are insufficient to support a finding of safety and efficacy, FDA may also require additional clinical data or other data and information to address deficiencies in an application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited with respect to dosages, indications for use, or other label claims related to those disease states, conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective and, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with CGMPs, which impose additional regulatory requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, our partners, or related suppliers, will be able to fully comply with the CGMPs and other FDA regulatory requirements.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which we or our partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing postmarket regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, compliance and enforcement actions initiated by the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.
​

18



The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA or BLA.
If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug that designated orphan use, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another person if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. If the FDA approves someone else’s application for the same drug that has orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its FDA approval for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs and BLAs or supplements to NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the treatment is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), provides BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a product if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within a specific time frame.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we and our partners receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). The ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the payments received for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. We are unable to predict what these changes may look like following the 2020 election and subsequent change of Administration.
​
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement, and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. Importantly, the level of evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to apply for marketing authorization for a drug candidate differs from country to country, the approval process also varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Typically, if a foreign regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore there are no guarantees that any company will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
