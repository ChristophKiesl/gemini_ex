 ITEM 1.                 BUSINESS
  
  History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006 under the name “Mountain West Business Solutions, Inc.” Until October 2009, our business was to provide management consulting with regard to accounting, computer and general business issues for small and home-office based companies. Effective October 15, 2009, we executed an agreement to acquire Sunshine Biopharma, Inc., a Colorado corporation (subsequently renamed Sunshine Etopo, Inc.), in exchange for the issuance of 21,962,000 shares of our Common Stock and 850,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, each convertible into twenty (20) shares of our Common Stock. As a result of this transaction we changed our name to “Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. and our officers and directors resigned their positions with us and were replaced by our current management. The majority of the Common Shares and all of the Convertible Preferred Shares we issued for this transaction were issued to Advanomics Corporation, a privately held Canadian company (“Advanomics”). As a result of the issuance of this stock, Advanomics became a related party. Advanomics had previously granted Sunshine Biopharma, Inc. an exclusive license for an anticancer drug in development called Adva-27a. On December 21, 2011, Advanomics exercised its right to convert the 850,000 shares of Series “A” Preferred Stock it held in our Company into 17,000,000 shares of Common Stock. There are currently no issued and outstanding shares of the Series “A” Preferred Stock of our company.
  
 Following the above detailed transactions, we began to operate as a pharmaceutical company focusing on development of the Adva-27a anticancer compound. We operated under a the exclusive technology license agreement with Advanomics until December 2015, at which time we acquired all of the worldwide right to the technology and became direct owner of all issued and pending patents pertaining to the Adva-27a technology. Following acquisition of the Adva-27a patents, the exclusive license agreement with Advanomics was terminated and Sunshine Etopo, Inc., Sunshine Biopharma Inc.’s subsidiary holding the exclusive license with Advanomics, was dissolved. See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Intellectual Property,” below.
  
 In July 2014, we formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), for the purposes of offering generic pharmaceutical products in Canada and elsewhere around the globe. Sunshine Canada has recently signed licensing agreements for four (4) generic prescription drugs for the treatment of cancer and BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).
  
 With our entry into the generic pharmaceuticals business, we have become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company offering generic and proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer and other acute and chronic indications.
  
 Our principal place of business is located at 469 Jean-Talon West, 3rd Floor, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3N 1R4. Our phone number is (514) 764-9698 and our website address is www.sunshinebiopharma.com.
  
 We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

  Business Operations
  
 Since inception, we have been operating as a pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of proprietary drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer.  In July 2014, we formed Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc., a Canadian wholly owned subsidiary, for the purposes of conducting generic pharmaceuticals business in Canada and elsewhere around the world. During 2016, we intensified activities in the generic pharmaceuticals area and as a result, in addition to our continued efforts to develop our anti-cancer drug, we also intend to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company offering generic and proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer and other acute and chronic indications. Below we describe our Generic Pharmaceuticals Operations followed by our Proprietary Drug Development Program.
 Generic Pharmaceuticals Operations
  
 In 2016, our Canadian wholly owned subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”), signed Cross Referencing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four prescription generic drugs for the treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. We will market and sell these new pharmaceutical products under our own Sunshine Biopharma label. These four generic products are as follows:
  
   ●
 Anastrozole (brand name Arimidex® by AstraZeneca) for treatment of Breast Cancer;

   ●
 Letrozole (brand name Femara® by Novartis) for treatment of Breast Cancer;

   ●
 Bicalutamide (brand name Casodex® by AstraZenica) for treatment of Prostate Cancer;

   ●
 Finasteride (brand name Propecia® by Merck) for treatment of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)

 
 Worldwide sales of the brand name version of these products as reported in the SEC filing of the respective owner of the registered trademark are as follows:
  
   ●
 Arimidex® $232M in 2016

   ●
 Femara® $380M in 2014

   ●
 Casodex® $247M in 2016

   ●
 Propecia® $183M in 2015

 
 Sunshine Canada is currently in the process of securing a Drug Identification Number (“DIN”) for each of these products from Health Canada. We are also working on finding an appropriate facility and obtaining a Drug Establishment License (“DEL”) from Health Canada. Upon receipt of the DEL and DIN’s, we will be able to accept orders for our own label SBI-Anastrozole, SBI-Letrozole, SBI-Bicalutamide and SBI-Finasteride. We cannot estimate the timing in our obtaining either the DIN or DEL due to variables involved that are out of our control. The Figure below shows our 30-Pill blister pack of Anastrozole.
  
 
 We currently have twenty three (23) additional Generic Pharmaceuticals under review for in-licensing. While no assurances can be provided, when completed, this will bring our Generic Products portfolio to a total of twenty seven (27). We believe that a larger product portfolio provides us with more opportunities and a greater reach into the marketplace. We hope to further build our generics portfolio of “SBI” label Generic Pharmaceuticals over time.

 Various publicly available sources indicate that the worldwide sales of generic pharmaceuticals are approximately $200 billion per year. In the United States and Canada, the sales of generic pharmaceuticals are approximately $50 billion and $5 billion, respectively. The generic pharmaceuticals business is fairly competitive and there are several multinational players in the field including Teva (Israel), Novartis - Sandoz (Switzerland), Hospira (USA), Mylan (Netherlands), Sanofi (France), Fresenius Kabi (Germany) and Apotex (Canada). While no assurances can be provided, with our offering of Canadian approved products we believe that we will be able to access at least a small percentage of the generic pharmaceuticals marketplace.
  
 As part of a subscription agreement, we have an obligation to pay a royalty of 5% of net sales on one of our generic products (Anastrozole) for a period of three (3) years from the date of the first sale of that product.
  
 While no assurances can be provided and subject to the availability of adequate financing, of which there is no assurance, we anticipate that profits from the sales of Generic Products will be used to finance our proprietary drug development program, including Adva-27a, our flagship anticancer compound. In addition to near-term revenue generation, building the generics business infrastructure and securing the proper permits will render us appropriately positioned for the marketing and distribution of our proprietary Adva-27a drug candidate, provided that Adva-27a is approved for such marketing and distribution, of which there can be no assurance.
  
  Proprietary Drug Development Operations
  
 Since inception, our proprietary drug development activities have been focused on the development of a small molecule called Adva-27a for the treatment of aggressive cancers. A Topoisomerase II inhibitor, Adva-27a has been shown to be effective at destroying Multidrug Resistant cancer cells including Pancreatic Cancer cells, Breast Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells and Uterine Sarcoma cells (Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012). Sunshine Biopharma is direct owner of all issued and pending worldwide patents pertaining to Adva-27a including U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935. See “Part I, Item 1 – Business - Intellectual Property.”
 Summary of Adva-27a Preclinical Studies
  
 Adva-27a is a GEM-difluorinated C-glycoside derivative of Podophyllotoxin. Another derivative of Podophyllotoxin called Etoposide is currently on the market and is used to treat various types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, testicular cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and several other forms of cancer. Etoposide is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs. Adva-27a and Etoposide are similar in that they both attack the same target in cancer cells, namely the DNA unwinding enzyme, Topoisomerase II. Unlike Etoposide, and other anti-tumor drugs currently in use, Adva-27a is able to destroy Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells. Adva-27a is the only compound known today that is capable of destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer. In addition, Adva-27a has been shown to have distinct and more desirable biological and pharmacological properties compared to Etoposide. In side-by-side studies using Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer cells and Etoposide as a reference, Adva-27a showed markedly improved cell killing activity (see Figure below). Our preclinical studies to date have shown that:
  
   ●
 Adva-27a is effective at killing different types of Multidrug Resistant cancer cells, including Pancreatic Cancer Cells (Panc-1), Breast Cancer Cells (MCF-7/MDR), Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells (H69AR), and Uterine Sarcoma Cells (MES-SA/Dx5).

 
   ●
 Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs.

   ●
 Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies and pharmacokinetics data in rats.

 
   ●
 Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates.

 
   ●
 Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase II with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar (this number has recently been reduce to 1.44 micromolar as a result of resolving the two isomeric forms of Adva-27a).

 
   ●
 Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats.

 
   ●
 Adva-27a does not inhibit tubulin assembly.

 
 These and other preclinical data have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, a peer-reviewed International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment. The publication which is entitled “Adva-27a, a Novel Podophyllotoxin Derivative Found to Be Effective Against Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells” [ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32: 4423-4432 (2012)] is available on our website at www.sunshinebiopharma.com.
  
 
 
 
  Clinical Development Path
  
 The early stage preclinical studies for our lead compound, Adva-27a, were successfully completed and the results have been published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH 32: 4423-4432 (2012). We have been delayed in our implementation of our clinical development program due to lack of funding. Our fund raising efforts are continuing and as soon as adequate financing is in place we will continue our clinical development program of Adva-27a by conducting the next sequence of steps comprised of the following:
  
   ●
 GMP Manufacturing of 2 kilogram for use in IND-Enabling Studies and Phase I Clinical Trials

   ●
 IND-Enabling Studies

   ●
 Regulatory Filing (Fast-Track Status Anticipated)

   ●
 Phase I Clinical Trials (Pancreatic Cancer and in parallel Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer)

  GMP Manufacturing
  
 On November 14, 2014, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza Ltd. and Lonza Sales Ltd. (hereinafter jointly referred to as “Lonza”), whereby we engaged Lonza to be the manufacturer of our Adva-27a anticancer drug. In June 2015 we received a sample of the pilot manufacturing run for evaluation. Our laboratory analyses showed that, while the sample meets all of the required chemical, physical and biological specifications, the amount of material generated (the “Yield”) by the pilot run was found to be significantly lower than anticipated. We are currently working towards finding possible solutions to increase the Yield and define a path forward. During the course of our discussions concerning the problem of the low Yield, Lonza informed us that they required us to pay them $687,818 prior to moving forward with any activity pertaining to the manufacturing agreement we have with them. We have repeatedly indicated to Lonza that a clear path defining exactly how the extremely low Yield issue would be addressed is imperative prior to us making any payments. As of the date of this report, neither party has changed its position. See “Part I, Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.”
 Clinical Trials
  
 Adva-27a’s initial indication will be pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer for which there are currently little or no treatment options available. We have concluded an agreement with McGill University’s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Canada to conduct Phase I clinical trials for these two indications. All aspects of the planned clinical trials in Canada will employ FDA standards at all levels. Subject to obtaining the necessary financing, we now anticipate that Phase I clinical trials will commence in mid-2018 and we estimate that it will take 18 months to complete, at which time we expect to receive limited marketing approval for “compassionate-use” under the FDA and similar guidelines in Canada. See “Potential Near-Term Opportunities” below.
 Potential Near-Term Opportunities
  
 According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 1.5 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year.  Given the terminal and limited treatment options available for the pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer indications we are planning to study, we anticipate being granted limited marketing approval (“compassionate-use”) for our Adva-27a following receipt of funding and a successful Phase I clinical trial.  There are no assurances that either will occur.  Such limited approval will allow us to make the drug available to various hospitals and health care centers for experimental therapy and/or “compassionate-use”, thereby generating some revenues in the near-term.
  
 We believe that upon successful completion of Phase I Clinical Trials we may receive one or more offers from large pharmaceutical companies to buyout or license our drug.  However, there are no assurances that our Phase I Trials will be successful, or if successful, that any pharmaceutical companies will make an acceptable offer to us.  In the event we do not consummate such a transaction, we will require significant capital in order to manufacture and market our new drug.

  Our Lead Anti-Cancer Compound, Adva-27a, in 3D
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 Effective October 8, 2015, we executed a Patent Purchase Agreement (the “October Purchase Agreement”), with Advanomics, a related party, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935 (the “US Patent”) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a.  On December 28, 2015, we executed a second Patent Purchase Agreement (the “December Purchase Agreement”), with Advanomics, pursuant to which we acquired all of the right, title and interest in and to all of the remaining worldwide rights covered by issued and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029 (the “Worldwide Patents”) for our anticancer compound, Adva-27a.
  
 Effective December 28, 2015, we entered into amendments (the “Amendments”) of these Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the total purchase price was reduced from $17,142,499 to $618,810, the book value of this intellectual property on the financial statements of Advanomics.  Further, the Amendments provided for automatic conversion of the promissory notes representing the new purchase price into an aggregate of 321,305,415 shares of our Common Stock once we increase our authorized capital such that these shares can be issued.  In July 2016 we increased our authorized capital and issued the 321,305,415 Common shares to Advanomics thereby completing all aspects of the patent purchase arrangements and securing direct ownership of all worldwide patents and rights pertaining to Adva-27a.
  
 In addition, in 2016 we signed Cross Referencing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four (4) prescription generic drugs for the treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. These agreements give us the right to register the four (4) generic products, Anastrozole, Letrozole, Bicalutamide and Finasteride in Canada under our own label and obtain a DIN for each in order to be able to place them on the market.
  
  Government Regulations
  
 Our business operations, including both the generic drugs operations and proprietary drug development operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations.
  
 In the U.S, the Federal Government agency responsible for regulating drugs is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Canadian counterpart to the FDA is the Health Products and Food Branch (“HPFB”) of Health Canada. Both the FDA and HPFB have similar requirements for a drug to be approved for marketing. In addition, the quality standards for brand name drugs and generic drugs are the same. The ingredients, manufacturing processes and facilities for all drugs must meet the guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). Moreover, all drug manufacturers must perform a series of tests, both during and after production, to show that every drug batch made meets the regulatory agency’s requirements for that product.

 In connection with our development of the new chemical entity, Adva-27a, we will be subject to significant regulations in the U.S. in order to obtain the approval of the FDA to offer our product on the market.  The approximate procedure for obtaining FDA approval involves an initial filing of an IND application following which the FDA would review the application and if all the data are in order and acceptable would give the go ahead for the drug sponsor to proceed with Phase I clinical (human) trials.  Following completion of Phase I, the results are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase II.  Similarly, following completion of Phase II the data are filed with the FDA and a request is made to proceed to Phase III.  Following completion of Phase III, a request is made for marketing approval.  Depending on various issues and considerations, the FDA could provide limited marketing approval on a humanitarian basis if the drug treats terminally ill patients with limited treatment options available.  As of the date of this Report we have not made any filings with the FDA or other regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions.  We have however had extensive discussions with clinicians at the McGill University’s Jewish General Hospital in Montreal where we plan to undertake our Phase I study for pancreatic cancer and multidrug resistant breast cancer they believe that Health Canada is likely to grant us a so-called fast-track process on the basis of the terminal nature of the cancer types which we will be treating.  There are no assurances this will occur.
  
  Employees
  
 As of the date of this Report we have three (3) employees, our management.  We anticipate that if we receive financing we will need additional employees in both our generic pharmaceutical and proprietary drug development operations including accounting, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales and laboratory personnel.
 Competition
  
 In the area of proprietary anticancer drug development, we will be competing with large publicly and privately held companies engaged in developing new cancer therapies. There are numerous other entities engaged in this business that have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.  Nearly all major pharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Roche, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis, to name just a few, have on-going anti-cancer drug development programs and some of the drug they may develop could be in direct competition with our drug.  Also, a number of small companies are also working in the area of cancer and could develop drugs that may be in competition with ours.  However, none of these competitor companies can use molecules similar to ours as they would be infringing our patents.
  
 The generic pharmaceuticals business is fairly competitive and there are many players in the field including several multinationals such as Teva (Israel), Novartis - Sandoz (Switzerland), Hospira (USA), Mylan (Netherlands), Sanofi (France), Fresenius Kabi (Germany) and Apotex (Canada)with annual sales in the range of approximately $2 billion to over $10. With our offering of Canadian approved generic products, we believe that we will be able to access at least a small percentage of the generic pharmaceuticals market.
  
  Trademarks-Tradenames
  
 We are the exclusive owner of all worldwide rights pertaining to Adva-27a covered by PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029.  The patent applications filed under PCT/FR2007/000697 have been issued in Europe, Canada, the United States (8,236,935) and elsewhere around the world.  The patent applications recently filed internationally under PCT/CA2014/000029 are still pending.
  
 We are the owner of Cross Referencing Agreements for four (4) generic drugs which we will market and sell under the tradenames SBI-Anastrozole, SBI-Letrozole, SBI-Bicalutamide and SBI-Finasteride.
