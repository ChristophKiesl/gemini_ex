Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11
 
On December 7, 2020, certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (the “Affiliate Debtors”) filed petitions for reorganization under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and, in connection therewith, filed the proposed Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Plan”). On February 2, 2021 (the “Emergence Date”), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied and we emerged from Chapter 11.
 
On the Emergence Date, we qualified for and adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic No. 852 – Reorganizations, which specifies the accounting and financial reporting requirements for entities reorganizing through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The application of fresh start accounting resulted in a new basis of accounting and we became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the implementation of the Plan and the application of fresh start accounting, our historical financial statements on or before the Emergence Date are not a reliable indicator of our results of operations for any period after our adoption of fresh start accounting.
 

As used herein, “Superior,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to (i) prior to the Emergence Date, SESI Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Superior Energy Services, Inc.) (“Predecessor”) and its subsidiaries and (ii) after the Emergence Date, Superior Energy Services, Inc. (formerly known as Superior Newco, Inc.) and its subsidiaries (“Successor”). Additionally, the use the following terms refer to our operations:
 

"Predecessor Period" | January 1, 2021 through February 2, 2021 
"Successor Period" | February 3, 2021 through December 31, 2021

Customers
 
Our customers are major and independent oil and gas companies that are active in the geographic areas in which we operate. There were no customers that exceeded 10% of our total revenues in 2022, 2021 or 2020. A reduction in sales to any of our existing large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.
Competition

We provide products and services worldwide in highly competitive markets, with competitors comprised of both small or regionally focused companies in our Rentals segment, and large or international companies in our Well services segment. Our revenues and earnings can be affected by several factors, including but not limited to changes in competition, fluctuations in drilling and completion activity, perceptions of future prices of oil and gas, government regulation, disruptions caused by factors such as weather, pandemics, and geopolitics, and general economic conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors are price, performance, product and service quality, safety, response time and breadth of products and services.
Potential Liabilities and Insurance

Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk and expose us to significant liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product sold by us, could result in personal injury, loss of life, and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as fire, explosion, well blowout or vessel loss, may result in substantial claims for damages.

As is customary in our industry, our contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers generally agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment or property, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir (including uncontained oil flow from a reservoir). Nonetheless, our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case.
 
We maintain a liability insurance program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability, property damage and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which we are liable, but well control costs are not covered by this program. These policies include primary and excess umbrella liability policies with limits of $200 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution incidents. All of the insurance policies we purchase contain specific terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions and are subject to either deductibles or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of insurance we maintain will be sufficient to fully protect us against all liabilities related to our business.
 
Government Regulation

Our business is significantly affected by federal, state and local laws and other regulations. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:
 •worker safety standards;
 •the protection of the environment;
 •the handling and transportation of hazardous materials; and
 •the mobilization of our equipment to, and operations conducted at, our work sites.
 
Numerous permits are required for the conduct of our business and operation of our various facilities and equipment, including our underground injection wells, trucks and other heavy equipment. These permits can be revoked, modified or renewed by issuing authorities based on factors both within and outside our control.
 

We cannot predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings in the future. We also cannot predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted, including changes in regulatory oversight, increase of federal, state or local taxes, increase of inspection costs, or the effect such changes may have on us, our businesses or our financial condition.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to extensive laws, regulations and treaties relating to air and water quality, generation, storage and handling of hazardous materials, and emission and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all regulations affecting our business. Historically, our expenditures in furtherance of our compliance with these laws, regulations and treaties have not been material, and we do not expect the cost of compliance to be material in the future.
 
Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue laws and regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before commencing operations, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our operations, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry and infrastructure industry in general. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
 
Climate Change

In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, collectively referred to as greenhouse gasses (“GHGs”). For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) includes billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration. These incentives could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for oil and gas and consequently adversely affect the business of our customers thereby reducing demand for our services. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge. Specifically, the IRA amends the Clean Air Act to impose a fee on the emission of methane that exceeds an applicable waste emissions threshold from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including sources in the offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025 and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA.
 
The EPA has also finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and almost half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Also, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and gas operations. While we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives.
 
At the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which went into effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with the 26th Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, the United

States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emission, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international commitments.

Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry by reducing demand for hydrocarbons and by making it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.

In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against certain energy companies and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
 
Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our productivity and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.

Raw Materials
 
We purchase various raw materials and component parts in connection with delivering our products and services. These materials are generally, but not always, available from multiple sources and may be subject to price volatility. While we generally do not experience significant long-term shortages of these materials, we have from time to time experienced temporary shortages of particular raw materials. We are always seeking ways to ensure the availability of resources, as well as manage costs of raw materials.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal weather and severe weather conditions can temporarily impair our operations and reduce demand for our products and services. Examples of seasonal events that negatively affect our operations include high seas associated with cold fronts during the winter months and hurricanes during the summer months in the Gulf of Mexico, and severe cold during winter months in the U.S. land market area.
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,200 employees. Our employees in Argentina are subject to union contracts which represents approximately 22.0% of our total employee base. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. We strive to employ a dynamic workforce to complement our core values. Our hiring policy forbids the discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race or religion. We are an inclusive company with people of various backgrounds, experience, culture, styles and talents. We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and we pride ourselves on workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews periodically and are included in the determination of their compensation and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a safety culture.
Facilities
 
We own or lease a large number of facilities in the U.S. and in various other countries throughout the world. Our international operations are primarily focused in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East/North Africa regions. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 9 properties classified as held for sale.
