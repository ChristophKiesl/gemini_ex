ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
History
 
Cosmos Group Holdings Inc.was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 14, 1987, under the name Shur De Cor, Inc. and engaged in developing certain mining claims. In April 1999, Shur De Cor merged with Interactive Marketing Technology, a New Jersey corporation that was engaged in the business of developing and direct marketing of consumer products. As the surviving company, Shur De Cor changed its name to Interactive Marketing Technology, Inc. Shur De Cor’s then management resigned and the management of Interactive New Jersey became the Company’s management. The prior management of Shur De Cor retained Shur De Cor’s business and assets. After that acquisition, the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, IMT’s Plumber, Inc., produced, marketed, and sold a licensed product called the Plumber’s Secret, which was discontinued in fiscal 2001. In May 2002, the Company ceased to actively pursue its product development and marketing business and actively sought to either acquire a third party, merge with a third party or pursue a joint venture with a third party in order to re-enter its former business of development and direct marketing of proprietary consumer products in the United States and worldwide.
 
On November 17, 2004, the Company acquired MPL, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement executed by the parties (the “2004 Agreement”). In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of 109,623,006 shares of its common stock to Imperial International Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Imperial”), the sole shareholder of MPL, in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPL capital stock (the “2004 Share Exchange”). Upon completion of the share exchange, MPL became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary and the Company’s former owner transferred control of the Company to Imperial. The Company relied on Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), in regard to the shares that the Company issued pursuant to the 2004 Share Exchange. The Company treated this transaction as a qualified “business combination” as defined by Rule 501(d). The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D promulgated under, the Act in issuing the Company’s securities.

On November 17, 2004, the Company acquired MPL, a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and its subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement executed by the parties (the “2004 Agreement”). In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of 109,623,006 shares of its common stock to Imperial International Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Imperial”), the sole shareholder of MPL, in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of MPL capital stock (the “2004 Share Exchange”). Upon completion of the share exchange, MPL became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary and the Company’s former owner transferred control of the Company to Imperial. The Company relied on Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), in regard to the shares that we issued pursuant to the 2004 Share Exchange. The Company treated this transaction as a qualified “business combination” as defined by Rule 501(d). The Company relied on the exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of, and Regulation D promulgated under, the Act in issuing the Company’s securities.
 
In connection with the 2004 Share Exchange, the Company: (i) changed its name from Interactive Marketing Technology, Inc. to China Artists Agency, Inc.; (ii) obtained a new stock symbol, “CAAY”, and CUSIP Number, effective on December 21, 2004; (iii) increased its authorized common stock to 200,000,000 shares; (iv) effectuated a 1 for 1.69 reverse stock split; and (v) spun off the Company’s existing business into a separate public company, All Star Marketing, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“All Star”). All Star was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Spin-off was satisfied by means of a pro-rata share dividend to the Company’s shareholders of record as of December 10, 2004. The purpose of the Spin-Off was to allow the subsidiary to operate as a separate public company and raise working capital through the sale of its own equity. This allowed the Company’s management to focus on its business, while at the same time, allowing the spun-off company to have greater exposure by trading as an independent public company. Additionally, the shareholders and the market would then more easily identify the results and performance of the Company as a separate entity from that of All Star. In August 2005, the Company changed its name to China Entertainment Group, Inc. and effective August 9, 2005, obtained a new stock symbol “CGRP”, and CUSIP Number.
 
Effective July 22, 2010, the Company merged with Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, the management of the Company resigned and was replaced by the management and principals of Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC. The holders of interests in Safe and Secure TV Channel, LLC exchanged their interests for approximately 50.2% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company. In September 2010, the Company effectuated a 9.85 for one stock split to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2010. After the Merger, the Company became a television network and multimedia information and distribution company focused on serving the homeland security and emergency preparedness industry.

NFT beneficially owns Talk+, a messaging and cryptocurrency-focused mobile application which seeks to simplify the crypto usage experience by allowing users to send crypto through instant messages to other individuals. The app provided users with the ability to access their own cryptocurrencies that were obtained independent of the Company by acting as a portal. However, the app did not allow for transfer of cryptocurrencies and all cryptocurrencies accessed by the end-user remains with the end-user, and are not transferred or held by the Company at any time. We hope that the inclusion of Talk+ will enable us to attract more non-crypto native users and broaden our community reach.

We believe that this acquisition will strengthen our DOT business by expanding our access to buyers of arts and collectibles. 
 
Other Activities
 
In March 2022, we launched a new sports division in our MetaMall and partnering with a former NBA basketball player as president of Coinllectible Sports. We hope to exploit our DOT technology and the metaverse to bring innovation to the sports space, bridge the intersection of our DOT technology and Sports memorabilia to improve experiences for fans, athletes, teams, events and partners.
Our Business
 
COSG is a Nevada holding company with operations conducted through our subsidiaries based in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in two business segments: (i) the physical arts and collectibles business, and (ii) the financing/money lending business. The Company currently does not have any customers that are from the United States or any U.S. person nor is the Company specifically targeting customers from the United States. However, the Company’s operation of an online market place for collectibles and fine art is accessible online by interested parties and may potentially be accessed by users located in the United States. 
 
The Company’s business focused on physical artworks and collectibles, while utilizing blockchain and NFT technologies to create a documents of title and a transparent ledger for each artwork or collectible to enhance the overall experience of each collector in order to facilitate sale transaction logistics. Through our physical arts and collectibles business, we provide authentication, valuation and certification (“AVC”) service, sale and purchase, hire purchase, financing, custody, security and exhibition (“CSE”) services to art and collectibles buyers through traditional methods as well as through leveraging blockchain technology through the creation of Digital Ownership Tokens (“DOTs”). We initially intend to focus on customers located in Hong Kong and expand throughout Asia and the rest of the world.
 
We conduct our DOT operations from Singapore. In Singapore, cryptocurrencies and the custodianship of such cryptocurrencies are not specifically regulated. Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading of cryptocurrencies are legal, but not considered legal tender. To the extent that cryptocurrencies or tokens are considered “capital market products” such as securities, spot foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and the like, they will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), Securities and Futures Act, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. To the extent that tokens are deemed “digital payment tokens,” they will be subject to the Payment Services Act of 2019 which, among other things, require compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. According to the Payment Services Act of 2019, “digital payment token” means any digital representation of value (other than an excluded digital representation of value) that (a) is expressed as a unit; (b) is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; (c) is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; (d) can be transferred, stored or traded electronically; and (e) satisfies such other characteristics as the Authority may prescribe. Our DOTs, therefore, are not securities or digital payment tokens subject to these acts.

We generally do not maintain custody of the DOTs or crypto assets. Where possible, we adopt a “sell then mint” process, where the DOTs are not minted unless they have been sold. This is in line with how legal documents are created where an Assignment is only drafted and signed after a sale of a property (e.g., scanned copies of an Assignment can be created in PDF form thereafter). The DOT merely a digital ownership title to a physical item. Subsequent to the transfer of Coinllectibles Limited, Coinllectibles (HK) Limited and Coinllectibles Wealth Limited to Dr. Lee pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Company and Dr. Lee dated December 15, 2022, the Company no longer minted any DOTs, and any DOTs sold by the Company as ownership documents in association with the underlying physical artwork or collectible are obtained from a third party.
 
Before the DOTs are sold, we store the underlying physical art pieces in our warehouse. We have purchased insurance that covers the art pieces stored in our warehouse. After the DOTs are sold, customers can choose to ship out the underlying art pieces or not. If customers want to ship out the art pieces, they will have to pay for the shipping and insurance fees.
 
The Company did not engage in the business of purchasing, holding or trading crypto currencies. We receive fiat and cryptocurrency from the sale of art and collectibles and collection of transaction fees derived from the secondary and subsequent sales of the collectibles. During  the financial period up to the transfer of Coinllectibles Limited, Coinllectibles (HK) Limited and Coinllectibles Wealth Limited to Dr. Lee pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Company and Dr. Lee dated December 15, 2022, the Company accepted crypto currencies such as ETH, BNB, USDT, BUSD, MATIC and OKT. In order to minimize the risk of price fluctuation in cryptocurrency, after we receive the cryptocurrencies we will recognize the value by immediately exchange them into US dollar or stable currencies that are pegged with US dollar. Subsequent to the Settlement Agreement dated December 15, 2022, the Company only accepted stable coins such as USDT, BUSD and MATIC. For crypto-payments, in compliance with our AML Policy, we have automatically blocked off transactions from all sanctioned jurisdictions. 
 
Meanwhile, the Company did not offer stablecoins to its customers as a product and its business remained focused on physical artworks and collectibles. The stablecoins were utilized to pay for the Company’s marketing and IT development expenses, including expenses associated with the minting process. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, crypto assets held by the Company was approximately 0.03% of its total assets. 
 
Where possible, we disposed the crypto assets as soon as we have received them. On the rare occasion that we do have custody of these assets, we keep them in an online multi-signatory wallet in the MultiSig system we developed so that they could be listed on our platform. When these DOTs are sold, the ownership of the DOTs is transferred to the buyer. The MultiSig system is developed internally by our Company for the purpose of holding DOTs in a multi-signatory wallet where multiple wallet holders , instead of a single wallet holder, are needed to approve any transaction. During the financial reporting period, there were only 6 wallet holders who had access to the multi-signatory wallet and at least 3 wallet holders’ approvals are required to process transactions. This reduced the risk of losing DOT from the loss or destruction of a single private key of the wallet, and the risk of DOT being stolen or destroyed by a single wallet holder.
 
The Company’s Talk+ messaging app was developed to assist end-users who were not familiar with cryptocurrencies. The app provided users with the ability to access their own cryptocurrencies that were obtained independent of the Company by acting as a portal. However, the app did not allow for transfer of cryptocurrencies and all cryptocurrencies accessed by the end-user remains with the end-user, and are not transferred or held by the Company at any time.
 
We conduct our financing/money lending business through our Hong Kong subsidiaries which are licensed under Hong Kong’s Money Lenders Ordinance. Our Hong Kong subsidiaries primarily provide unsecured personal loan financings to private individuals. We also have a small portfolio of mortgage loans. Revenue is generated from interest received from the provision of loans to private individual customers.
 
There may be prominent risks associated with our operations being in Hong Kong. We may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government including the risk that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which may result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions could change the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
 
As a U.S.-listed company with operations in Hong Kong, we may face heightened scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, which could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our common stock. It could also significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Additionally, changes in Chinese internal regulatory mandates, such as the M&A rules, Anti-Monopoly Law, and the soon to be effective Data Security Law, may target the Company’s corporate structure and impact our ability to conduct business in Hong Kong, accept foreign investments, or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Our Operations in Hong Kong” as herein.

COSG is a Nevada holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong and Singapore. This structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiaries and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Cosmos Group Holdings Inc. and its Hong Kong subsidiaries are not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), or Cybersecurity Administration Committee (“CAC”), to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. However, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we (the parent company and our subsidiaries) may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard including the risk that we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, or that the PRC government could disallow our holding company structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. These adverse actions would likely change the value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.”
 
We reported a net loss of $25,149,399 and net income of $467,725 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had current assets of $23,981,701 and current liabilities of $22,748,075 as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, our current assets and current liabilities were $14,721,331 and $15,271,366, respectively. The financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon improving our profitability and the continuing financial support from our stockholders.
 
On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with Williamsburg Venture Holdings, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Investor”), pursuant to which the Investor agreed to invest up to Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) over a 36-month period in accordance with the terms and conditions of that Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Equity Purchase Commitment”). 
 
Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions to our executive officers or existing shareholders, capital leases and short-term and long-term debts. We expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of these. While we believe that existing shareholders and our officers and directors will continue to provide the additional cash to make acquisitions and to meet our obligations as they become due or that we will obtain external financing, if necessary, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed below are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months.
 
We are organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.

Market Overview
 
According to The Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report 2021, the global arts market annual transactional volume is estimated to be $50.1 billion for 2020. According to Forbes, the global collectibles market reached $370 billion in 2016. Reuters reported that the collectible NFT market is approximately $13.7 million in the first half of 2020. Our DOT builds on top of the blockchain NFT technologies as the underlying technology infrastructure, even though we are still in the early stages in adoption of our DOTs, the trading volume of NFTs as reported by Reuters for the first half of 2021 has already reached approximately at $2.5 billion. Building on top of the blockchain NFT technologies, we believe DOTs have the potential to be as revolutionary and widely adopted as the internet. The unique properties of DOTs position them as a digital alternative to representing ownership of art and collectible pieces. We expect the DOT ecosystem to expand into the mainstream of art community around the world in the coming decades. The Company does not have any customers that are from the United States or any U.S. person nor is the Company specifically targeting customers from the United States. However, the Company’s operation of an online market place for collectibles and fine art is accessible online by interested parties and may potentially be accessed by users located in the United States.
Our Products and Services
 
A few of the challenges with collecting physical arts and collectibles are provenance of the piece, authenticity and valuation. The vision of Coinllectibles is to modernize the way we buy, collect and trade art and collectible pieces to provide a more pleasurable, transparent, and value enhancing experience for the collector and artist communities.
 
Coinllectibles intends to leverage blockchain technology to help resolve the issues of provenance, authenticity and ownership in the arts and collectibles market. We intend to embed into the blockchain for each art or collectible piece an independently apprised valuation, a 3D rendering of the piece, high-definition photo of the piece, AI recognition file of the piece and a set of legal documents to provide proof of ownership and provenance of the piece to the blockchain. Each piece will be minted into an individual DOT with the list of items embedded. The DOTs are intended to provide assurance on the authenticity of art or collectible pieces as well as act as a record of ownership transfers using blockchain technology to establish provenance of the piece. We believe this type of DOT would address some of the key challenges collectors presently face with arts and collectibles.
 
The metadata of an NFT allows very little information to be included. Generally, NFTs may contain a link to where an image is stored, while bundling terms and conditions governing the image, which are not incorporated in the NFT itself. During the financial period, the Company engaged an alternative approach of embedding  link points to a permanent web page on the blockchain which not only included the image but also all the terms and conditions governing the image or other asset. Everything on this permanent web page became part of the DOT.
 
With this method, not only the DOT is immutable by nature, the information pointed by the link in metadata of the DOT cannot be changed as well since it is also saved in a decentralized storage system. The cost involved include (1) drafting and preparing the legal documents for the ownership title, (2) the 3D scanning of the item which takes between 2-3 days to be scanned and rendered, (3) the taking of the high quality images for each of the item, (4) the training of the AI recognition file which takes between 3-5 days, (5) obtaining an valuation report from the independent appraiser, (6) creating a permanent web page and uploading the information onto the blockchain, and (7) minting the DOT onto the blockchain
 
We used NFT technology to create our DOTs so that we can enhance the way people collect artwork. Each piece will be minted into an individual DOT with the list of items embedded. During the financial period, our DOTs were minted on the Binance Smart Chain and the Polygon Chain. We chose these two blockchains based on the criteria of (i) fees, (ii) carbon footprint, and (iii) marketplaces. Binance Smart Chain has higher fees and carbon footprint than Polygon but caters to a different market segment, which is the market that is familiar with the Binance ecosystem. We used them when we needed to access the market segment that Binance Smart Chain targets and Polygon Chain does not target. Polygon Chain had lower fees and carbon footprint as compared to Binance Smart Chain and was accepted by many marketplaces. We minted approximately 0%and 0% of our DOTs on the Polygon Chain for the year ended December 31, 2021 and six months ended June 30, 2022. For the year ended Dec 31, 2022, we minted approximately 24% of our DOTs on the Polygon Chain. The DOT merely a digital ownership title to a physical item. Subsequent to the transfer of Coinllectibles Limited, Coinllectibles (HK) Limited and Coinllectibles Wealth Limited to Dr. Lee pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Company and Dr. Lee dated December 15, 2022, the Company no longer minted any DOTs, and any DOTs sold by the Company as ownership documents in association with the underlying physical artwork or collectible are obtained from a third party.

The DOTs are intended to provide assurance on the authenticity of art or collectible pieces as well as act as a record of ownership transfers using blockchain technology to establish provenance of the piece. We believe this type of DOT would address some of the key challenges collectors presently face with arts and collectibles. The DOTs were not sold as separate products but instead represented ownership title to the physical artwork on our platform in order to facilitate transaction logistics.
 
We generally do not maintain custody of the DOTs or crypto assets. Where possible, we adopt a “sell then mint” process, where the DOTs are not minted unless they have been sold. This is in line with how legal documents are created where an Assignment is only drafted and signed after a sale of a property (e.g., scanned copies of an Assignment can be created in PDF form thereafter). The DOT merely a digital ownership title to a physical item.
 
Before the DOTs are sold, we store the underlying physical art pieces in our warehouse. We have purchased insurance that covers the art pieces stored in our warehouse. After the DOTs are sold, customers can choose to ship out the underlying art pieces or not. If customers want to ship out the art pieces, they will have to pay for the shipping and insurance fees.
 
The Company did not engage in the business of purchasing, holding or trading crypto currencies. We receive fiat and cryptocurrency from the sale of art and collectibles and collection of transaction fees derived from the secondary and subsequent sales of the collectibles. During  the financial period up to the transfer of Coinllectibles Limited, Coinllectibles (HK) Limited and Coinllectibles Wealth Limited to Dr. Lee pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Company and Dr. Lee dated December 15, 2022, the Company accepted crypto currencies such as ETH, BNB, USDT, BUSD, MATIC and OKT. In order to minimize the risk of price fluctuation in cryptocurrency, after we receive the cryptocurrencies we will recognize the value by immediately exchange them into US dollar or stable currencies that are pegged with US dollar. Subsequent to the Settlement Agreement dated December 15, 2022, the Company only accepted stable coins such as USDT, BUSD and MATIC. For crypto-payments, in compliance with our AML Policy, we have automatically blocked off transactions from all sanctioned jurisdictions. 
 
Meanwhile, the Company did not offer stablecoins to its customers as a product and its business remained focused on physical artworks and collectibles. The stablecoins were utilized to pay for the Company’s marketing and IT development expenses, including expenses associated with the minting process. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, crypto assets held by the Company was approximately 0.03% of its total assets.
 
Where possible, we disposed the crypto assets as soon as we have received them. On the rare occasion that we do have custody of these assets, we keep them in an online multi-signatory wallet in the MultiSig system we developed so that they could be listed on our platform. When these DOTs are sold, the ownership of the DOTs is transferred to the buyer. The MultiSig system is developed internally by our Company for the purpose of holding DOTs in a multi-signatory wallet where multiple wallet holders , instead of a single wallet holder, are needed to approve any transaction. During the financial reporting period, there were only 6 wallet holders who had access to the multi-signatory wallet and at least 3 wallet holders’ approvals are required to process transactions. This reduced the risk of losing DOT from the loss or destruction of a single private key of the wallet, and the risk of DOT being stolen or destroyed by a single wallet holder.

We currently provide several services, including authentication, valuation and certification (“AVC”) service, sale and purchase, hire purchase, financing services, and custody, security and exhibition (“CSE”) services.
 
AVC Services
 
As part of our AVC services, we conduct authentication appraisal and valuation assessment of arts and collectibles through a panel of independent third-party appraisers. The appraisers will appraise the items and produce a certification showing whether the collectible piece is authentic with their estimated value. Once the item has been authenticated, it will undergo a scanning process to build a 3D model and a unique “fingerprint ID” for the item will be created through proprietary AI technology for future verification.
 
For Coinllectibles to be able to digitize the art and collectible pieces using blockchain technology, Coinllectibles first purchase the pieces from its current owner. Coinllectibles then charge the owner a fee for digitizing the pieces. Once the pieces are minted into DOTs, we work with our partner channels to distribute and sell the DOTs.
 
Hire Purchase Services; Financing
 
We can facilitate the purchase of arts and collectibles by offering certain of our buyers the option of taking possession of the arts and collectibles while paying on an installment basis through [*]. Prior to receipt of full payment, ownership of the arts and collectibles will remain with Coinllectibles. Once the buyer makes the last payment, the ownership of the arts and collectibles will transfer to the buyer once full payment has been received. During the financial period, no such transaction occurred, and the aggregate amount of installment loans amount outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2021 and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 is nil and nil, respectively. In the event that it did occur, the ownership of the artwork would have transferred upon purchase. We would take collateral over the artwork for the loan, in the form of a pledge, a charge, or a hypothecation, in the same way that the collateral is taken over other assets.
 
CSE Services
 
For collectors who have been purchasing our arts and collectibles and do not wish to take collection of the pieces, we intend to offer custodian services and have these arts and collectibles stored and safely secured until the collector elects to take possession. We also intend to allow the collectors to subscribe for additional security services for their art pieces be it when it is in our custody or when the item is on the move either to be delivered or collected from the collector. We will also introduce exhibition services to collectors and artist to organize exhibitions of artworks and collections in our gallery or other specialized art events.
 
A bailment contract (the “Contract”) is embedded into the metadata of our DOT (digital ownership token), which sets out the specific terms under which we hold the physical artwork on behalf of the owner of the DOT. As part of the bailment terms, given that ownership of the physical artwork has already been transferred to the DOT owner, the responsibility for obtaining insurance will be also be transferred to the DOT owner.
 
Coinllectibles intends to leverage blockchain technology to help resolve the issues of provenance, authenticity and ownership in the arts and collectibles market. We intend to embed into the blockchain for each art or collectible piece an independently apprised valuation, a 3D rendering of the piece, high-definition photo of the piece, AI recognition file of the piece and a set of legal documents to provide proof of ownership and provenance of the piece to the blockchain.

Because ownership of the artwork has been transferred at purchase, the owner has the responsibility to purchase their own insurance. We intend to offer services to display artworks at galleries and exhibitions. Depending on the bailment terms, we may need  approval from the owner and may have to share any income from such displays. The costs of exhibiting the artworks would include the insurance fee that covers the transportation, storage and exhibition of the artwork, the transportation fee for shipping the artwork, the storage fee for keeping the artworks in a secured location, and the rent of the venue 
 
Our Distribution Channels
 
Our subsidiary, Coinllectibles Private Limited have or expect to distribute and sell our DOTs through the following channels:
 

● | Traditional sales channels: Institutions and wealthy individuals who may be prospective art and collectibles purchasers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Auction houses such as Spink & Sons, that have an existing pool of prospective collectors. We will explore opportunities to collaborate with reputable auction houses, such as Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Macey & Son. 


● | Our metaverse platform (MetaMall) – coinllectibles.art allows collectors to efficiently buy and sell Fusion DOTs using fiat and cryptocurrency acting as an e-commerce platform. We recognize that there are distinct groups of crypto natives and non-crypto natives who share the same interest in acquiring collectibles. To make their experience more seamless and user-friendly, we work with various crypto exchanges to accept their currencies as payment for the Fusion DOTs collectibles. For crypto-payments, in compliance with our AML Policy, we have automatically blocked off transactions from all sanctioned jurisdictions. In addition, we have also set up a payment gateway which accepts credit / debit card payments for the same purpose.

Subsequent to the Settlement Agreement dated December 15, 2022, the Company only accepted stable coins such as USDT, BUSD and MATIC. Please also see “PRC Regulation Relating to Crypto Assets” on page 24 for more information.

We define the metaverse as the a multitude of universes which is comprising of our real physical world and multiple virtual environments and how an individual interacts between them. Hence, to us, we already live in the metaverse. We believe our DOT is a fundamental component of the metaverse, since it not only provides immutable and traceable records through the use of blockchain technology, but it also contains legal documents to protect the rights of its owner. Our MetaMall is an e-commerce platform that is a part of the metaverse. Asset owners can list their assets in the form of DOTs while buyers can make the purchase. MetaMall provides a platform for users to trade their assets with an immutable track record in the metaverse.
 
We will continue to enhance over time the shopping experience on our e-commerce platform through 3D, AR, VR and other technologies available to us from time to time. 
 
We use a wide range of social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram and held Ask Me Anything sessions through social media channels to reach out to the general community to announce our art exhibitions, the DOTs attached to the pieces and news about our partnerships with artists. Coinllectibles will also participate in arts and collectibles events and exhibitions to promote us as a firm and the DOTs that we will be launching.

Pricing determination
 
Pricing of our products and services is based on our operating costs, volume of product / service, fees charged by strategic partners and suppliers, market condition and competition. Our subsidiaries, Grand Town Limited and Coinllectibles Private Limited also participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with our joint venture partners in which we have pre-set mechanism. Based on the above factors and conditions, we may evaluate and adjust our pricing from time to time.
 
In light of the competitive nature over the market and industry, we believe that our success will depend upon the reliability and quality of products & services provided and cost management. In general, we strive to maintain top class of high-quality products and services as well as to meet customers’ satisfaction. We are dedicated to establishing systems and operating procedures to achieve service standardization and quality control over the products and services provided by Coinllectibles. We expect to continuously monitor and seek to improve on a series of key service quality indicators (“KPI”) to maintain a competitive advantage in the market and industry.
 
Our Business Plan
 
On October 22, 2021, Massive Treasure, a subsidiary of Cosmos Group Holdings Inc., acquired 51% of NFT Limited (“NFT”) through the issuance of 2,350,229 shares of common stock of the Company. NFT beneficially owns Talk+, a messaging and cryptocurrency-focused mobile application which seeks to simplify the crypto usage experience by allowing users to send crypto through instant messages to other individuals. The app provided users with the ability to access their own cryptocurrencies that were obtained independent of the Company by acting as a portal. However, the app did not allow for transfer of cryptocurrencies and all cryptocurrencies accessed by the end-user remains with the end-user, and are not transferred or held by the Company at any time. We hope that the inclusion of Talk+ will enable us to attract more non-crypto native users and broaden our community reach. 
 
In late December 2021, Coinllectibles Private Limited, launched our metaverse platform (“MetaMall”), which we believe is an important step to further engage with our growing community of collectors and partners. Our MetaMall will feature pieces from an increasing range of artists and sportsmen. We hope to bring more limited-edition collectibles to more people through MetaMall. We define the metaverse as a multitude of universes which is comprising of our real physical world and multiple virtual environments and how an individual interacts between them. Hence, to us, we already live in the metaverse. We believe our DOT is a fundamental component of the metaverse, since it not only provides immutable and traceable records through the use of blockchain technology, but it also contains legal documents to protect the rights of its owner. Our MetaMall is an e-commerce platform that is a part of the metaverse. Asset owners can list their assets in the form of DOTs while buyers can make the purchase. MetaMall provides a platform for users to trade their assets with an immutable track record in the metaverse. We will continue to enhance over time the shopping experience on our e-commerce platform through 3D, AR, VR and other technologies available to us from time to time.
 
We believe that our DOTs will bridge the virtual and physical world in art and collectible ownership and enjoyment. Our DOT is a virtual token that represents the ownership of an asset and is the foundation of Coinllectibles™️ metaverse that Coinllectibles™️ defines as a multiverse where the real world interacts seamlessly with the emerging virtual dimensions.
 
In late January 2022, Coinllectibles Private Limited partnered with Spink & Sons, an art auction house, on its inaugural DOT offering, where we created a hybrid- DOT to a physical collectible piece.  We intend to pursue additional similar partnership opportunities in the future.
 
On February 10, 2022, Coinllectibles Private Limited consummated the acquisition of 80% of the issued and outstanding securities of Grand Gallery Limited, a Hong Kong limited liability company engaged in the business of selling traditional art and collectible pieces, through the issuance of 153,060 shares of our common stock, at a valuation of $4.00 per share. We believe that this acquisition will strengthen our DOT business by expanding our access to buyers of arts and collectibles. 
 
In March 2022, we launch a new sports division in our MetaMall and partnering with a former NBA basketball player as president of Coinllectibles Sports. We hope to exploit our DOT technology and the metaverse to bring innovation to the sports space, bridge the intersection of our DOT technology and sports memorabilia to improve experiences for fans, athletes, teams, events and partners.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 
We expect to rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our “Digital Ownership Token” and Coinllectibles brands and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
The laws of Singapore, Hong Kong and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending on the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. In certain countries, intellectual property protection may be more limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection for our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend to protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

COMPETITION
 
We operate in a highly specialized area that is evolving very quickly with rapid developments. Currently there is no direct competitors in the market as we operate in a niche and specialized area of the market. However, we foresee that our eventual competitors would be leading arts and collectible sellers such as Christie’s and Sotheby’s which may offer substantially the same or similar service offerings as us. Auction houses have a well-established customer base and brand name, but they have not developed sophisticated technology to transform their business into the blockchain NFT technology area. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

● | breadth of artist and collectibles base; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sophistication of proprietary technologies; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | excellence in legal expertise; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strength and recognition of our brand. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Although we believe we compete favorably on the factors described above, we anticipate that larger, more established companies may directly compete with us as we continue to demonstrate the viability of our DOT solution. Many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, larger product and services offerings, larger customer base and greater brand recognition. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger customer base or to monetize that customer base more effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that merchant payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our market, they may become such a factor and we may be unable to compete fairly on such terms.

United States of America
 
Regulation of Cryptocurrency and Government Oversight
 
As digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS and state financial institution regulators) have been examining the operations of digital assets networks, digital assets users and the digital assets exchange markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges or other service-providers that hold digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of digital assets transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in digital assets activity.
 
Various foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Bitcoin network, the digital assets markets, and their users, particularly digital assets exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. For example, on May 21, 2021, minutes of the meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China were published, at which, as part of an effort to prevent and control financial risks, restrictions on digital assets mining and trading activity were discussed. On May 18, 2021, certain influential trade bodies, including the China Banking Association, the Payment and Clearing Association of China, and the National internet Finance Association of China, issued a statement instructing their members not to provide virtual currency-related trading or payments services, or the exchange of virtual currencies for China’s renminbi, among others, to their customers. In 2017, the People’s Bank of China and other Chinese financial regulators issued an announcement prohibiting token issuances such as initial coin offerings, and imposing restrictions on virtual currency exchange platforms and financial institutions and non-bank payment institutions in connection with token-related activity. There have been reports over the years that Chinese regulators have taken action to shut down a number of China-based virtual currency exchanges. On March 5, 2020, South Korea voted to amend its Financial Information Act to require virtual asset service providers to register and comply with its AML and counter-terrorism funding framework. These measures also provide the South Korean government with the authority to close virtual currency exchanges that do not comply with specified processes. The South Korean government previously banned initial coin offerings. Similarly, in April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned the entities it regulates from providing services to any individuals or business entities dealing with or settling digital assets. On March 5, 2020, this ban was overturned in the Indian Supreme Court, although the Reserve Bank of India has challenged this ruling. The laws, regulations or directives of authorities in jurisdictions worldwide may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of or demand for digital assets by users, merchants and service providers, may impede the growth or continued operation of the global digital assets economy or digital assets mining, or may otherwise negatively affect the value of digital assets.
 
While we believe that our DOT’s is currently not a security or commodity subject to many of the U.S. laws and regulations governing securities and commodities, the legal environment is constantly changing as new laws and regulations are introduced and adopted, and existing laws and regulations are repealed, amended, modified and reinterpreted. The effect of any future regulatory change on Cosmos Group Holdings Inc., our operating subsidiaries or our digital assets such as our DOTs is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adversely impact current product offerings or alter the economic performance of our existing products and services resulting in a decline in the value of our securities.

Privacy and Protection of User Data
 
We and subsidiaries are subject to a number of laws, rules, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in the countries where we operate. Our business will involve the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. As a result, much of the personal data that we process, which may include certain financial information associated with individuals, is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and, in some cases, the privacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiaries, and other parties with which we have commercial relationships. 
Singapore
 
Regulations on Cryptocurrency
 
We intend to conduct our DOT operations from Singapore. In Singapore, cryptocurrencies and the custodianship of such cryptocurrencies are not specifically regulated. Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading of cryptocurrencies are legal, but not considered legal tender. To the extent that cryptocurrencies or tokens are considered “capital market products” such as securities, spot foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and the likes, they will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), Securities and Futures Act, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. To the extent that tokens are deemed “digital payment tokens,” they will be subject to the Payment Services Act of 2019 which, among other things, require compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism laws and requirements. According to the Payment Services Act of 2019, “digital payment token” means any digital representation of value (other than an excluded digital representation of value) that

(a) | is expressed as a unit; 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; 
(c) | is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; 
(d) | can be transferred, stored or traded electronically; and 
(e) | satisfies such other characteristics as the Authority may prescribe; 

 
We believe our DOT’s are not securities or digital payment tokens subject to these acts.
 
Employment Ordinance
 
Hong Kong
 
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.
 
An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are HKD$7,100 and HKD$30,000 respectively.

China
 
Depending upon the political climate, we may also become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to COSG.
 
PRC Regulations on Tax
 
Enterprise Income Tax
 
The EIT Law was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008, and was later amended on February 24, 2017. The Implementation Rules of the EIT Law (the “Implementation Rules”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 6, 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008. According to the EIT Law and the Implementation Rules, enterprises are divided into resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. Resident enterprises shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises setting up institutions in the PRC shall pay enterprise income tax on the incomes obtained by such institutions in and outside the PRC at the rate of 25%. Non-resident enterprises with no institutions in the PRC, and non-resident enterprises whose incomes having no substantial connection with their institutions in the PRC, shall pay enterprise income tax on their incomes obtained in the PRC at a reduced rate of 10%.
 
The Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the “Arrangement”) was promulgated by the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on August 21, 2006 and came into effect on December 8, 2006. According to the Arrangement, a company incorporated in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at the lower rate of 5% on dividends it receives from a company incorporated in the PRC if it holds a 25% interest or more in the PRC company. The Notice on the Understanding and Identification of the Beneficial Owners in the Tax Treaty (the “Notice”) was promulgated by SAT and became effective on October 27, 2009. According to the Notice, a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a substance-over-form principle to determine whether or not to grant tax treaty benefits.
 
In April 2009, the Ministry of Finance, or MOF, and SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. In December 2009, SAT issued the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 2008. In February 2011, SAT issued the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 24, effective April 2011. By promulgating and implementing these circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise.
 
Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the equity interests of a PRC “resident enterprise” indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.
 
19

 

In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.
 
On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued a Notice Concerning Withholding Income Tax of Non-Resident Enterprise, or SAT Notice No. 37, which abolishes Circular 698 and certain provisions of Circular 7. SAT Notice No. 37 reduces the burden of the withholding obligator, such as revocation of contract filing requirements and tax liquidation procedures, strengthens the cooperation of tax authorities in different places, and clarifies the calculation of tax payable and mechanism of foreign exchange.
 
Value-added Tax
 
Pursuant to the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, or the VAT Regulations, which were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, took effect on January 1, 1994, and were amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016, and November 19, 2017, respectively, and the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value-added Tax of the PRC, which were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were amended on December 15, 2008, and October 28, 2011, respectively, entities and individuals that sell goods or labor services of processing, repair or replacement, sell services, intangible assets, or immovables, or import goods within the territory of the People’s Republic of China are taxpayers of value-added tax. The VAT rate is 17% for taxpayers selling goods, labor services, or tangible movable property leasing services or importing goods, except otherwise specified; 11% for taxpayers selling services of transportation, postal, basic telecommunications, construction and lease of immovable, selling immovable, transferring land use rights, selling and importing other specified goods including fertilizers; 6% for taxpayers selling services or intangible assets.
 
According to the Notice on the Adjustment to the Value-added Tax Rates issued by the SAT and the MOF on April 4, 2018, where taxpayers make VAT taxable sales or import goods, the applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 17% to 16% and from 11% to 10%, respectively. Subsequently, the Notice on Policies for Deepening Reform of Value-added Tax was issued by the SAT, the MOF and the General Administration of Customs on March 30, 2019 and took effective on April 1, 2019, which further adjusted the applicable tax rate for taxpayers making VAT taxable sales or importing goods. The applicable tax rates shall be adjusted from 16% to 13% and from 10% to 9%, respectively.
 
Dividend Withholding Tax
 
The EIT Law provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors that do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or that have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.

PRC Laws and Regulations on Employment and Social Welfare
 
Labor Law of the PRC
 
Pursuant to the Labor Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on July 5, 1994 with an effective date of January 1, 1995 and was last amended on August 27, 2009 and the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated on June 29, 2007, became effective on January 1, 2008 and was last amended on December 28, 2012, with the amendments coming into effect on July 1, 2013, enterprises and institutions shall ensure the safety and hygiene of a workplace, strictly comply with applicable rules and standards on workplace safety and hygiene in China, and educate employees on such rules and standards. Furthermore, employers and employees shall enter into written employment contracts to establish their employment relationships. Employers are required to inform their employees about their job responsibilities, working conditions, occupational hazards, remuneration and other matters with which the employees may be concerned. Employers shall pay remuneration to employees on time and in full accordance with the commitments set forth in their employment contracts and with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. Our Hong Kong subsidiary currently does not comply with PRC laws and regulations, but complies with Hong Kong laws and regulations.
 
Social Insurance and Housing Fund
 
Pursuant to the Social Insurance Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC on October 28, 2010 and became effective on July 1, 2011, employers in the PRC shall provide their employees with welfare schemes covering basic pension insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and occupational injury insurance. Our Hong Kong subsidiary has not deposited the social insurance fees in full for all the employees in compliance with the relevant regulations. We may be ordered by the social security premium collection agency to make or supplement contributions within a stipulated period, and shall be subject to a late payment fine computed from the due date at the rate of 0.05% per day; where payment is not made within the stipulated period, the relevant administrative authorities shall impose a fine ranging from one to three times the amount of the amount in arrears. Our Hong Kong subsidiary has not deposited the social insurance fees as required by relevant regulations.
 
In accordance with the Regulations on Management of Housing Provident Fund, which were promulgated by the State Council on April 3, 1999 and last amended on March 24, 2002, employers must register at the designated administrative centers and open bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. Employers and employees are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time. Our subsidiaries have not registered at the designated administrative centers nor opened bank accounts for depositing employees’ housing funds. They also have not deposited employees’ housing funds. Our subsidiaries may be ordered by the housing provident fund management center to complete the registration formalities, open bank accounts, make the payment and deposit within a prescribed time limit if they become subject to PRC laws. Failing to register or open bank accounts at the expiration of the time limit could result in fines of not less than RMB10,000 nor more than RMB50,000. And an application may be made to a people’s court for compulsory enforcement if payment and deposit has not been made after the expiration of the time limit.

PRC Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange
 
General Administration of Foreign Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in the PRC is the Administrative Regulations of the PRC on Foreign Exchange (the “Foreign Exchange Regulations”), which were promulgated on January 29, 1996, became effective on April 1, 1996 and were last amended on August 5, 2008. Under these rules, RMB is generally freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions and dividend payments, but not freely convertible for capital account items, such as capital transfer, direct investment, investment in securities, derivative products or loans unless prior approval by competent authorities for the administration of foreign exchange is obtained. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of SAFE to pay dividends by providing certain evidentiary documents, including board resolutions, tax certificates, or for trade- and services-related foreign exchange transactions, by providing commercial documents evidencing such transactions.
Circular No. 37 and Circular No. 13
 
Circular 37 was released by SAFE on July 4, 2014 and abolished Circular 75 which had been in effect since November 1, 2005. Pursuant to Circular 37, a PRC resident should apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of overseas investments before it makes any capital contribution to a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests. SPVs are offshore enterprises directly established or indirectly controlled by domestic residents for the purpose of investment and financing by utilizing domestic or offshore assets or interests they legally hold. Following any significant change in a registered offshore SPV, such as capital increase, reduction, equity transfer or swap, consolidation or division involving domestic resident individuals, the domestic individuals shall amend the registration with SAFE. Where an SPV intends to repatriate funds raised after completion of offshore financing to the PRC, it shall comply with relevant PRC regulations on foreign investment and foreign debt management. A foreign-invested enterprise established through return investment shall complete relevant foreign exchange registration formalities in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange administration regulations on foreign direct investment and truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of its shareholders.
 
If any shareholder who is a PRC resident (as determined by the Circular No. 37) holds any interest in an offshore SPV and fails to fulfil the required foreign exchange registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries of that offshore SPV may be prohibited from distributing their profits and dividends to their offshore parent company or from carrying out other subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities. The offshore SPV may also be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Where a domestic resident fails to complete relevant foreign exchange registration as required, fails to truthfully disclose information on the actual controller of the enterprise involved in the return investment or otherwise makes false statements, the foreign exchange control authority may order them to take remedial actions, issue a warning, and impose a fine of less than RMB 300,000 on an institution or less than RMB 50,000 on an individual.
 
Circular 13 was issued by SAFE on February 13, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to Circular 13, a domestic resident who makes a capital contribution to an SPV using his or her legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests is no longer required to apply to SAFE for foreign exchange registration of his or her overseas investments. Instead, he or she shall register with a bank in the place where the assets or interests of the domestic enterprise in which he or she has interests are located if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate domestic assets or interests; or he or she shall register with a local bank at his or her permanent residence if the domestic resident individually seeks to make a capital contribution to the SPV using his or her legitimate offshore assets or interests.
 
We cannot assure that our PRC beneficial shareholders have completed registrations in accordance with Circular 37.
 
22

 

Circular 19 and Circular 16
 
Circular 19 was promulgated by SAFE on March 30, 2015, and became effective on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises, meaning the monetary contribution confirmed by the foreign exchange authorities or the monetary contribution registered for account entry through banks, shall be granted the benefits of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement (“Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement”). With Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement, foreign capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution have been confirmed by the local foreign exchange bureau, or for which book-entry registration of monetary contribution has been completed by the bank, can be settled at the bank based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The allowed Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement percentage of the foreign capital of a foreign-invested enterprise has been temporarily set to be 100%. The Renminbi converted from the foreign capital will be kept in a designated account and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to make any further payment from such account, it will still need to provide supporting documents and to complete the review process with its bank.
 
Furthermore, Circular 19 stipulates that foreign-invested enterprises shall make bona fide use of their capital for their own needs within their business scopes. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and the Renminbi it obtained from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for the following purposes:
 

● | directly or indirectly used for expenses beyond its business scope or prohibited by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for investment in securities unless otherwise provided by relevant laws or regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for entrusted loan in Renminbi (unless within its permitted scope of business), repayment of inter-company loans (including advances by a third party) or repayment of bank loans in Renminbi that have been sub-lent to a third party; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directly or indirectly used for expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use (except for foreign-invested real estate enterprises). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Circular 16 was issued by SAFE on June 9, 2016. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on a self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange capital items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis applicable to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that an enterprise’s Renminbi capital converted from foreign currency-denominated capital may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or purposes prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, and such converted Renminbi capital shall not be provided as loans to non-affiliated entities.
 
Our PRC subsidiaries’ distributions to their offshore parents are required to comply with the requirements as described above.
 
PRC Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.

PRC Regulation of Dividend Distributions
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Chinese-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations, and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
 
PRC Regulation Relating to Crypto Assets
 
Since 2013, the Chinese government has issued several regulations and statements aimed at regulating cryptocurrencies. These regulations include cracking down on illegal activities related to cryptocurrencies and strengthening the regulation of financial activities related to virtual currencies in mainland China, hence, the company does not do business in mainland China.
 
In December 03, 2013, the People’s Bank of China and four other departments jointly issued the “Notice on Guarding Against Bitcoin Risks, (the “Notice on Guarding Against Bitcoin Risks”) which became effective on the same day. The Notice on Guarding Against Bitcoin Risks clarified that Bitcoin is a virtual commodity rather than legal tender and established a legal boundary for financial and payment institutions conducting Bitcoin-related business.
 
In September 04, 2017, the People’s Bank of China and six other departments jointly issued the “Announcement on Preventing Token Fundraising Risks”(the “Announcement on Preventing Token Fundraising Risks”) ,which became on effective same day. The Announcement on Preventing Token Fundraising Risks declares initial coin offerings (ICOs) to be unauthorized and illegal fundraising activities. Token trading platforms are prohibited from providing pricing, information agency or other services for tokens or “virtual currencies.”
 
In September 15, 2021, the People’s Bank of China and nine other ministries and commissions issued the “Notice on Further Preventing and Dealing with Speculation Risks in Virtual Currency Trading,” (the “Notice”), which came into effect on the same day. The Notice states that virtual currencies do not have the same legal status as legal tender and that the business activities related to virtual currencies are illegal financial activities in mainland China. The Notice also highlighted the legal risks of participating in virtual currency investment and trading activities, stating that investments that go against public order and good morals are null and void, and losses incurred are to be borne by the concerned legal person, unincorporated organization, or natural person.
 
In April 13, 2022, the National Internet Finance Association of China, China Banking Association, and Securities Association of China jointly issued the “Initiative on Preventing the Financial Risks Concerning NFT” (the “Initiative”), which came into effect on the same day. The Initiative recognizes the digital creative work attribute of NFT products and their potential value in enriching the digital economy model and promoting the development of the cultural and creative industries. The Initiative also clarifies that transactions involving NFT products are protected and recognized while protecting consumer rights and promoting rational consumption. The Initiative strictly prohibits the financialization and securitization of NFT and does not allow the use of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, or other virtual currencies as valuation and settlement tools for the issuance and trading of NFT. While the Initiative does not have the force of law, the initiators of the Initiative are competent authorities of the industry, reflecting regulatory attitudes and legislative trends to some extent.

Subject to the laws and regulations of the PRC, individuals in China are not prohibited from purchasing NFTs and physical artworks by using payment methods such as cash, credit cards and other payment methods accepted by overseas NFT exchanges or physical artwork sellers, excluding virtual currencies. Relevant laws and regulations in PRC include the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations of the PRC, the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange and the Implementation Regulations for the Administrative Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange (the “Implementing Regulations”).
 
Under the Implementing Regulations, the sale of foreign currency by individuals and the purchase of foreign currency domestically are subject to annual quota management, with an annual quota of US$50,000 per person. Transactions in excess of this annual quota require valid identification and documentary evidence to be processed through a bank. In addition, the “Application Form for Individual Purchase of Foreign Exchange” attached to the “Notice by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Facilitation of Individual Foreign Exchange Business Under The Current Account” stipulates that foreign exchange obtained through individual purchase and sale shall not be used for capital items that are not permitted and shall not be used to investment in securities, purchase of life insurance, investment of return on with-profits insurance, purchase of overseas houses, etc. It is also forbidden to engage in illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling, tax evasion or the underground movement of money.
 
According to the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on the Management of Foreign Currency Bank Cards, which was issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and came into effective November 01,2010, the overseas merchants that can be purchased with domestic bank cards include three categories of completely prohibited, limited in amount, and completely open. The completely prohibited merchants are prohibited to make transactions by the cardholders. For the limited in amount merchants, a single payment payable by the cardholder is limited to US$5,000 or less, with the exception of Financial Institutions – Over-the-Counter Services and Financial Services – ATM Services. There is no limit on payments made to the completely open merchants, including shopping, dining, accommodation, transportation, communication, medical care and education and other normal consumer payments. Commercial photography, art, and graphics are included in the “Limited in Amount” category and art dealers and galleries are included in the “completely Open” category, referring to the Annex I: Merchant Category Codes for the Use of Domestic Bank Cards outside China. Moreover, it should be noted that the State Administration of Foreign Exchange has implemented the Notice on Reporting Information, which requires all domestic financial institutions that issue bank cards, such as debit cards and credit cards, to report to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange any single consumption transaction of RMB 1,000 or more (excluding) that takes place at physical or online merchants outside the PRC, effective from 1 September 2017.
 
In light of the above, Chinese nationals are restricted from trading crypto in the PRC. This restriction applies to all online transactions around the world. However, the PRC supports the responsible implementation of NFT and blockchain technology to real world applications, and Management strongly believes the Company’s DOTs are one of such real-world applications.
 
It should also be noted that the restrictions above do not apply offshore, and the Company’s customer base has not been focused on PRC customers. In the rare occasion that we have such a customer, Metamall allows for payment via credit cards. The Company believes any such aforementioned restrictions will not impact our sales the Company’s sales.

ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
 
COSG is organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as a holding company that conducts its business through number of subsidiaries organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions such as Singapore, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands. This may have an adverse impact on the ability of U.S. investors to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts against these entities, or to effect service of process on the officers and directors managing the foreign subsidiaries.
 
A substantial portion of our assets are located in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, our current directors and officers are Hong Kong / Australian / New Zealand residents with substantial portions of their assets located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons, or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or them, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. It will also be costlier and time-consuming for the investors to effect service of process outside the United States, or to enforce judgments obtained from the U.S. courts in the courts of the jurisdictions where our directors and officers reside. For example, to enforce a foreign judgment in Hong Kong, you will be required to apply to the Hong Kong High Court to enforce a foreign judgment (the “Application”) for which you will be required to engage a local counsel to facilitate or prepare the Application alongside the various supporting documentations for the Application. After which, you will be required to go through the standard litigation process to sue on the judgment as a debt. In addition, a judgment of a United States court for civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States may also not be enforceable in or recognized by the courts of the jurisdictions where our directors and officers reside. As such, you may encounter difficulties to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors. 
 Further, insofar as PRC factor may be concerned, there is uncertainty as to whether the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) courts would (i) entertain original actions brought in the PRC against us or our directors or officers based on the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States or (ii) recognize or enforce judgments of the courts of the United States obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. To this end, we note that none of our directors or officers are Chinese nationals nor does the company hold any assets and/or host any operations within the PRC. PRC courts may therefore come to the view there is no locus.
 Under the “one country, two systems” principle, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has an independent judiciary that operates separately from the courts in mainland China. The courts of Hong Kong have jurisdiction over all cases that arise within its territory, including civil and criminal cases, as well as cases related to the interpretation of the Basic Law.
 Where PRC law does apply however, in order to enforce a foreign judgment in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC, certain criteria must be met as stipulated by the PRC Civil Procedure Law and other related laws and regulations. These criteria include, but are not limited to: (i) the judgment being sought for recognition must be a final and valid judgment or decree issued by a foreign court; (ii) the court that rendered the judgment or decree must have jurisdiction over the case under the applicable foreign law; (iii) the proceedings of the foreign court must have been fair and lawful under the applicable foreign law, including effective service on the defendant and giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard; (iv) there must be no conflicting interests in the case; (v) the requested court must not be conducting an ongoing trial between the same parties on the same subject matter or have already rendered an effective judgment, nor must it have recognized a judgment rendered by a third country in the case; (vi) there must be a treaty relationship or reciprocity between the two countries for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters; and (vii) the recognition and enforcement of the judgment must not violate the fundamental principles of the laws of the PRC or the sovereignty, security, or public interests of the PRC.
 As of the date of this Report, there are no existing treaties or written arrangements between the PRC and the United States for the mutual recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. Furthermore, under the PRC Civil Procedure Law, a foreign judgment against us, our directors, or officers cannot be enforced by PRC courts if the court finds that it violates the fundamental principles of PRC laws or national sovereignty, security, or public interests. This raises uncertainty about whether and under what circumstances a PRC court would enforce a judgment issued by a court in the United States or the Cayman Islands. In addition, due to our incorporation under the laws of the Cayman Islands, it would be difficult for U.S. shareholders to bring a lawsuit against us in China under PRC laws. The PRC Civil Procedure Law and related laws and regulations require a connection to the PRC to establish jurisdiction, which may be challenging for U.S. shareholders to establish based solely on their ownership of our shares.
 
See the Risk Factor- “It may be difficult for stockholders to enforce any judgment obtained in the United States against us, which may limit the remedies otherwise available to our stockholders” on page 40 for more information.
