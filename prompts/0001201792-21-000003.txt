ITEM 1. BUSINESS
American Public Education, Inc., or APEI, provides online and on-campus postsecondary education to approximately 92,500 students through two subsidiary institutions. In this Annual Report, “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and similar terms refer to APEI and its educational institutions of higher learning collectively unless the context indicates otherwise.
This Item 1 of our Annual Report contains a “Company Overview” section that provides information about our reporting segments, the postsecondary educational market and opportunities, competition, our competitive strengths, our strategic approach, seasonality, and available information about us. This Item 1 also contains a section entitled “Our Institutions” that provides institution specific information regarding each of our two subsidiary institutions, our information technology, and our executive officers, and a section entitled “Regulatory Environment” that provides information on some of the educational and other regulations that impact us.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
We seek to maximize a student’s return on their educational investment, which we call Higher Ed Return on Investment or “HEROITM”. Our institutions of higher learning offer programs designed to prepare individuals for productive contributions to their profession and society and to offer opportunities that may advance students in their current professions or help them prepare for their next career. Our institutions are:
•American Public University System, Inc., or APUS, which provides online postsecondary education to approximately 90,400 adult learners. APUS is an accredited university system with a history of serving the academic needs of the military, military-affiliated, public service and service-minded communities through two brands: American Military University, or AMU; and American Public University, or APU.
APUS offers 129 degree programs and 112 certificate programs in diverse fields of study, with a particular focus on those relevant to today’s job market and emerging fields. Fields of study include traditional academics, such as business administration, health science, technology, criminal justice, education, and liberal arts, as well as public service-focused fields of study such as national security, military studies, intelligence, and homeland security. APUS has institutional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, and several of its academic programs have specialized accreditations granted by industry governing organizations.
APUS is committed to providing quality, relevant, accessible, affordable, and student-focused higher education to a diverse student population in order to prepare students for service and leadership in a diverse, global society. In addition, the institution seeks to provide professional and workforce development solutions through partnerships with corporations and industry associations. Although APUS’s reach and appeal is broad, the institution continues to have an emphasis on serving the military, veteran, and public service communities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 61% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment and approximately 13% of APUS’s students self-reported being a military veteran.
•National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, which provides nursing education to approximately 2,100 students at five campuses in Ohio in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo and, beginning in April 2020, to students enrolled at a campus in Indianapolis, Indiana. In April 2021, HCN will begin offering classes at a new campus in Akron, Ohio. HCN serves the needs of local nursing and healthcare communities and addresses the persistent supply-demand gap for nurses that is evident nation-wide. HCN offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing, or PN, an Associate Degree in Nursing, or ADN, and a Direct Entry ADN option that offers an accelerated graduation pathway for students who meet certain transfer, academic and entrance exam requirements. Portions of the PN and ADN Programs are taught online. Upon completion of the PN and ADN programs, our HCN students are eligible to take the NCLEX-PN® and NCLEX-RN® exams, respectively, that are administered by National Council Licensure Exams for the licensing of nurses in the United States, Canada, and Australia. 
HCN is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Bureau for Health Education Schools, or ABHES. HCN’s Ohio locations and programs are approved by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, or the Ohio State Board, the Ohio Board of Nursing, or OBN, and the PN Program is accredited by the National League for Nursing Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation, or NLN CNEA.
In April 2020, HCN began classes for the first cohort of students enrolled in the PN Program at HCN’s new campus in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Indiana Board for Proprietary Education/Indiana Commission for Higher Education has authorized HCN to offer instruction at its campus in Indiana, and the Indiana State Board of Nursing granted initial accreditation and authorized the admission of the first cohort of students. HCN has also notified NLN CNEA of the opening of the Indianapolis campus. NLN CNEA approval was not required to begin classes. In January 2021, NLN CNEA completed a virtual focused site visit at HCN’s Indianapolis campus. Based upon the outcome of this focused site visit, NLN CNEA notified HCN that accreditation was granted to HCN’s PN program effective January 13, 2021.
On October 28, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Rasmussen University, a nursing- and health sciences-focused institution serving over 18,000 students at its 24 campuses across six states and online, which we refer to as the Rasmussen Acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, we agreed to purchase from FAH Education, LLC, all of the units of membership interests in Rasmussen LLC, Rasmussen University’s parent company, for $300 million in cash and $29 million in shares of a new series of non-voting preferred stock to be issued at the closing of the Rasmussen Acquisition (or, at our election, up to an additional $29 million in cash in lieu thereof), subject to customary adjustments, including for net working capital, cash and debt of the acquired companies. The Rasmussen Acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions that include, among others, regulatory review by ED, approval by the HLC, and approval by or notices to other regulatory and accrediting bodies. We are relying on the availability of financing under a commitment letter for debt financing, or alternative financing, to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Rasmussen Acquisition. For additional information regarding this transaction, please refer to “– Regulatory Environment – Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations – Rasmussen Acquisition Regulatory Review,” “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Rasmussen Acquisition,” and “Note 3. Acquisition Activity” included in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. 
Reporting Segments
    Our operations are organized into two reporting segments:

COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread disruptions in higher education, particularly with respect to institutions that engage in on-ground delivery of education, and a number of related regulatory developments. In March 2020, in response to the pandemic, we implemented our business continuity plan, at APEI and APUS, and employees not already remote transitioned to a remote workforce. APUS saw no interruption in academic instruction due to this transition. HCN, leveraging the expertise of APUS, temporarily closed all its campuses without interruption to student academic progression and then shifted to a blended model with online delivery of its courses and on-campus delivery of certain labs. HCN later fully reopened its campuses, using smaller in person classes with screening, social distancing, and masking requirements while continuing to offer courses in a virtual setting for those that prefer remote course learning, but reverted to online courses and limited on-campus labs in November 2020 following spikes in COVID-19 cases in Ohio. In addition, in October 2020, HCN began temporarily expanding certain campuses through short-term leases of additional space to be used as lab space in order to accommodate student demand and in compliance with COVID-related public health measures that effectively limit the number of students in each lab class. Despite these challenges, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, APUS experienced an increase in net course registrations, which we believe may have been due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and HCN experienced an increase in new student 
enrollment, which we believe was due in part to an increase in demand for nursing education and a change in the competitive environment due to COVID-19. For more information on the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and related risks, please refer to the sections entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.
On March 27, 2020, Ohio enacted a COVID-19 emergency relief law that allows individuals who have successfully completed a nursing education program approved by OBN to receive a temporary license to practice as an RN or LPN before taking the NCLEX. Graduates of OBN-approved nursing education programs, such as HCN’s programs, were permitted to apply for a temporary license that was valid until March 1, 2021, at which time it expired. 
In March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, in response to COVID-19 and its related effects. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many higher education institutions shifted to distance learning as campuses shut down as a result of the public health emergency. The CARES Act includes provisions designed to provide relief to higher education institutions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act created the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, or HEERF, that includes $12.6 billion in funding for higher education institutions. The CARES Act authorizes ED to allocate funding based on a statutory formula that accounts for the relative share of full-time students who are Pell Grant recipients. Students who were enrolled exclusively in distance education courses prior to the COVID-19 emergency are excluded from this calculation and, therefore, wholly online institutions were not eligible to receive an allocation of funding under the HEERF. ED allocated $3.1 million for HCN and in May 2020, HCN received its HEERF allocation, 100% of which was subsequently disbursed to eligible students. No allocation of HEERF funds was made to APUS by ED. 
The CARES Act requires recipient institutions to use at least 50% of their HEERF funds to provide emergency grants to students for expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. The CARES Act also permits institutions to use up to 50% of their HEERF funds to cover any costs associated with significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to COVID-19, so long as such costs do not include payment to contractors for the provision of pre-enrollment recruitment activities, endowments, or capital outlays associated with facilities related to athletics, sectarian instruction, or religious worship. Although HCN incurred costs to shift its operations and delivery of instruction in light of COVID-19, it chose to distribute its entire HEERF allocation directly to eligible students. By June 30, 2020, HCN had distributed its entire allocation of $3.1 million in HEERF funds to eligible students. HCN has timely made required reports regarding use of its HEERF allocation under the CARES Act.
The CARES Act also includes waivers of certain Higher Education Act provisions related to the federal student financial aid programs in order to provide regulatory flexibility to institutions in connection with COVID-19-related disruptions. The CARES Act modifies processes related to the return of unearned Title IV funds in connection with student withdrawals during the COVID-19 pandemic, extends time limits for Pell Grants and Direct Loans as a result of withdrawals during this period, allows for flexibility in measuring the satisfactory academic progress of students, and permits institutions to continue making federal work study payments to students who can no longer meet work study obligations during the pandemic.
In December 2020, Congress passed the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, or the CAA, which included the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, or the CRRSAA, which contained several education-related provisions. The CRRSAA appropriated an additional $22.7 billion for the HEERF to be distributed to higher education institutions. The CRRSAA allocation formula differs from the CARES Act formula in several ways, including new allocations for institutions on the basis of the number of students enrolled exclusively in distance education. Under this formula, ED allocated approximately $600,000 for APUS and $2.0 million for HCN. Each institution has until April 15, 2021, to accept its allocation. The CRRSAA places limitations on the expenditure of funds that were not applicable to CARES Act funds. Specifically, the CRRSAA requires proprietary institutions to spend their entire new HEERF allocation on direct financial aid grants. The CRRSAA further specifies that institutions should provide grants based on financial need, with special emphasis on grants to students eligible for Pell Grants. However, the CRRSAA is also more flexible than the CARES Act in that it explicitly authorizes the allocation of financial aid grants to students enrolled in distance education. The CAA also includes additional provisions related to higher education. Relevant changes include an increase in the maximum Pell Grant for the 2021-2022 award year and significant shortening of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).
ED has issued several guidance documents regarding the appropriate use of HEERF funds and related reporting requirements and regarding regulatory flexibility in the administration of federal student aid as a result of challenges related to COVID-19. These guidance documents provide institutions further information on allowable practices for the administration of federal work study, measurement of satisfactory academic progress, and proper return of unearned federal student aid to ED. ED has also extended a temporary freeze on payments and interest for federal student loans until at least September 30, 2021.
We cannot predict the extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or related regulatory activity or legislative may impact us or our institutions. 
Postsecondary Education Market Characteristics

    The postsecondary education market in the United States is large (with over 4,500 institutions), diverse in its business models, and fragmented such that no one institution has a significant market share. Most postsecondary institutions, including for-profit postsecondary institutions, regardless of where they are located, how they are organized, or who they serve, face significant challenges, including:
•Enrollment Declines: In the United States, student enrollment declined in the fall of 2020 by 2.5% at postsecondary institutions participating in the student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA, or Title IV programs, as compared to the same period the previous year. Although four-year for-profit institution student enrollment increased 5.3% in the fall of 2020, this follows declines in prior years. 
•Affordability: There is a continued focus on the cost of a college education and a resulting impact on access as well as on the high level of college student indebtedness.
•Quality: Postsecondary institutions face questions from lawmakers, the media, potential students, and others about the quality of academic programs, and face additional questions in light of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on postsecondary education. 
•Competition: Competition exists from lower cost alternatives and from non-traditional competitors, such as those offering competency-based education, or CBE, programs, coding bootcamps, credentialing programs, micro-credentials, corporate training, and other alternative educational paths that offer flexible and individualized programs.
•Relevance: Challenges exist regarding the ability to translate the value of a postsecondary education into economic mobility. Postsecondary institutions must prepare students with relevant skills to work in new and rapidly changing industries, respond to technological change, and support employers in efforts to optimize and advance their workforce.
•Flexibility: Postsecondary institutions must address the needs of students who are balancing education with other demands on their time.
•Technological Demands: Rapidly evolving technology is transforming the education industry in ways that were unpredictable even at the beginning of 2020. This transformation has been accelerated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced institutions, their employees and their students to adapt to widespread remote learning and has challenged institutions in particular to do so effectively, efficiently and securely.

    Despite these challenges, postsecondary institutions, and the credentials they grant, have an important role to play in enabling social and economic mobility. Occupations that require a postsecondary credential have been projected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to grow at a faster rate through 2026 than those that do not require a postsecondary education, and most of the fastest-growing occupations will need postsecondary education.
    Institutions that predominantly serve adult learners must address the particular needs of that population. According to the Lumina Foundation, approximately 38% of students enrolled in U.S. degree granting institutions are over the age of 25, and approximately 58% of these students are working adults. Today’s adult learners, including military service members, are often working with extended or irregular work schedules, have family obligations, travel or relocate frequently, and have limited financial resources. In December 2019, the Lumina Foundation, Strada Education Network, and Gallup released findings from an education consumer survey of approximately 42,000 adults aged 25-64 with some college credit, but no degree, and who are not currently enrolled in a postsecondary institution. Key findings included the following: 
•the most common reason cited for not continuing coursework was difficulty balancing school and work;
•the factors that would have the most impact on getting this population to re-enroll are affordability, schedule flexibility, and a guaranteed employment outcome connected to further education;
•only 19 percent of these adults reported that they were no longer interested in completing or did not need to complete their education; and 
•cost and time pressures continued to be barriers preventing these adults from re-enrolling.
Opportunities
Opportunities for APUS
    With nearly 2.2 million active duty military and reservists, the U.S. military community will continue to be an important market segment for online education. Because of their particularly irregular schedules, frequent deployments, and access to tuition assistance funding, we believe service members will continue to seek respected universities that provide military-focused support services coupled with an online curriculum and flexible scheduling. We believe service members are particularly interested in postsecondary credentials that offer both career advancement and preparation for employment outside of the military. As part of their longstanding tradition, military leaders often encourage service members to use their earned education benefits, and to enhance their qualifications, for purposes of the military’s compensation, promotion, assignment, and performance systems.
    The Department of Defense, or DoD, uniform tuition assistance program, or TA, offers active duty, National Guard and reserve component service members a variety of education and financial aid options. Additionally, veterans (and certain service members) are entitled to educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA. For more information, refer to “Our Institutions - Sources of Student Financing” and “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.”
    The U.S. military is demonstrating increased levels of support for credentials other than degrees. Credentialing Opportunities Online, or COOL, is a program for each of the military branches and DoD civilians that links experience with certification. While benefits vary by service, service members may be eligible for assistance in paying for certifications, including by vouchers, reimbursement, or grants. Students must meet certain eligibility requirements in order to receive credentialing assistance, including in some cases service time, experience, and eligibility requirements for military tuition assistance, or TA, benefit programs. The Army offers an expanded credentialing program called the Army Credentialing Assistance Program, or CA. CA is a program designed to support soldiers who wish to pursue civilian credentials, licenses, and certifications that may lead directly to a specific job, particularly in areas outside of a soldier’s Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). Through CA, soldiers can receive reimbursement for fees associated with qualifying programs listed on Army COOL. APUS became an approved training provider for CA programs in October 2019, while CA was in an expanded user test, and Army-wide implementation of CA began in January 2020. We believe other service branches may follow the Army’s example or pursue other approaches to enhancing support for credentialing. Students in the Army utilizing both TA and CA are subject to a combined cap on benefit amounts.
    We believe that military veterans represent another important addressable market for online education. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there were 1.5 million veterans aged 18 to 34 and another 4.0 million veterans aged 35 to 54 in 2019. Of the 9.0 million veterans aged 18 to 64, approximately 77% were part of the labor force, but only approximately 29% had a bachelor’s degree or higher. We believe that our military heritage, affordability, and online offerings are attractive to veterans in the pursuit of career advancement and employment outside of the military.
    Elected and private-industry leaders are heavily promoting new policies and campaigns to facilitate the hiring of veterans, supporting a transition from military service to the workforce. As these policies lower barriers to non-military jobs and facilitate veteran-owned businesses, online universities offer valuable educational opportunities for veterans regardless of where they live, work, or learn.
More broadly, U.S. employers are increasingly reporting significant gaps between required job skills and the current capabilities of their workforce. In a 2019 survey on behalf of CareerBuilder, the Harris Poll found that 50% of human resource managers surveyed had jobs they could not fill because they could not find qualified talent. Working adults also recognize the need to be lifelong learners. Udemy’s 2019/2020 Global Skills Gap Report found that 83% of workers surveyed said that they believe there is a skills gap and 62% thought skills needed for their jobs would change. The makeup of the labor market is also contributing to the need for more skilled workers. High-skill occupations, defined as those where at least 80% of online job postings for that position request a bachelor’s degree or higher, have 25% more openings than available workers, according to a 2018 Burning Glass Technologies report. This report also noted a need for improved alignment between educators and employers, and a rapidly changing labor market. We believe a growing number of employers and professional associations will seek partnerships with academic institutions to advance the skills and productivity of their workforce through higher education and training programs. 
Opportunities for Hondros
 On a national level, the expanding need for healthcare coupled with a nursing shortage is driving demand for nursing education. Job opportunities for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses are expected to grow between approximately 7% and 9% annually from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average growth for all other occupations according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2020-21 Edition. The demand for nurses in Ohio is similar to national demand: job opportunities for licensed practical nurses and registered nurses in Ohio are expected to grow between 
approximately 9.5% and 14.2% annually from 2016 to 2026 according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services’ 2026 Ohio Job Outlook report. However, despite the anticipated growth in job opportunities, over 80,000 qualified applications nationwide were not accepted by entry-level baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. These statistics suggest there may be unmet demand from qualified students for nursing educational programs.
Competition
Competition for APUS
    Within the postsecondary education market, APUS competes primarily with not-for-profit, public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. We believe APUS’s primary competitors include Arizona State University, University of Arizona Global Campus (formerly Ashford University), Capella University, Grand Canyon University, Liberty University, Penn State University, Purdue Global, Southern New Hampshire University, Strayer University, University of Maryland Global Campus (formerly University of Maryland University College), University of Phoenix, and flagship and mid-size state universities offering degree programs online. 
    We believe the competitive factors in the U.S. postsecondary education market include:
•quality of the academic program, including alignment to high growth sectors of the job market;
•affordability;
•breadth of degree offerings;
•flexibility in delivery models;
•frequency of course or program starts; 
•experience of faculty members engaged in the practice of their fields;
•level of support for student success;
•career counseling and placement services;
•reputation among prospective students, employers, and other stakeholders; 
•effectiveness of marketing efforts in attracting college-ready students; and
•track record of strong compliance.
    Due to the increase in online postsecondary offerings, which has accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with continued postsecondary enrollment declines in the United States, APUS could face increased competition as fewer students pursue degree-based postsecondary education from a wider selection of online offerings. Furthermore, we anticipate increased competition from campus-based postsecondary institutions as they continue to increase the number of online degree programs and develop more non-traditional programs for working adult students.
    Increased competition for college-ready students has led to an increase in the cost of advertising in certain marketing channels. Continued increases in the cost of advertising may adversely impact our ability to attract college-ready students and/or increase our student acquisition costs. Moreover, institutions who charge higher tuition than APUS are generally in a position to make larger investments in marketing, specifically in student acquisition.
    In recent years, other providers have started providing non-traditional, credit-bearing, and non-credit-bearing education programs without charge or at a low cost, including:

•institutions offering competency-based education, or CBE, programs, which permit students to control their own pace and progress in a program by demonstrating that they have achieved certain skills or knowledge rather than by earning credit hours; 
•non-traditional competitors, such as entities providing coding bootcamps and micro-credentials; and
•non-traditional competitors that are partnering with universities to offer new alternative educational paths. 
In addition, regulatory changes have increased the availability of federal student financial aid for CBE programs and could create additional competition and drive additional students toward non-traditional education programs.
    Most public institutions are aided by substantial government subsidies. Public and private not-for-profit institutions benefit from government and foundation grants, tax-exempt status, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources not widely available to for-profit institutions. Many public competitors also benefit from longstanding name recognition and are able to directly recruit students in a more cost-effective manner, especially in their local markets.

    For more information on competition within the postsecondary education market, refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Attracting and Retaining Students.”
APUS has focused on serving the military community since its founding as AMU, and the military market continues to be the primary market for APUS. Within the military market, there are more than 2,500 institutions that serve military students and receive funds through the DoD TA program. The primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online instruction, and colleges and universities offering on-campus instruction located near military installations. Over the last several years, a number of APUS’s competitors have expanded their outreach and marketing efforts directed at active duty and reserve service members, as well as veterans.
We believe that APUS will continue to see increased competition in the military community from both not-for-profit and for-profit schools as well as from the Armed Forces themselves. For example, in March 2020, the Navy announced a new “Education Strategy for Seapower 2020” that is intended to be a new comprehensive education strategy. As part of this strategy, the Navy, in cooperation with the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Coast Guard, in January 2021 began piloting online courses for the new United States Naval Community College, a community college supporting naval education for enlisted service members, with plans to enroll as many as 5,000 students into targeted associate’s degree programs with partner colleges and universities in a second pilot phase beginning in 2022. The Armed Forces may also begin offering distance learning through their own institutions.
As traditional not-for-profit public and private schools advance their online capabilities, they will present increasing levels of competition for APUS. At the same time, we believe for-profit schools will continue to market to students eligible for TA and VA education benefits, rather than ED’s Title IV programs, in an attempt to comply with an ED regulatory requirement known as the 90/10 Rule (a rule that imposes sanctions on participating institutions that derive more than 90% of their total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs as calculated under ED’s regulations). This regulatory requirement and certain proposed changes are described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The ‘90/10 Rule’.” In addition, the Armed Forces have established, and may in the future establish, their own postsecondary education programs.
Competition for Hondros
Although HCN has shifted at times to online delivery of its courses and on-campus delivery of certain labs during the COVID-19 pandemic, HCN’s programs are typically offered as campus-based programs to residents in the geographic areas surrounding its campuses. In these geographic areas, HCN competes with other schools offering similar programs, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private colleges. Because of its relatively local focus, HCN’s competitive environment is impacted by various factors that are specific not only to Ohio and Indiana but also to the particular areas of Ohio and Indiana where HCN’s campuses are located, including local supply and demand dynamics for nurses and nursing schools. HCN’s results are therefore more susceptible to the actions of single competitors than the results of an institution that draws from a broader geographical area. For example, a particularly effective or ineffective marketing approach by another school, or the opening or closing of another school, could have unanticipated detriments or benefits to HCN’s competitive position. 
Competitive Strengths
    While many institutions are struggling to determine how to meet the needs of today’s students, both APUS and HCN have focused on consistently delivering high returns on student educational investment, serving busy military and non-military students who are often balancing work and other obligations with school and living expenses with the cost of education.
    The sources of our institutions’ competitive strengths include:
•Affordable Tuition. Affordable tuition has been a priority of APUS since its founding. APUS’s low tuition rates mean that its students are not required to take on as much debt as they might at another institution. The combined tuition and fees at APUS are generally less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. Today, tuition at APUS remains among the lowest in the four-year for-profit sector. To support APUS’s active duty military students using TA, APUS set undergraduate tuition to align with tuition assistance programs available to members of the military, and, effective with courses beginning January 2020, APUS increased its own tuition grant for those master’s students and their spouses and dependents using military TA. As a result, undergraduate and master’s students who are eligible for TA benefits and their spouses and dependents will pay a net tuition of $250 per credit hour, which when combined with the APUS funded book grant means that active duty military utilizing TA may attain a degree at APUS for no out-of-pocket cost. APUS’s low tuition and fees, in combination with APUS funded tuition grants and book grant provided to all undergraduate students, and beginning in 
January 2020, active-duty military students and their spouses and dependents at the master’s level, result in significant savings for students. Since 2001, APUS has provided approximately $144 million in books and materials savings to students from its APUS-funded book grant. Tuition and fees at HCN are also designed to be affordable and competitive with those of similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility, accessibility, and student experience. We believe that, given broad concerns about rising tuition and student loan debt in higher education, there are opportunities to create awareness and attract college-ready students with the primary message of affordability, value, and higher education return on investment, or HEROITM.
•Relevant Offerings Aligned with Student and Employer Demands. Both APUS and HCN offer programs aligned to areas of high growth in the job market as supported by data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and non-governmental organizations. The depth and breadth of APUS’s program offerings are designed to effectively address the diverse needs of students who enter into education programs with vastly different educational and career backgrounds and goals. Our institutions are committed to continually assessing and enhancing our academic programs and our student services to offer a high-quality education and facilitate successful outcomes for our students and graduates. 
APUS offers healthcare, technology, business, cybersecurity, and health information management programs, offers a liberal arts curriculum that supports the development of critical thinking and soft skills in demand by employers, and utilizes Industry Advisory Councils to evaluate its current curriculum and inform the career relevance of programs and degrees, which facilitates efforts to connect APUS’s curriculum to the industries and the students it serves and to deliver a high-quality academic product. 
Similarly, HCN focuses on educational relevance and excellence by hiring experienced nurses and other industry professionals as faculty members while enhancing student services to assist students with courses, labs, and clinical offerings. HCN’s faculty includes individuals with research experience and specialized nursing credentials. HCN has invested in an innovative concept-based curriculum and simulation labs to enhance the student learning experience and improve student success. As a pre-licensure educator, HCN creates new nurses to meet the significant imbalance of supply and demand that exists for nurses. 
•Military Market Leader: APUS traces its roots to AMU, which was founded in 1991 as a distance-learning, graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. Since its founding, APUS has broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, and public service and service-minded communities, with a focus on a broad purpose of “educating those who serve.” Today, APUS is a market leader among active duty military professionals and veterans. APUS is the top provider of education for the U.S. military and veterans, based on the fiscal 2019 TA and VA recipient student enrollment data, as reported by Military Times. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 61% of APUS’s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment. 
•Flexible Delivery / Frequent Entry Points / Focused on Adult Learners. APUS offers online delivery with monthly starts, giving students the opportunity to begin their studies at a time that works for them. Our academic support offerings, from advising and mentoring to library services and career planning, are individualized to students’ needs, designed to support them at each step of their education journey in a format that works best for them. Because students are located worldwide, APUS provides asynchronous, interactive education to students that fits their busy lives. HCN offers programs that accommodate working adults by offering blended online and in-person courses for the PN and ADN Programs, as well as daytime and evening/weekend options at convenient campus locations. In addition, in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, HCN adjusted by shifting its typically in-person courses to a blended model with online delivery of its courses and on-campus delivery of certain labs to the extent required.
Strategy
APEI, through its subsidiary institutions, is focused on providing a Higher Education Return on Investment. We call this HEROITM to reflect not only the value proposition that we make to our prospective and enrolled students but also to recognize the importance of the real “heroes” in the primary student segments that we serve – individuals who serve the country and society at large. APEI’s heritage is one of “educating those who serve” including military and veterans, public service communities like police, firefighters, first responders, nurses, and those who serve the country in fields like homeland security, intelligence, cybersecurity, information technology, and related fields. 
In September 2019, Angela Selden became our Chief Executive Officer. Since then, APEI began and has continued the process of resetting and re-positioning the company for growth. This first phase of the reset and re-positioning was focused on stabilizing and returning the core businesses to growth as well as identifying APEI’s path forward. 
Results in 2020 reflected strong progress towards these goals, as APUS grew net student registrations by 11.5%, made investments in technology to improve the student experience, and allocated additional marketing resources to focus on students for whom our value proposition is highly attractive. At HCN, student enrollments grew 18%, which we believe reflects not just the secular demand for nursing, but the improvements in processes, outcomes, and offerings that HCN implemented.
As we transform the enterprise to focus on sustainable growth, we are also transforming how we think about and define high quality outcomes. As an enterprise that predominantly serves working and/or adult learners, our students are intensely focused on initial job attainment or progression and advancement in a current career path, and we are focused on providing skills and training that can help facilitate that path to employment for our students.
As part of this phase of our transformation for growth, our strategy is organized around areas where we believe we have “the right to win.” That means that we will draw on our heritage of “educating those who serve” to help define our opportunities.
•At APUS, we will continue to focus on being the top educator to active-duty military and veterans. APUS, through AMU, enjoys strong brand recognition with the veterans’ community, and we plan to make our unique value proposition more widely known and accessible to the veterans and military-affiliated communities.

•At HCN, we believe we are well positioned to serve society’s growing need for nurses. We are focused on expanding the nursing opportunities at Hondros through both geographic campus expansion as well as programmatic expansion. In April 2020, HCN began offering classes at a new campus in Indianapolis, Indiana, and in April 2021, HCN will begin offering classes at an additional campus in Akron, Ohio. HCN will continue exploring opportunities to add campus locations, aligned with accreditor requirements, to meet the needs of students and marketplace demands, as well as new nursing and healthcare education programs, such as the Direct Entry ADN option, which was first offered in October 2019.
Consistent with the themes of HEROITM, “educating those who serve”, and being deliberate about where APEI can win in the marketplace, during 2020 we focused on nursing education with an emphasis on pre-licensure programs. Pre-licensure nursing education today is estimated to be approximately 50% of the total nursing education market and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 25% over the next four years as reported in Technavio Nursing Education Report 2020. This focus led to our agreement to acquire Rasmussen University. Upon closing of the transaction, which is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, the acquisition of Rasmussen will create what we believe is the largest pre-licensure national nursing platform in the United States. Rasmussen has over 8,000 nursing students at its 24 campuses across six states and online with over 90% of those students pursuing a pre-licensure nursing degree at the PN, ADN, or BSN (Bachelor of Science, Nursing) level. On its own, Rasmussen enrolls the largest number of ADN students in the United States and together with HCN’s nearly 2,100 nursing students, APEI will oversee what we believe is the largest population of PN and ADN students in the country. Collectively, following the closing of the transaction and assuming the opening of a new campus at Rasmussen in Dallas, Texas and HCN’s new campus in Akron, Ohio, APEI’s nursing footprint will cover 32 campuses across nine states. We believe that the collective scale, programmatic and educational expertise, and regulatory understanding, positions us well to serve society and the medical system needs for nurses.
Both HCN and Rasmussen are primarily focused on “creating new nurses” by preparing and training nursing students to enter the nursing profession as licensed nurses as opposed to furthering the credentials of already-licensed nurses. Given the state and regulatory approvals necessary, the investment in physical campus facilities, the specialized programmatic knowledge and related accreditations, clinical placement requirements, the time to receive approval to grow nursing enrollments and various standards that nursing schools must meet, we believe nursing education – and in particular first or pre-licensure nursing education - provides us with opportunities to distance ourselves from our competitors. 
In addition to its concentration in pre-licensure programs, Rasmussen has developed what we believe to be a comprehensive “ladder” of nursing programs and degrees. This ladder includes the PN, ADN and BSN pre-licensure programs, as well as the post-licensure RN to BSN, MSN and Doctorate of Nurse Practice post-licensure programs, with a Masters programs in Advanced Nurse Practitioner expected to be launched in 2021. We believe that these post-licensure programs offer additional opportunities to serve the nursing profession especially as licensed nurses move into nursing education and nursing administration, often later in their careers. We anticipate future growth across the nursing platform to come from geographic 
campus expansion, both in existing states and new states, programmatic offering expansion as well as potentially through additional acquisitions.
In our next phase of transforming APEI for growth, we intend to focus on expanding on the ways in which we deliver on our goal of “Purpose Made Possible”. We expect to continue to focus on career training and degrees that provide real skills and provide pathways to employment in identifiable jobs. To support growth in our existing businesses and to diversify our business model, we plan to continue to assess and pursue strategic investments and acquisitions in addition to the Rasmussen Acquisition. Our investment and acquisition strategy includes a focus on investing in nursing and healthcare education as well as investing in companies that bridge postsecondary education to employment, to improve economic mobility for adult learners, in particular those in the military, national security and public service communities, through a combination of educational offerings and workforce-related solutions. For additional information regarding our investments and acquisitions, please refer to the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
Our quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments. Our student population also varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these factors. 
Available Information About Us

APEI was incorporated in Delaware in 2002 as the successor to a Virginia corporation incorporated in 1991. Our website is www.apei.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Information on or available through our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.
OUR INSTITUTIONS 
    We provide postsecondary education through two educational institutions of higher learning, APUS and HCN. Our institutions are licensed or otherwise authorized by state authorities, or are in the process of obtaining such licenses or authorizations, to offer postsecondary education programs to the extent the institutions believe such licenses or authorizations are required, and are certified by the U.S. Department of Education, or ED, to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or Title IV.
APEI performs certain business functions, including human resources, marketing, legal services, finance, facilities services, information technology and strategic analytics and research on a shared basis for the benefit of APUS and in some cases HCN, with the capability to expand those shared services to other entities in the future. We believe that the shared services model promotes the efficient use of resources, allowing our institutions to continue to focus on meeting applicable accreditation standards and maintaining control over the academic and core operational functions necessary to the functioning of an institution of higher learning. We implemented this model for APUS following a multi-year planning and investment process and HLC’s November 2018 approval of APUS’s application for a change in structure related to adoption of the model. As required by HLC policy and ED regulation, HLC conducted a focused site visit in May 2019. The site visit team found sufficient evidence of compliance with the commitments APUS made in its application and with HLC’s Eligibility Requirements and Criteria for Accreditation and did not recommend further follow-up. In August 2019, HLC notified APUS that HLC’s Institutional Actions Council, which conducts reviews and takes action on accreditation recommendations, concurred with the site visit team’s findings.
American Public University System
    APUS is based in Charles Town, West Virginia and has institutional accreditation from HLC, a regional accrediting agency. As mentioned in “Competitive Strengths” above, APUS traces its roots to AMU, which was founded in 1991 as a distance-learning, graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. APUS broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, and public service and public service-minded communities with a focus on educating those who serve. In 2002, APUS was organized into a university system with two components: AMU and APU. AMU is focused on educating students from the military, national security, military-affiliated and service communities. APU is focused on educating career-focused working adults with an emphasis on educating professionals working in service-related communities. APUS is an online institution of higher learning, which we believe is well-suited to its students, especially its military, public service and working adult students, many of whom serve in positions requiring extended and irregular work schedules, are on call for rapid response missions, participate in extended deployments and exercises, travel or relocate frequently, must balance family and work demands or are single parents with limited financial resources. Many APUS students have significant prior education and career experiences; 88% are working adults and the average age of APUS students is 32. APUS is designed to serve those students with tailored offerings to support them in successfully reaching their individual goals.
Although APUS’s focus has broadened, it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. Approximately 61% of APUS’s students as of December 31, 2020 self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment. The remainder of APUS’s students are military-affiliated professionals (such as veterans, reservists, or National Guard members), public service professionals (such as law enforcement personnel or other first responders), and other civilians (such as military spouses and working adult students).
Curriculum and Scheduling
APUS offers 241 degree and certificate programs, including one dual degree and four CBE programs. Over 1,700 distinct courses are available in either eight- or sixteen-week formats. Most academic terms begin on the first Monday of each month. APUS’s programs are as follows: 

Programs | Number
Doctoral Degrees | 2 
Master’s Degrees | 45 
Bachelor’s Degrees | 53 
Associate Degrees | 29 
Total Degree Programs: | 129 
Certificates | Number
Graduate | 55 
Undergraduate | 57 
Total Certificates: | 112 
TOTAL PROGRAMS AND CERTIFICATES | 241 


In addition to degree programs, APUS offers 112 certificate programs. APUS’s certificate programs generally require a minimum of 18 credit hours and focus on a particular component of a broader degree program. Students may earn either discrete certificates or certificates in combination with work toward a degree program. APUS currently offers limited enrollment in our four MomentumTM CBE programs, which focus on the achievement of knowledge and skills, providing a more flexible degree path to non-traditional students seeking an alternative to prevailing schedule and tuition constraints. In addition, APUS offers several “Learning Tracks” that are comprised of three academic courses in a related area of interest. Like a microcredential, a Learning Track allows students to pursue a course of study without having to commit to a degree or certificate program. For a full list of our degree and certificate programs, please see catalog.apus.edu. Information on or available through our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. 
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, 24% of APUS students were enrolled in business, 22% in security and global studies programs, and 22% in arts and humanities, with the remainder of students in science, technology, education and 
math, and health sciences. During that period, 59% of students were enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program, 17% in an associate degree program, 15% in a master’s degree program, and 9% in certificate or other programs. 
    Student Recruitment and Marketing 

    APUS’s relationship-based marketing strategy focuses on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military, military-affiliated, and public service communities. We rely on outreach teams, which serve these communities and foster long-standing relationships, as the core of this strategy. We believe APUS’s reputation as a trusted educator positions APUS as a respected institution among certain federal and private sector employers. These relationships, as well as APUS’s student and alumni networks, also cultivate personal referrals. We believe that this relationship-based marketing approach enables APUS to achieve lower student acquisition costs than otherwise would be achieved if it focused more heavily on traditional media advertising.
    APUS supplements relationship-based marketing with multichannel, data-driven marketing campaigns to create greater brand awareness, particularly for academically prepared potential students outside the military, military-affiliated, and service communities. In these campaigns, APUS utilizes, among other marketing channels, digital marketing channels such as organic and paid search, APUS owned and external content and social marketing communities, linear and digital TV advertising, radio advertising, and print advertising. Increased competition in paid marketing channels has resulted in higher advertising costs in certain marketing channels and could lead to increased student acquisition costs. To better manage costs and focus marketing efforts on prospective student audiences most likely to matriculate and succeed, APUS utilizes tools to provide new insights connecting individual student performance data with third-party audience insights and the marketing touch points that attracted them. APUS is using these insights and other highly personalized approaches to improve future decisions with respect to marketing mix allocation, audience targeting, new initiatives, relevant messaging, and creative decisions, as well as to more effectively and deeply leverage platform tools that support scalable advertising development, delivery, and testing.
    APUS also provides more than 200 partner organizations with a range of services to maximize strategic workforce development goals, including dedicated client services, admissions support, custom program webpages, direct payment options for eligible institutions, and tuition grants.
APUS has a long-standing commitment to affordability. Comparably, APUS costs are about 30% less than the average in-state full-time undergraduate tuition, fees, and books at public universities, according to the final 2018-19 institutional data reported to the U.S. Department of Education through The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. Undergraduate full-time tuition, fees, and average book costs are based on a course load of 24 credit hours per year. APUS’s tuition changed effective January 1, 2020, as discussed below.
    Based on data obtained from digital research and direct audience insights, we believe that APUS’s affordability and value proposition is highly attractive to purpose-driven adult learners who seek affordable, accessible education offerings that are aligned with in-demand fields where they can make a difference. In 2020, we launched a new marketing campaign focusing on affordability and higher education return on investment for learners. Our commitment to affordability, particularly compared to that of other four-year public and private institutions, strongly resonates given this audience’s deep concern for saving money and their reluctance to take on debt. Learners are looking for a practical solution; one that provides a return for their educational investment and fits their lifestyle and values. We believe APUS is recognized among education providers in this respect. In fact, APUS ranks in the top 2% for return on investment compared to colleges and universities nationwide, according to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce report, “A First Try at ROI: Ranking 4,500 Colleges,” based on the 40-year net present value for completers who received federal financial aid.
APUS continues to work to enhance the student learning experience to attract students who are more likely to persist and succeed in its programs and will continue to work to identify and implement changes and initiatives in an effort to more effectively attract and enroll more college-ready students on average. These initiatives may include updates to admissions standards, which may have an adverse effect on APUS’s enrollment and our financial condition. For additional information on the risk factors associated with these initiatives and the APUS admissions process please refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.”
Student Body and Enrollment
The student body of APUS consists of approximately 90,400 enrolled students, most of whom hold full-time employment. Student enrollment is defined as the number of unique active students, including those who take an approved leave of absence, who are currently attending a course or have completed at least one course within the last 12 months. 
APUS is focused on executing initiatives that will more effectively support its students and help improve those students’ educational outcomes, including through faculty engagement initiatives and co-curricular initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom and strengthen the bond between APUS and its students. Improved engagement is an important element in APUS’s goal of retaining qualified students.
    Accreditation
APUS has institutional accreditation from HLC, a regional institutional accrediting agency recognized by ED. The status and meaning of this accreditation is described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.” The next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for the 2020-2021 academic year, with a related site visit scheduled to occur in April 2021. 
In addition to accreditation by HLC, certain programs offered by APUS have received specialized accreditations or professional recognition. For example, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, or ACBSP, generally accredits 21 different business-focused academic programs offered by APUS and accredits two APUS accounting programs under a specialized accounting accreditation. 
The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, or CCNE, accredits the Bachelor and Master of Science in Nursing programs. In addition, APUS has obtained professional recognition for its program concentrations in Human Resources from the Society for Human Resource Management, for certain courses in the Sports and Health Sciences program from the American Sport Education Program for Bronze Level Certification and the National Academy of Sports Medicine Performance Enhancement Specialist, for the Information Systems Security program from the National Security Agency - Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation, and for certain courses in the Human Development and Family Studies program from the National Council on Family Relations for the Certified Family Life Educator. 
APUS’s Master of Public Health program holds accreditation from the Council on Education for Public Health, or CEPH. In addition, the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress, or IFSAC, has accredited five APUS programs.
    Student Admissions 
    APUS welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time through an online application process. The current qualification for most undergraduate programs is a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. Applicants for graduate programs must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited U.S. institution or an equivalent foreign institution. Certain programs may have additional admissions standards and restrictions. 
    Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid

    We believe that APUS’s commitment to maximizing a student’s return on their educational investment is one of its competitive strengths. We are focused on offering our students affordable programs, and many APUS students also transfer a significant number of previously earned academic credit hours, which reduces the remaining credit hours required to earn their degrees, and therefore reduces the cost of the degree.
Effective January 1, 2020, APUS implemented the following tuition changes for undergraduate and master’s course registrations:
•The tuition for undergraduate level courses increased $15 per credit hour to $285 per credit hour.
•The tuition for master’s level courses increased $20 per credit hour to $370 per credit hour.
•The technology fee increased from $50 to $65 per class.
The January 2020 tuition increase was APUS’s first increase since July 2015 and was intended to help support increased investments in academic learning and student operations. Prior to the 2015 increase, APUS had not raised undergraduate tuition for 15 years or graduate tuition for four years. In general, a bachelor’s degree may be earned for $34,485 in tuition costs at current tuition rates, and APUS master’s degrees may be earned for $13,320 in tuition at current tuition rates. The combined tuition, fees, and books at APUS are designed to be less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university.
Undergraduate students and, effective January 1, 2020, all active duty military students and their spouses and dependents, enrolled in courses for academic credit receive their textbooks and certain course materials at no additional cost to them through an APUS-funded institutional book-grant program. This book grant represents an approximate savings over the 
course of a student’s undergraduate degree program of $1,240 annually as compared to public four-year colleges and universities, according to comparative information from The College Board’s Trends in College Pricing 2020 report. APUS also utilizes open access and online library materials where appropriate and works with various publishers to reduce the cost of textbooks and course materials for both graduate students who pay for textbooks and course materials and for APUS who funds the book grant.
To support APUS's active duty military students using TA, effective January 1, 2020, APUS increased its APUS funded tuition grant for those undergraduate students and their spouses and dependents from $20 to $35 per credit hour to keep the cost at $250 per credit hour, and increased its APUS funded tuition grant for those master’s students and their spouses and dependents from $25 to $120 per credit hour to reduce the cost from $325 per credit hour to $250 per credit hour for active duty military students. As a result, undergraduate and master’s students who are eligible for TA benefits and their spouses and dependents will pay a net tuition of $250 per credit hour. APUS also extended its APUS funded book grant, previously available only to all undergraduate students, to active-duty military students and their spouses and dependents at the master’s level. The net effect of these price and APUS funded grant adjustments is that for active duty military students using TA, an undergraduate or graduate degree at APUS may be attained for no out-of-pocket cost.
APUS’s tuition grant applied to approximately 78% and 68% of its total net course registrations in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
APUS’s tuition grant for veterans expired at the end of 2019. However, veterans who qualify for 100% of their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are expected to continue to have no out-of-pocket expenses. Those veterans who do not qualify for 100% may experience a small increase in out-of-pocket costs, but because APUS is a “Yellow Ribbon” university, many are expected to have access to additional funding resources.
APUS has two applied doctoral programs, Strategic Intelligence and Global Security, that began instruction in January 2018. The programs meet a need for higher-level education and research combined with professional practice in these fields. The doctoral degrees tuition and residency costs are currently $5,600 per term and include an APUS funded book grant for course materials. APUS doctoral degrees may be earned for approximately $50,000 in tuition at current tuition rates.
APUS does not charge an admission fee or fees for services such as registration, course drops, or similar events that trigger fees at many other institutions. Because APUS is an exclusively online institution, there are no required resident fees, such as for parking, food service, student union, and recreation. APUS charges students a technology fee but provides a grant to cover the technology fee for students using TA. When applicable, APUS students are charged certain additional fees, such as graduation, late registration, transcript request, and comprehensive examination fees.
TA covers $250 per credit hour for military students, and these students may also be able to use VA education benefits or aid from ED’s Title IV programs to cover any remaining cost, as described more fully below in “Sources of Student Financing” and “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.” APUS has set its tuition grant so that the TA covers the full tuition cost of undergraduate and graduate courses for members of the military up to the annual maximum allowable benefit. 
    Sources of Student Financing
APUS’s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, TA, VA education benefits, ED’s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. Students utilizing DoD’s tuition assistance programs accounted for 43%, those using VA education benefits 22%, and those utilizing ED’s Title IV programs 21% of APUS’s net course registrations in 2020. We believe that the ability of our students to participate in these programs is essential to APUS’s success. Participation in TA, VA education benefits and ED’s Title IV programs add to APUS’s regulatory burden, as described more fully below in “Regulatory Environment – Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.”
    Federal legislative activity, including government shutdowns and other budgetary actions, as well as actions by ED and DoD, may adversely impact the ability of our students to obtain loans, grants, and other forms of tuition financing. Such actions could include eliminating various education and loan programs, reducing the funds or benefits (or both) available under those programs, or enacting new restrictions on participation in those programs. Any such changes, or any other reductions in or restrictions on funding for such programs, could have a material adverse effect on APUS’s enrollments and our financial condition. The potential risks associated with these and similar events are described more fully below in “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business.”
    Intellectual Property
APUS owns and exercises rights associated with patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. APUS owns all course syllabi and course and instructional materials developed by APUS faculty and employees and, as such, these course materials may be used by APUS in current and future courses as needed to facilitate instruction and may be modified by APUS to meet evolving course or curriculum requirements. In general, APUS does not assert ownership claims to scholarly works of its faculty, such as articles and books, which were not developed as APUS course materials. Such intellectual property of APUS’s individual faculty members remains the property of each such faculty member and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it unless the faculty member grants permission for use by others. APUS relies on agreements under which it obtains rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content providers. APUS owns the copyright for a work by a faculty member if APUS compensated the faculty member for the particular product or if APUS funded the research in whole or in part.
APUS has secured rights to trademarks for various names and terms used in its business, including “American Public University System,” “American Military University,” “American Public University” and logos incorporating the foregoing terms and acronyms of those terms, as well as “Ready When You Are,” “Educating Those Who Serve,” “RESPECTED. AFFORDABLE. ONLINE.,” “COMMITTED TO YOUR FUTURE,” “MASTERS OF DISASTER,” “MOMENTUM,” “HEROI”, “MyMomentum”, and the term “Partnership At a Distance.” These trademarks and brand names are central to a number of APUS’s marketing efforts and we believe they are important to how prospective students identify APUS. APUS also owns rights to more than 200 internet domain names pertaining to APEI, APUS, AMU, APU, and other unique descriptors.
Hondros College of Nursing
    HCN’s programs are designed to prepare individuals for productive careers in the field of nursing. HCN provides nursing education to students enrolled at five campuses in Ohio, which are located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo, and, in April 2020, HCN began offering courses at a new campus in Indianapolis, Indiana. The initial enrollment at the Indianapolis campus was limited to 30 students per year by the Indiana State Board of Nursing. Growth beyond an initial 30 student limit is subject to HCN’s ability to petition to increase the number of admissions after a site visit that will occur upon graduation of the first cohort. In addition, in April 2021, HCN will begin offering classes at a new campus in Akron, Ohio. HCN is institutionally accredited by ABHES, a national accreditor. 
    Curriculum and Scheduling

    HCN offers on-campus instruction leading to a Diploma in PN and an ADN. Portions of the PN and ADN Programs are taught online. Graduates of the PN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a Licensed Practical Nurse, or LPN, after passing the NCLEX-PN exam. Graduates of the ADN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a Registered Nurse, or RN, after passing the NCLEX-RN exam.
    Academic terms for the PN and ADN Programs begin four times each year, with courses starting in January, April, July, and October. Approximately 63% of enrollments for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 were in the PN Program, while 37% were in the ADN Program. HCN’s students principally receive on-campus instruction at one of HCN’s campuses; however, in March 2020, in response to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 global pandemic, HCN, leveraging the expertise of APUS, shifted to a blended model with online delivery of its courses and on campus delivery of certain labs. HCN thereafter fully reopened its campuses, using smaller in person classes with screening, social distancing and masking requirements while continuing to offer courses in a virtual setting for those that prefer remote course learning, and then reverted to online courses and limited on-campus labs in November 2020 following spikes in COVID-19 cases. There can be no assurance when on-campus courses will resume more broadly or to what degree, or that thereafter HCN will not need to again further limit campus interactions or close its campuses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of location regulations. 
    Student Body and Enrollment
HCN provides nursing education to approximately 2,100 students at five campuses in Ohio and one campus in Indiana. The average HCN student is 30 years old and 93% of HCN students are female. 
    Accreditation
    HCN is institutionally accredited by ABHES, a national accrediting agency that is recognized by ED. ABHES informed HCN in February 2020 that based on review of the visit report from its recently completed unannounced visit to HCN’s Columbus campus, the response to the report, and ABHES program approval information, it had acted to affirm the institution’s accreditation, which continues through February 28, 2021. HCN’s next comprehensive evaluation for renewal of accreditation by ABHES had been scheduled for April 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic and related disruptions. ABHES held virtual site visits in lieu of the regular process. In August and September 2020, ABHES conducted virtual site visits to HCN’s campuses to assess compliance with ABHES accreditation standards. The visits resulted in findings that student satisfaction with the ADN and PN Programs at HCN’s Toledo campus and the PN program at HCN’s Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton campuses was below expected levels, which ABHES associated with the transition to online courses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a finding at the Indianapolis and Columbus campuses related to the composition of an advisory board. HCN has formally responded to each of the findings, and ABHES has taken no further action. In February 2021, ABHES granted HCN continued accreditation through February 2027 for all programs at all campuses. For additional information related to HCN’s accreditation, including a discussion of recent correspondence from ABHES related to retention and placement rates at HCN, refer to “Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.”
    HCN’s PN Program received its initial programmatic accreditation through NLN CNEA, with quality improvement conditions, from October 18, 2018 through October 31, 2024. On January 29, 2019, HCN submitted a required progress report to NLN CNEA addressing certain quality indicators. NLN CNEA may accept the report or take certain follow-up actions, such as requesting additional information or conducting a site visit. In December 2020, HCN submitted a response to an NLN CNEA request for additional information regarding a program quality indicator, which was accepted.
In January 2021, NLN CNEA completed a virtual focused site visit at HCN’s Indianapolis campus. Based upon the outcome of this focused site visit, NLN CNEA notified HCN that accreditation was granted to HCN’s PN program effective January 13, 2021.
    Student Recruitment and Marketing
    HCN’s marketing strategy is focused on building long-term relationships with businesses, organizations, and individuals in the healthcare community, primarily in Ohio and Indiana. We believe this strategy will continue to generate a significant number of referrals. In addition, HCN utilizes traditional media as well as digital marketing channels, including organic and paid search marketing.
    Student Admissions
HCN welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time by submitting an application along with an application fee. To be accepted into any HCN program, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, be at least 18 years old at the time of starting the program and hold a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. HCN’s programs also have program-specific admissions requirements.
Applicants for the PN Program and the ADN Program are required to complete an interview with an admissions representative and pass a criminal background check. PN Program applicants are also generally required to pass the Health Education Systems Admissions Assessment. 
Under enhanced ADN Program admissions requirements implemented in 2019, HCN requires external ADN applicants to have an active unencumbered PN license and to have graduated from an approved PN program. ADN Program applicants who apply to start in the quarter immediately following their graduation from HCN’s PN Program may be admitted prior to possessing an active unencumbered PN license but must obtain an active unencumbered PN license prior to the start of their second term. HCN offers a Direct Entry ADN option that offers an accelerated graduation pathway for students who transfer at least 32 college credits to HCN and meet certain academic and entrance exam requirements. Direct Entry ADN applicants are not required to hold an active PN license.
HCN has also made multiple changes to the admissions assessment process since its original implementation and may further modify it in the future in order to better identify college-ready students. These initiatives require significant time, energy, and resources, and if our efforts are not successful, they may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. While we believe changes in admissions and academic achievement requirements are beneficial for our students and will result in a better and more positive educational experience and improved testing pass rates in the long term, we believe some of the changes contributed to a decline in enrollment in previous years and have had a negative impact on our results of operations. We continue to work on identifying an appropriate balance of admissions requirements, academic achievement requirements and attracting appropriate students. However, even if these initiatives lead to the identification and 
enrollment of students who are likely to succeed and improve the student experience, they could result in adverse impacts on HCN enrollments.
    Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid
    HCN’s tuition costs vary among its programs. HCN’s PN Programs may be completed for approximately $20,000 in tuition and fees and the ADN Program may be completed for approximately $28,500 in tuition and fees, depending on the campus location. Fees include the cost of examination review materials, lab fees, test review fees, and fees for applications with OBN, among others. Some of these costs are payable to HCN and others are payable to third parties. 
    HCN’s students also incur costs for textbooks, supplies, uniforms, and its technology package. These costs vary among HCN’s programs and are paid for by HCN’s students as the textbooks or supplies are needed. HCN estimates that over the life of its programs a student’s costs related to textbooks and supplies will be approximately $2,100 for the PN Program and $3,400 for the ADN Program. 
    Sources of Student Financing
    HCN’s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, VA education benefits, ED’s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, corporate reimbursement programs, and beginning in July 2018, HCN’s extended payment plan option. Most HCN students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. The substantial majority of HCN’s revenue is derived from students utilizing ED’s Title IV programs, which results in increased regulatory scrutiny, as discussed more fully below in “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The ‘90/10 Rule.’” As a result, HCN’s management may find it necessary to decrease HCN’s enrollment of students utilizing the Title IV programs or pursue other approaches, any of which could have a negative impact on its operating results and financial condition.

    HCN offers an extended payment plan option to its students. The extended payment plan option is designed to assist students with educational costs consisting of tuition, textbooks, and fees, and are only available after all other student financial assistance has been applied to those costs. Payment plans require monthly payments while the student is enrolled in a program and extend for a period up to six months after the last day of attendance or graduation. To the extent interest is applied, it is generally fixed and does not accrue until the student departs the program or graduates. The extended payment plan option does not impose any origination fees. Participants are advised about the terms of the extended payment plan option and counseled to use all federal funding options first.

Beginning January 1, 2020, HCN began offering an institutional affordability grant to students demonstrating financial need to cover the difference between the total cost of tuition and fees less the amount of all eligible financial aid resources. The grant is designed to limit a student’s monthly payment to $200 through an award of up to $200 per month, or $600 per term after consideration of financial aid, employer tuition reimbursement, and other financial resources. 
    Intellectual Property
In connection with our acquisition of HCN, we received a royalty-free, irrevocable, exclusive, transferable, sublicensable license to use the name “Hondros College of Nursing” and, instead of “Nursing,” any other qualifier directly related to nursing, medicine, or healthcare in connection with the business and operations of HCN.
HCN exercises rights associated with copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. 
Information Technology
    Information technology systems are an essential part of our student experience and our business operations. APEI provides information technology services to APUS and HCN through the shared services model that we implemented following HLC’s November 2018 approval of APUS’s application for a change in structure related to adoption of the model. Previously, APUS had managed its own information technology infrastructure and services and provided information technology services to HCN through an intercompany arrangement. We believe we will need to continue, and potentially increase, our investment of time and money in technology operations and enhancements to support our systems and mission.
    We continue to make investments in information technology. We recently embarked on a multi-year technology transformation program in an effort to enable APUS to better accommodate new flexible learning modalities, improve the operational effectiveness of our enterprise, and enhance the learning experience for students and faculty. Importantly:
•The first cohort of students began studies on APUS’ new learning management system in March 2020, and we have largely completed migration to the new system.
•In January 2020, APUS signed a contract to consolidate its customer relationship management systems onto a single platform. 
•We are actively evaluating migration of key applications, systems, and data to the cloud rather than in our own co-located data centers. 
Our legacy systems include a customized student information and services system that we refer to as Partnership At a Distance™, or PAD, and proprietary information systems and processes to support PAD, into which we have invested significant time and money. PAD is APUS’s platform for interacting with our students. PAD is an information system designed to enable APUS to provide each student with individualized support at appropriate times from pre-enrollment through and beyond graduation, including student advising, administrative support, and community networking. PAD is used by APUS to manage admissions, online orientation, course registrations, tuition payments, grade reporting, progress toward degrees, and various other functions. We continually evaluate PAD for possible changes and upgrades and anticipate that we will eventually make significant changes to this system, as well. 
    APUS and HCN historically used Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment, or Sakai CLE, an open-source learning management system, for their online classroom to support teaching, learning, research, and collaboration. We began replacing Sakai with a cloud-based commercial system as our learning management system in 2020 and have largely completed the APUS migration to the new system. HCN anticipates completing its migration in 2021. PAD and our learning management system are our two core enterprise systems. We also have several other systems that are used in the online campus, and to support the student experience, financial aid processing, financial management, human resources processes, marketing, and decision support.
    The backbone of our information technology infrastructure currently consists of two co-location data centers. Our technology environment is managed internally. Student access to our systems is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers. We have begun migrating and intend to migrate much of our infrastructure and core applications, in addition to our learning management system, to a cloud computing model with the goal of improving the reliability, scalability, agility, and security of our core infrastructure and applications. 

Our continued investments of time and money on our institutions’ information technology may place a strain on our organization that could adversely affect our systems, controls, and operating efficiency, and those of our institutions, and as a result of unsuccessful development efforts, or a result of replacing outdated technology, software, or other technology related assets, we may have assets that become impaired. In addition, as a result of our reliance on information technology, system disruptions and security breaches could adversely affect our reputation and our operations. For additional information regarding risks related to our information technology, refer to “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Technology Infrastructure.”
For more information on these investments and their effects on our results of operations, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview.”
Human Capital 
“Purpose Made Possible.” Our ability to deliver on our corporate mission and our enterprise transformation is tightly aligned with our human capital strategy. Our performance largely depends on the talents, experience, and efforts of our employees, and by our ability to foster a culture and practice of high performance, innovation, cooperation, integrity, and respect. During 2020, our key human capital efforts were focused on building our leadership strength by hiring new executives and working to create a culture of high performance by launching actions to attract, retain and develop high quality talent. We employ various human resource programs in support of these objectives. We hired a new Chief Human Resources Officer, which reflects the importance we place on our people and our commitment to supporting them in their efforts to help us achieve our mission. We launched processes to evaluate our reward and recognition systems and are evaluating market competitive compensation and benefit practices to attract new employees and reward current ones. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked to ensure a safe and seamless transition to remote working for APUS and APEI and blended working for HCN in March 2020. 
We believe diversity and inclusion are at the core of our values and reflect the expectations of the students we serve. We champion equality and work to create ethical, safe, and supportive workplaces where our employees thrive. We believe a diverse and inclusive workplace results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent and a more engaged workforce. 
We measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis to solicit feedback and understand views of our employees, faculty and culture. The results from engagement surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance employee and faculty engagement and improve the experience. 
Workforce Demographics
We have approximately 2,940 employees, including 1,930 full- and part-time faculty members, 450 of which are full-time, and 1,010 other professional staff to administer academic, technology, service, and business operations. APUS employs approximately 1,790 full- and part-time faculty members and APEI and APUS employ approximately 890 other professional staff. HCN employs approximately 140 full- and part-time faculty members and approximately 120 other professional staff. At APUS, approximately 67% of our full-time faculty have a terminal degree in their field of study. At HCN, all nursing faculty have earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing or higher. None of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement, and management considers employee relations to be good. 
Our employees have diverse backgrounds, influenced in part by the geography in which our headquarters, administrative facilities, and campuses are located, and by the communities we serve, in particular nursing, military, military-affiliated, and veteran communities. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 65% of our faculty and staff at APEI and APUS were female and 19% of these positions were held by persons self-identifying as ethnically diverse. At HCN, approximately 76% of our faculty and staff are female and 27% of these positions are held by persons self-identifying as ethnically diverse. 
Talent Development
Our strategic initiatives require our management, faculty, staff, and skilled personnel to perform at a high level and to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. APUS requires each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification to teach at APUS and assignment to courses. All faculty members participate in annual faculty-development opportunities and requirements. Faculty retention at APUS is high, which we believe is primarily due to the online, asynchronous nature of APUS instruction.
HCN trains and develops new faculty through a formal, structured on-boarding, training, and mentoring program. All new HCN faculty members receive a 90-day on-boarding experience, which includes a formal orientation to the organization, policies and procedures, teaching strategies, performance expectations, and role responsibilities. HCN competes with both nursing schools and traditional employers of healthcare professionals for open faculty positions. Due to COVID-19, there has been an increase in demand for nursing professionals, impacting our ability to recruit and retain faculty at HCN. 
APUS and HCN regularly review the performance of faculty by, among other things, monitoring the contact that faculty have with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students.
Impact of COVID-19
We are committed to the health and well-being of our employees. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented our business continuity plan and substantially all of our APEI and APUS employees transitioned to a remote workforce, using digital platforms and virtual collaboration tools to communicate with one another and our institutions’ students. Since then, we have cautiously allowed certain employees to return to an office work setting, following all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local guidelines and regulations. Employees are continuing to follow a blended model of working onsite and remotely, and we have committed to determining the optimal mix of site-based, flexible, and fully remote models on a department and role basis for a post-pandemic environment. 
Faculty and Staff for APEI and APUS
APUS’s faculty consists of approximately 1,790 full and part-time faculty members with relevant teaching and practitioner experience. APEI and APUS also employ approximately 890 professional non-faculty staff to administer APUS’s academic, technology, service, and business operations. Most of APEI’s and APUS’s non-faculty employees are based at its headquarters in Charles Town, West Virginia.
APUS has approximately 350 full-time faculty members with the remainder designated as part-time. APUS establishes full-time and part-time positions based on program and course enrollment. Many of APUS’s full-time faculty began their careers with APUS as part-time faculty. We expect that APUS’s faculty headcount and the composition of full-time and part-time faculty will vary with fluctuations in enrollment.
We believe that APUS’s well-regarded faculty, which includes many former and current practitioners in their fields, attracts new students to APUS. A significant majority of APUS’s graduate faculty members hold terminal degrees or doctorates in their relevant fields, and virtually all undergraduate faculty members hold graduate degrees. Exceptions have been granted for a limited number of APUS’s faculty members who do not meet degree standards, but who provide evidence of significant experience and achievement in the field of study that they teach, in accordance with APUS’s faculty quality guidelines. Many APUS faculty members have relevant experience at other universities and within military, corporate, and government institutions.
We believe that the quality of APUS’s faculty is critical to the student experience and student outcomes and is therefore vital to APUS’s success. APUS regularly reviews the performance of its faculty by, among other things, monitoring the online contact that faculty have with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. If APUS determines that a faculty member is not performing at an acceptable level, it works with the faculty member to improve performance by assigning the faculty member a mentor, providing additional training and/or coaching the faculty member for success. If the faculty member’s performance does not improve, APUS will no longer employ that faculty member to teach. APUS does not offer tenure to faculty members.
We believe that the composition of APUS’s student body and curriculum are particularly attractive to potential faculty members because of the opportunity to teach relevant material to students who can implement higher education learning at their workplaces. APUS recruits faculty members through referrals by current faculty members, advertisements in higher education and trade association journals and its internet presence. Upon selection for a position, APUS requires each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification to teach at APUS and assignment to courses. All faculty members participate in annual faculty-development opportunities and requirements.
Faculty and Staff for Hondros
HCN’s faculty consists of approximately 140 faculty members with relevant teaching and nursing or healthcare practitioner experience. HCN also employs approximately 120 professional staff members who administer HCN’s academic, technology, service, and business operations. 
HCN has approximately 104 full-time faculty members with the remainder designated as part-time. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the PN Program must have earned the minimum of a bachelor’s degree in nursing. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the ADN Program must have earned the minimum of a master’s degree. All HCN faculty whose instruction is nursing theory-based must have an active license to practice as a Registered Nurse. In addition to the formal education of HCN’s faculty members, many have also obtained specialized certifications in the field of nursing. 
We believe that selecting well-educated and qualified faculty members is important to HCN’s opportunity for success. In addition to having the necessary educational requirements, HCN seeks faculty members who have demonstrated experience in the field of nursing. Almost all faculty who teach HCN’s nursing courses have nursing experience in a clinical setting, which we believe helps teach HCN’s students the skills needed to be effective and safe caregivers. 
HCN trains and develops new faculty through a formal, structured on-boarding, training, and mentoring program. All new HCN faculty members receive a 90-day on-boarding experience, which includes a formal orientation to the organization, policies and procedures, teaching strategies, performance expectations, and role responsibilities.

Dr. Smith previously also held various positions at Northern Arizona University and Rio Salado College.

    REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
In the United States, postsecondary education institutions are regulated by (i) accrediting agencies, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government through ED. APUS and HCN are approved to participate in military tuition assistance programs administered by the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, and veterans’ education benefits programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, and our institutions are therefore also subject to oversight by those agencies. Regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies address the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, and financial operations and condition.
The postsecondary education regulatory environment is complex and continues to evolve. Changes in or new interpretations of law, regulations, standards, and policies could have material consequences for our institutions’ accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under student financial assistance programs, and costs of doing business. The postsecondary education regulatory environment has changed and may change in the future as a result of U.S. federal elections, including as a result of the U.S. federal elections that took place in November 2020. As a result of this election, Democrats, who tend to support more regulation of and restrictions on for-profit institutions, gained control of the executive branch and both houses of Congress. The new Presidential administration and new Congress may act to change or eliminate currently effective legislation and ED regulations, or to enact new legislation, and ED, under new leadership, could initiate new rulemaking processes to alter existing regulations and could act to change existing ED policies and practices with respect to matters related to postsecondary education institutions. For example, the Trump Administration delayed the implementation of, repealed, and amended certain regulations promulgated during the prior administration. We cannot predict the extent to which the new Presidential Administration and new Congress will act to change or eliminate or to implement new ED regulations, policies, and practices, nor can we predict the form that new regulations, policies, or practices may take.
The relevant committees in the previous Congress held hearings and considered various policy and legislative proposals related to reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1964, as amended, or the HEA. We cannot predict the 
extent to which the Executive Branch and new Congress will act to reauthorize the HEA or change or eliminate ED regulations, policies, and practices, nor can we predict the form that new legislation, regulations, policies, or practices may take.
We cannot predict the extent to which any potential regulatory or legislative activity may impact us or our institutions, nor can we predict the possible associated burdens and costs. Additional information regarding the regulatory and legislative environment and potential risks associated with it is available below and in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a voluntary, non-governmental process through which an institution or a program submits to review based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution or program. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations, and publicly recognize those institutions or programs that meet the stated criteria. Accredited institutions and programs are subject to periodic review to ensure institutional and program integrity, to encourage continued high performance and improvement, and to confirm that accreditation criteria continue to be satisfied. An institution or program that does not meet the criteria may have its accreditation limited, revoked, or not renewed.
Accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by ED is necessary to participate in Title IV and TA programs. To be recognized by ED, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures. The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, or NACIQI, is charged with advising ED on whether to recognize accrediting agencies. In 2016, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew ABHES’s recognition for five years and in February 2018, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew HLC’s recognition for five years. If one of our institutions’ institutional accreditors was to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency and the institution was unable to obtain recognition from another recognized accrediting agency, the institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and TA.
In October 2018, ED announced that it would establish a negotiated rulemaking committee broadly focused on accreditation and innovation, or the Accreditation and Innovation Committee, to prepare proposed regulations related to, among other things, ED’s recognition of accrediting agencies and related institutional eligibility issues. On November 1, 2019, ED published final regulations, portions of which relating to accreditation generally went into effect on July 1, 2020. The final regulations revise ED’s process for recognition and review of accrediting agencies and the criteria used by ED to recognize accrediting agencies. The regulations also revise ED’s requirements for oversight of accredited institutions and programs by generally providing accrediting agencies with greater autonomy and flexibility. 
Additional information about each of our institutions’ accreditation is provided above in each reporting segment’s “Our Institutions - Accreditation” section and as follows:
•APUS is institutionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, a regional accrediting agency recognized by ED. HLC accredits degree-granting institutions in a 19-state region, including West Virginia. HLC most recently reaffirmed the accreditation status of APUS in July 2011. The next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for the 2020-2021 academic year, with a related site visit scheduled to occur in April 2021. 
•Hondros College of Nursing, or HCN, is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools, or ABHES, a national accrediting agency recognized by ED. In June 2018, ABHES granted HCN initial institutional accreditation through February 28, 2021. (Prior to June 2018, HCN was accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS.) The comprehensive evaluation for renewal of ABHES accreditation, which would include HCN’s submission of evidence related to its compliance with ABHES standards and a series of site visits, was scheduled for April 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic and related disruptions. In August and September 2020, ABHES conducted virtual site visits to HCN’s campuses to assess compliance with ABHES accreditation standards. The visits resulted in findings that student satisfaction with the ADN and PN Programs at HCN’s Toledo campus and the PN program at HCN’s Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton campuses was below expected levels, which ABHES associated with the transition to online courses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a finding at the Indianapolis and Columbus campuses related to the composition of an advisory board. HCN has formally responded to each of the findings, and ABHES has taken no further action. In February 2021, ABHES granted HCN continued accreditation through February 2027 for all programs at all campuses. 
ABHES annually reviews student achievement indicators, including retention rate, placement rate, and licensing and credentialing examination pass rate. Under ABHES policy, ABHES may withdraw accreditation at any time if it 
determines that an institution fails to demonstrate at least a 70% retention rate for each program, a 70% placement rate for each program, and a 70% pass rate on mandatory licensing and credentialing examinations or fails to meet the state-mandated results for credentialing or licensure. Alternatively, ABHES may in its discretion provide an opportunity for a program to come into compliance within a period of time specified by ABHES, and ABHES may extend the period for achieving compliance if a program demonstrates improvement over time or other good cause. For the reporting year ended June 30, 2018, several HCN programs did not satisfy ABHES’s threshold requirements for retention rates or placement rates. For the reporting year ended June 30, 2019, each of HCN’s programs at each of HCN’s campuses satisfied ABHES’s placement rate requirements but failed to satisfy ABHES’s threshold requirements for retention rates.
In August 2019, ABHES notified HCN that ABHES had placed HCN’s Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo locations on outcomes reporting status, which requires submission of additional documentation regarding student outcomes and action plans for improving these outcomes. Based on the data submitted in response to ABHES’ request, ABHES determined that the PN Program at each of the Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo campuses did not satisfy ABHES’s retention rate requirement and that it was unable to verify that the ADN Program at each of the Cleveland and Toledo campuses had met ABHES’s placement rate requirement. ABHES directed HCN to submit certain documentation concerning the updated retention or placement rate, as applicable, for the reporting year ended June 30, 2019, and information about HCN’s action plan to achieve compliance if the updated rate was below 70%. HCN timely submitted the required documentation and action plans. ABHES notified HCN that the relevant programs at the Cleveland, Dayton, and Toledo campuses must come into compliance by May 1, 2020 and that the PN Program at the Columbus campus must come into compliance by May 1, 2021.
In February 2020, ABHES notified HCN that it had taken additional actions with respect to certain HCN programs at certain locations related to those programs’ performance in relation to ABHES student achievement indicators. Specifically, ABHES: (i) placed the PN programs at the Dayton and Toledo campuses on program specific warning status because the programs have failed to meet the 70% retention rate threshold since HCN’s 2017-2018 annual report and informed HCN that those programs must meet the retention rate threshold by May 1, 2020; (ii) removed the ADN programs at the Cleveland and Toledo campuses from outcomes reporting status after placement rates for those programs at those locations met the 70% compliance threshold; (iii) continued outcomes reporting status for the PN program at the Columbus campus because it has not met the retention rate compliance threshold and confirmed that it has until May 1, 2021 to do so; and (iv) directed HCN to provide evidence to ABHES that the ADN programs at each of the Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Toledo campuses and the PN programs at the Cleveland and Cincinnati campuses met the retention rate compliance threshold for the period from July 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020, and informed HCN that those programs must meet the compliance threshold by May 1, 2021. On April 22, 2020, HCN notified ABHES that, as of March 31, 2020, HCN met the 70% retention rate threshold at each campus location. For the reporting year July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, HCN’s programs satisfied ABHES’s threshold requirements for retention rate, placement rate, and mandatory licensure and credentialing examination pass rates. There can be no assurance that HCN will be able to continue to demonstrate compliance in all cases. If HCN fails to meet the student achievement indicators and is unable to maintain compliance during any timeframe established by ABHES, unless such timeframe is extended for good cause, ABHES may take other action, up to and including withdrawing accreditation for those programs. 
On August 12, 2020, ABHES requested that HCN provide ABHES with a financial improvement plan that details HCN’s financial objectives, outlines HCN’s financial improvement plans, including a specific timeline, and addresses the net loss for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The plan was timely submitted to ABHES. ABHES has taken no additional action regarding this matter since the plan was submitted.
Adverse actions taken by ABHES may trigger reporting requirements and ED action under ED’s Borrower Defense Regulations. See “Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Borrower Defenses.”
Institutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend in part on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Students and sponsors of tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for quality assurance, and employers rely on institutions’ accreditation status when evaluating a candidate’s credentials. In addition, the loss of institutional accreditation would result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and TA.
In addition to institutional accreditation, our institutions have obtained specialized accreditation or professional recognition for certain programs, as described more fully above in each reporting segment’s section under “Our Institutions” 
entitled “Accreditation.” If one of our institutions fails to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies or professional organizations, the relevant programs could lose the specialized accreditation or professional recognition, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs, prevent the institution from offering the programs in certain states where programmatic accreditation is required, or prevent our students from seeking and obtaining licensure or employment.
State Licensure/Authorization 
Our institutions are subject to regulation by the states in which they operate. The level of oversight varies from state to state, and such regulations change frequently. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, faculty qualifications, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe regulations related to an institution’s financial condition, and some states require the posting of surety bonds. State laws and regulations may affect our institutions’ ability to offer educational programs, open locations, and award degrees. If one of our institutions fails to comply with a state’s requirements, it may lose its state licensure or authorization, which would result in the institution’s inability to enroll students in that state and could result in the institution’s inability to receive Title IV program funds and TA funds, at least for students in that state.
Some states assert authority to regulate an institution if its educational programs are offered to residents of those states, regardless of whether the institution maintains a physical presence in the state. The growth of online education has led and may further lead to new laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. New laws, regulations, or interpretations could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could negatively affect enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in our business activities could lead states that do not currently require our institutions to be authorized to require such authorization. The extent of this increase in regulatory obligations, and the associated costs and significance, are not known at this time. Furthermore, in some states it may take a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative, or we may not be able to do so at all.
The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, is a voluntary agreement among member states, districts, and territories that establishes national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education and is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by institutions based in another jurisdiction. SARA requires member jurisdictions to approve institutions in their jurisdiction to participate in SARA, based upon institutional accreditation and financial stability, and to resolve student complaints. Applications must be renewed annually. SARA does not cover, or limits its coverage related to, certain activities. As a result, an institution may still be required to obtain state authorization from, for example, agencies, or boards responsible for professional licensure. We cannot predict the extent to which states will retain membership in SARA, the manner in which SARA’s rules may be modified, interpreted and enforced, our institutions’ ability to comply with SARA’s requirements and retain eligibility, or the impact that failure to meet the SARA requirements may have on our business. For information on our institutions’ status under SARA, see “—State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions” below.
Many states also have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in a specified field. Students’ success in obtaining licensure typically depends on several factors, including: individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and the accreditation of the institution and the specific program. 
Federal Requirements for State Licensure/Authorization
“Home” State Authorization
ED regulations specify how an institution may demonstrate, as required by ED, that it is authorized to offer postsecondary educational programs by the state(s) where it is located, which we refer to as its “home” state, and that the home state otherwise satisfies ED requirements. If ED determines that an institution does not have the required state approval, the institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs. If one of our institutions were to lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs in connection with “home” state authorization requirements, it would also lose its ability to participate in TA. 
The loss of ability of one of our institutions to participate in either Title IV programs or TA could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
State Authorization of Online Education
In December 2016, ED published final regulations addressing, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education, which were scheduled to go into effect in July 2018. In June 2018, ED announced that it would delay the effective date of the distance education portion of the state authorization final regulations, or the Distance Education Rule, until July 1, 2020. In April 2019, a U.S. District Court judge found that the delayed implementation was improper, and as a result of the court’s related order, the Distance Education Rule took effect in May 2019. The Distance Education Rule requires an institution offering distance education programs to be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, in order to award Title IV aid to such students. An institution may obtain such authorization directly from the state or through a state authorization reciprocity agreement that satisfies ED’s definition of such an agreement. In addition, the Distance Education Rule requires an institution to document the state process for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education and to provide certain public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs that are provided or can be completed solely through distance education or correspondence courses, excluding internships and practicums. 

In October 2018, ED announced the Accreditation and Innovation Committee would prepare proposed regulations related to, among other things, institutional and programmatic eligibility issues, including state authorization and courses offered through distance education. In June 2019, ED published certain portions of the agreed-upon regulatory language, including those provisions related to state authorization, in a notice of proposed rulemaking. On November 1, 2019, ED published final regulations concerning state authorization, which went into effect on July 1, 2020, except that institutions may in their discretion implement early regulations relating to state authorization and institutional information disclosures. APUS implemented early those regulations effective November 1, 2019. The final regulations related to state authorization effectively replace the Distance Education Rule. The final regulations also clarify the required methodology for determining the state in which a student is located for purposes of satisfying state authorization requirements for distance education courses and require an institution to disclose certain information related to whether programs leading to professional licensure meet applicable state requirements, regardless of program modality. 
State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions
APUS is authorized to enroll students from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. APUS is headquartered in Charles Town, West Virginia, with administrative offices in Virginia that will be vacated at the end of June 2021. APUS is authorized to offer its programs by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, or WVHEPC. Under current law, if APUS were to lose its accreditation by HLC, WVHEPC may suspend, withdraw, or revoke APUS’s authorization. Failure to comply with WVHEPC requirements could result in APUS losing its authorization from WVHEPC, its accreditation by HLC, its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and TA, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which could force APUS to cease operations. Under Virginia law, because it currently has administrative offices in Virginia, APUS is required to be authorized by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, or SCHEV. Accordingly, APUS has obtained SCHEV’s authorization to operate as an out-of-state institution. APUS has participated in SARA since its application was approved in December 2014. APUS also has obtained authorization to operate in California, which is the only state that is a non-SARA jurisdiction. 
HCN is headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, and has five campuses in Ohio. In April 2020, HCN began classes for the first cohort of students enrolled in the PN Program at HCN’s new campus in Indianapolis, Indiana, and in April 2021, HCN will begin offering classes at a new campus in Akron, Ohio. HCN is authorized to offer instruction in Ohio by the Ohio State Board. HCN’s PN and ADN programs are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing, or OBN. HCN has been authorized by the Indiana Board for Proprietary Education/Indiana Commission for Higher Education to offer instruction at the campus in Indiana. The Indiana State Board of Nursing has granted initial accreditation and authorized the admission of the first cohort of students. HCN first began to participate in SARA in April 2016. Its SARA approval lapsed in April 2020 and was renewed in August 2020. 
To apply for licensure to practice nursing in Ohio, an applicant must have successfully completed a nursing education program approved by the OBN. The OBN requires that nursing education programs such as HCN’s PN and ADN Programs have a pass rate on the relevant National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX, that is at least 95% of the national average for first-time candidates in a calendar year. If a program does not attain this pass rate, the program may face various consequences, including placement of a program on provisional status or withdrawal of approval pursuant to an adjudication proceeding. In March 2017, the OBN placed HCN’s ADN Program on provisional approval because the ADN Program had not met the pass rate standard for four consecutive years. In March 2020, the OBN found that HCN’s ADN Program did not meet the OBN pass rate standard in 2019 for a seventh consecutive year, and we do not expect to meet the pass rate standard in 2020. The OBN will consider restoring a program to Full Approval status if the program meets the pass rate standard for at least two 
consecutive years. If a program on provisional approval fails to meet OBN requirements at the end of the time period established for provisional approval, the OBN may propose to continue provisional approval for a set time period or may propose to withdraw approval. HCN has been implementing changes, including curriculum, admissions, and academic achievement and course retake policy changes, that are designed to improve NCLEX scores over time, but there is no assurance that these changes will be successful or will not have negative effects on HCN’s enrollment. For example, enrollments in HCN’s ADN Program in 2019 were significantly lower than HCN planned, which we believe was likely partly associated with the implementation of new academic achievement and admissions requirements that had the effect of reducing enrollments from qualified students. If HCN is unable to improve NCLEX scores over time, this situation could have an adverse impact on our ability to enroll students and eventually our ability to continue HCN’s ADN Program, any of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. The Indiana State Board of Nursing also requires that nursing education programs have a pass rate on the relevant NCLEX exam that satisfies certain requirements. A program that is under initial accreditation may not be granted full accreditation if the program’s pass rate is lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate. In addition, if the program’s pass rate is lower than one standard deviation below the average national pass rate for three consecutive years, the program may be subject to additional oversight or a change in accreditation status. 
Failure to comply with state authorization or licensure requirements could restrict our institutions’ ability to recruit or enroll students or result in other sanctions, including fines and penalties. We review state requirements to determine whether our institutions’ activities in those states may constitute a physical presence or otherwise may require authorization or licensure. New laws, regulations, interpretations, or changed circumstances related to our institutions’ educational programs could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students and offer programs in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements
Our students finance their education through a combination of Title IV programs, TA, education benefits administered by the VA, private loans, corporate reimbursement programs, individual resources and, in the case of HCN, institutional grants and an extended payment plan option. Participation in federal student aid programs, including those administered by DoD and VA, and the extended payment plan option at HCN, adds to the regulation of our operations. In particular, the HEA and related ED regulations subject us to significant scrutiny in the form of numerous standards we must satisfy in order to participate in and administer Title IV programs.
Department of Education
The federal government provides support for postsecondary education through the Title IV programs in the form of grants and loans to eligible students who can use those funds to enroll in an eligible educational program at any institution that has been certified by ED. An institution will be certified to participate in the Title IV programs only if, among other things, it enters into a written program participation agreement, or PPA, with ED, which conditions participation in Title IV programs upon compliance with ED regulations and any additional conditions specified in the PPA.
Types of Title IV Financial Aid Programs.
Title IV program aid is primarily awarded to students on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending an institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute. Our students receive grants and loans to fund their education under several Title IV programs, of which the two largest are Direct Loans and Pell Grants. Direct Loan Program loans, including Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans, and Federal Consolidation Loans, are made directly by the federal government to students or their parents. Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. In accordance with applicable appropriations legislation, the maximum Pell Grant is $6,345 for the 2020-2021 award year and $6,495 for the 2021-2022 award year. A student’s lifetime eligibility to receive a Pell Grant is 12 semesters (or its equivalent). Students may not be able to use all of this eligibility at our institutions based on their prior receipt of Pell Grants at other institutions. Institutions may award Pell Grant funds for up to 150% of a student’s standard scheduled Pell Grant in one award year. This provision, which commonly is referred to as “year-round Pell,” is intended to allow students to graduate more quickly and with less debt. Some of our students may also be eligible for other Title IV grant programs, such as the Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant. The Title IV programs are subject to Congressional action in terms of appropriations and other legislation that may affect funding levels, student eligibility, and other requirements. For example, the Pell Grant program could be subject to cuts or changes in the future, and cuts in ED’s administrative budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in origination and processing of federal student loans.
Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs
To be eligible and certified to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must be authorized to operate by the appropriate regulatory authority in each state where the institution maintains a physical presence, and must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED. 
ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing institutional compliance with certain Title IV program requirements. For these reasons, we cannot predict with certainty how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. Key provisions relating to institutional participation in Title IV and the processing of Title IV aid that could adversely affect us include the following:
Eligibility and Certification Procedures. An institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.
ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if ED finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all Title IV requirements and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control. During a period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions imposed by ED. In addition, ED may more closely review a provisionally-certified institution if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. If ED determines that a provisionally-certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities, it may seek to revoke the institution’s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections than if it were fully-certified. 
In June 2020, APUS timely applied for recertification to participate in Title IV programs. On September 9, 2020, ED notified APUS that it had completed its review of APUS’s application and had granted APUS provisional certification until June 30, 2023. ED issued APUS a provisional program participation agreement, or PPPA, outlining the terms of provisional certification. As described in the PPPA, the reason ED granted approval on a provisional basis is because APUS was subject to an open program review at the time of renewal. As discussed more fully in “Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations - Compliance Reviews,” in September 2016 ED began a program review of APUS’s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years, and that program review was closed on January 27, 2021 with no findings and no further action required. HCN was provisionally certified to participate in the Title IV programs from November 2013 until September 2018. Since September 2018, HCN has been certified to participate in Title IV programs, without the restrictions of provisional certification. HCN will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after September 30, 2021. 
State Authorization. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies. As described more fully above in “State Licensure/Authorization,” ED has specified the types of state approvals that are acceptable to demonstrate that an institution is authorized to offer postsecondary educational programs, and ED has promulgated rules that address authorization by states in which students enrolled in distance education programs reside or are located.
Administrative Capability. ED regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite “administrative capability” to participate in Title IV programs, including that the institution must:
•comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations;
•have capable and sufficient personnel to administer Title IV programs;
•have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;
•not have cohort default rates above specified levels;
•have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;
•not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;
•provide financial aid counseling to its students;
•refer to ED’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;
•submit in a timely manner all required reports and financial statements;
•develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepant information with respect to a student’s application for Title IV aid; and
•not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.
If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution’s participation in Title IV programs.
Financial Responsibility. The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including making required refunds and any repayments to ED.
ED evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards, including a complex formula based on line items from the institution’s audited financial statements. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution’s capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution’s viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution’s profitability or ability to operate within its means). Generally, an institution’s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible. Under certain circumstances, an institution may be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis by complying with various conditions.
ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to other entities under common ownership with an eligible institution. At the request of ED, for purposes of evaluating the financial responsibility of our institutions, including the composite score calculation, we supply consolidated financial statements to ED.
In September 2019, ED published new final regulations, which we refer to as the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations, which among other things amend ED’s financial responsibility provisions in several respects. ED previously modified financial responsibility standards in regulations published in November 2016, which we refer to as the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, to provide that an institution (other than a public institution) may not be able to meet its financial or administrative obligations, and is therefore not financially responsible, if it is subject to one or more triggering events. The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations identify certain conditions or other triggering events that have or may have an adverse material effect on the institution’s financial condition, in response to which ED would or could require that the institution submit some form of financial protection, such as a letter of credit, to ED. Under the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations, ED will consider an institution unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations under ED’s financial responsibility regulations if the institution is subject to one of certain mandatory triggering events that ED believes have or are likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution. ED may consider an institution not to be financially responsible if ED determines that one of certain discretionary triggering events is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution. If the institution is subject to two or more of these discretionary triggering events, ED will consider the institution to be subject to a mandatory triggering event and therefore unable to meet its financial or administrative obligations. For each triggering event, to demonstrate that the institution remains financially responsible, the institution may submit evidence that the triggering event has been resolved, that the institution has insurance that will cover part or all of the debt or liabilities, or that the triggering event has not or will not have a material adverse effect on the institution. If ED determines that one of our institutions is not financially responsible because of one or more triggering events, the institution would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit equal to at least 10% of the amount of federal student financial aid funds received by the institution for the past year.
The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations also implement updates to ED’s calculations of an institution’s composite score to reflect certain changes in Financial Accounting Standards Board accounting standards and to update the definitions and terms used to describe the calculation of the composite score, including leases and long-term debt. The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations took effect on July 1, 2020.
Failure of one of our institutions to meet the “financial responsibility” requirements, because it does not satisfy the minimum composite score or is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, or because it fails to meet other financial responsibility requirements, could cause the institution to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation. ED’s determination that our consolidated financial statements do not satisfy the “financial responsibility” requirements could cause both APUS and HCN to lose access to Title IV program funding or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation.
The “90/10 Rule.” Under the so-called “90/10 Rule”, a for-profit institution is prohibited from deriving more than 90% of its revenue (as computed by ED) on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) from Title IV programs for any fiscal year. If an institution violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year, the institution is placed on provisional status for two fiscal years. An institution that violates the rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and is required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two additional fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. 
Using the applicable 90/10 formula, the following table contains the percentage of cash-basis revenue earned from Title IV program funds:

 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020
APUS | 41% | 38% | 35% 
HCN | 82% | 80% | 82% 

    In recent years, Congress has considered various proposals that would modify the 90/10 Rule. In February and March 2021, the House and Senate each passed versions of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which each include a provision that amends the 90/10 Rule to count all federal education assistance towards the “90%” portion of the calculation. The bill requires additional Congressional approval and Presidential signature prior to enactment. If the bill is enacted in the form passed by the Senate, the revised 90/10 Rule would be subject to negotiated rulemaking, and we expect the Department of Education to seek in that process to define federal education assistance to include TA and VA education benefits. Under the bill, the revised 90/10 Rule would go into effect no earlier than July 1, 2023. At this time we cannot predict whether Congress will pass additional legislation to modify the 90/10 Rule, and what sources of funds could be counted toward the limit. For example, some recent proposals have focused on decreasing the limit on Title IV funds from 90% to 85% but not changing the funds that count toward that limit, others have proposed maintaining the 90% limit but counting TA and VA education benefits toward that limit, and others would both decrease the limit on Title IV funds to 85% and count all federal education assistance funds toward that limit. Such proposals, or other similar legislation, should they become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions.
Incentive Payment Rule. An institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or federal student financial aid. In June 2015, ED announced that it will calculate institutional liability for noncompliance with the incentive payment rule by calculating the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive payment rule. ED may also fine an institution, or take administrative action to limit, suspend, revoke, deny, or terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, if the institution violates the prohibition. 
We have designed our employee compensation and third-party contractual arrangements to comply with the incentive payment rule currently in effect. However, because there are ambiguities as to how the rule is interpreted and enforced by ED and because we could make errors in implementation, we can make no assurances that ED would not find deficiencies in our past, current, or future employee compensation plans and relevant third-party contractual arrangements. In addition, in recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants in whistleblower lawsuits, known as “qui tam” cases, brought pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that an institution’s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive payment rule. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management’s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.
Gainful Employment. Under the HEA, for-profit schools are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in connection with educational programs that lead to “gainful employment in a recognized occupation,” except for certain programs leading to a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts. Historically, this concept had not been defined in detail.
Regulations relating to gainful employment, which we refer to as the GE Regulations, went into effect in July 2015, with the exception of certain disclosure requirements, which generally went into effect in January 2017. The GE Regulations, among other things, established debt-related measures for determining whether certain postsecondary education programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation, required institutions to make certain disclosures in connection with gainful employment programs, and required institutions to make certain certifications to ED concerning gainful employment programs. On July 1, 2019, ED rescinded the GE Regulations, effective July 1, 2020, but elective early implementation of the rescission was permitted. Institutions that implemented the rescission early were not required to report 
data related to gainful employment programs to ED, comply with gainful employment disclosure requirements, or comply with related certification requirements, among other requirements. APUS and HCN elected to implement early the rescission of the GE Regulations. APUS continues to voluntarily make certain disclosures related to gainful employment programs.
Student Loan Defaults. Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of federal loans by its students exceed 40% in any one year or 30% for each of three consecutive years. An institution’s cohort default rate is calculated as the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment in the relevant fiscal year who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. If an institution’s cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30%, it must establish a default prevention task force.
In September 2020, ED released official three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2017. The final official ED cohort default rates for APUS and HCN for the federal fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 are as follows:

 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 
APUS | 23.8% | 18.5% | 15.2%
HCN | 11.4% | 11.3% | 12.1%

If one or both of our institutions has a default rate in excess of allowable levels, it could result in that institution’s or those institutions’ loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or incurring additional costs related to default prevention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a result of the CARES Act and subsequent administrative actions, ED implemented a temporary freeze on payments and interest accruals for federal student loans. This administrative forbearance period began on March 20, 2020 and will run until at least September 30, 2021. During this period of temporary relief, we would expect borrowers to be substantially less likely to default on federal student loans, which may artificially lower our institutions’ cohort default rates for federal fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Upon expiration of the temporary freeze, borrowers will again need to make repayments on loans and loans will again accrue interest, which may lead to higher cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2020 compared to federal fiscal years that reflect the effects of the temporary freeze on payments and interest accruals. See “Company Overview - COVID-19 Pandemic.”
Privacy of Student Personal Information and Records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, and ED’s regulations implementing FERPA require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students’ educational records by, among other things, limiting disclosure of a student’s personally identifiable information without prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, educational institutions engaged in financial activities such as the granting of student loans are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and applicable GLBA regulations, which among other things, require a comprehensive, written information security program to protect personally identifiable financial information of students, parents, or other individuals in a customer relationship with the institution. Failure to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements may result in Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforcement, which could include the imposition of conditions, penalties, monitoring, and oversight. Institutions are also subject to the general deceptive and unfair practices jurisdiction of Section 5 of the FTC Act with respect to their collection, use, protection, and disclosure of student information. The FTC has brought numerous enforcement actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) may have collected, used, shared, or retained personal information inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) may have had privacy policies that did not adequately inform consumers about actual practices; and (3) may have failed to reasonably protect the security, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information. Institutions must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a requirement designed to identify and mitigate identity theft for certain student accounts. States also have so called “mini-FTC Acts” under which they may bring enforcement actions similar to those of the FTC as well as other applicable privacy and security laws. For example, a new law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which took effect in January 2020 and for which regulations were issued later in 2020, imposes new disclosure obligations and contains a broad array of consumer rights relating to their personal information, including among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand the deletion of personal information. The CCPA also creates new consumer notice obligations. The CCPA has the potential for significant civil penalties for failing to comply as well as a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches that are the result of unreasonable security, which may increase data breach litigation, including class action litigation. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act, which will expand the CCPA’s requirements when it becomes effective in 2023. In addition, our collection of personal information relating to students or other individuals who are in the European Union, or EU, may implicate the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR contains numerous requirements 
relating to the collection, possession, use, and disclosure of personal information, but enforcement priorities and interpretation of certain provisions remain unclear. The GDPR requirements are generally stricter and more comprehensive than those of the U.S. Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a fine for certain activities of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of an organization’s global annual revenue, whichever is higher, per violation. 
Accessibility for Students with Disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or Section 504, prohibits discrimination against a person with a disability by any organization that receives federal financial assistance, which includes us. In 2010, ED’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Section 504, together with the Department of Justice, asserted that requiring the use of technology in a classroom environment when such technology is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities violates Section 504, unless those individuals are provided accommodations or modifications that permit them to receive all the educational benefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and integrated manner. In recent years, ED’s Office for Civil Rights has taken enforcement action against several institutions of higher education, including primarily online institutions, after determining that their websites and online learning management platforms were not accessible to persons with a disability. If one of our institutions is found to have violated Section 504, it may be required to modify existing content and functionality of its online classroom or other uses of technology, including through adoption of specific technical standards. An institution that does not come into compliance with Section 504 could lose access to federal funding, including the ability to participate in the Title IV programs and TA. 
College Affordability and Transparency Lists. ED publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of nine categories, with (i) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (ii) the highest “net price” for the most recent academic year, (iii) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (iv) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to ED explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. ED reports annually to Congress on these institutions and publishes its reports on its website. ED also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. APUS was listed as the private for-profit, four-year or more undergraduate institution with the 13th lowest tuition for 2018-2019, and 14th lowest tuition for 2017-2018, in each case the most recent years for which data is available. We cannot determine the extent to which such lists have impacted or may impact our enrollments, reputation, or operating results.
College Scorecard. In September 2015, ED publicly released its “College Scorecard” website, which among other characteristics, allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. Certain College Scorecard measures are based on data collected only about students who receive Title IV program aid. While a significant portion of APUS students receive Title IV program aid, they are a minority of APUS’s students. In August 2018, ED announced a plan to update the College Scorecard or a similar web-based tool to provide program-level outcomes for all higher education programs at all institutions that participate in the Title IV Programs. In 2019, ED updated the College Scorecard to include additional information, including more comprehensive graduation rates and program-level outcomes data such as median earnings and median loan debt. In December 2020, ED further updated the College Scorecard to include data on average earnings two years out from graduation based on field of study and data on student loan repayment. We cannot determine the extent to which the data collected and published by ED has impacted or may impact our enrollments, reputation, or operating results.
Third-Party Servicers. ED regulations permit an institution to enter into a contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the Title IV programs. Our institutions utilize third-party servicers for some services and in the future may consider using third-party servicers for other functions that are currently managed directly by our institutions. Third-party servicers must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to ED for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to ED new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers and other matters related to third-party servicers. If any third-party servicer engaged by one of our institutions does not comply with applicable statute and regulations, our institution may be liable for its actions, and our institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.
Title IV Return of Funds. When a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned Title IV program funds to ED in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of funds that a student “earned” before withdrawal. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV program funds or (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program 
funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institution’s determination that a student withdrew.
If 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of ED equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. For example, APUS’s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2016 identified a finding related to return of Title IV funds calculations that were not properly computed. In a Final Audit Determination letter in January 2018, ED conveyed its finding that funds had not been returned timely. ED also noted that a similar finding had been made in a program review that ED subsequently closed. In connection with the finding, ED required that APUS post an irrevocable letter of credit for approximately $700,000. APUS posted the letter of credit in March 2018 and it expired December 31, 2019. If ED determines that one of our institutions has repeatedly failed to comply with ED regulations, it may take adverse action against the institution on the basis of the repeated finding or may find that the institution has failed to demonstrate administrative capability, as described above.
Misrepresentation. Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, ED may fine, suspend or terminate the participation in Title IV programs by an institution that engages in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. 
The Clery Act. Our institutions are required to comply with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires an institution, among other things, to report to ED and disclose in an annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred on or within the institution’s so-called “Clery geography” and to publish certain policies and procedures related to campus safety. A failure to comply with the Clery Act could result in our institutions being fined or having their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, could lead to litigation, or could harm our institutions’ reputation, each of which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions’ enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business.
Borrower Defenses. Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. ED’s previous regulations permitted a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. In November 2016, ED published the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, which concern which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a student borrower or group of borrowers may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program and certain other matters. For Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations created a new federal standard for borrower defenses to repayment of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. The 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations also prohibited institutions from requiring students to engage in the institutions’ internal complaint processes before contacting other agencies, prohibited the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements by institutions, prohibit class action lawsuit waivers, and required institutions to notify ED of arbitration filings and awards, for claims that may form the basis for a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan. The implementation of certain portions of the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, including portions of the regulations establishing a new federal standard and a process for determining whether a Direct Loan borrower has a defense to repayment on a Direct Loan based on an act or omission of an institution, was delayed by ED and those provisions went into effect pursuant to a court order in October 2018. The 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations remained in effect until the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations, described below, which went into effect on July 1, 2020 and will thereafter continue to apply to all loans made under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2017 and before July 1, 2020, with certain exceptions pursuant to the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations.
On September 23, 2019, ED published the 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations, which, among other things, modify the borrower defenses to repayment for loans made under the Direct Loan Program on or after July 1, 2020, the limitation periods for related claims, and the processes for resolution of such claims as compared to defenses and claims under the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations. The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations generally remove the prohibitions contained in the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations, but require institutions whose students must enter into pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers as a condition of enrollment to disclose publicly those requirements in an easily accessible format, and prohibit such institutions from requiring a student to participate in arbitration or any internal dispute resolution process prior to filing a borrower defense to repayment application with ED. ED will have discretion to determine the appropriate amount of relief, if any. The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations eliminate the process available under the 2016 Borrower Defense Regulations for a group of borrowers for Direct Loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2020.

Under the Borrower Defense Regulations, ED may also initiate a separate proceeding to collect from an institution the amount of relief resulting from a borrower defense brought by an individual borrower. If ED determines that borrowers of 
Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Direct Loans, our repayment liability to ED could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
The 2020 Borrower Defense Regulations also made other regulatory changes, including modifying ED’s requirements with respect to the circumstances under which a borrower is eligible for a loan discharge if an institution or location closes. 
Department of Defense
Service members of the U.S. Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the uniform tuition assistance program of the DoD, or TA. Service members may use TA to pursue postsecondary degrees at institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by ED. APUS participates in TA, and for students in APUS undergraduate, and beginning January 2020, for students in APUS master’s programs, we have established tuition rates per credit hour that under current DoD policies can be 100% covered by DoD tuition assistance funds provided that the student does not exceed the annual limits per student. As of November 2019, HCN also participates in TA.
In March 2013, DoD restricted the ability of service members who have not previously taken a postsecondary education course and who are in certain duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive TA for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have contracts with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin their first postsecondary education program after arrival at an applicable overseas location may not use TA to pay for their education in our programs until after they have already successfully completed a course with an institution that has entered into a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas location may continue to receive TA for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location.
DoD has issued briefings that prohibit base commanders from authorizing education institutions to hold regular or recurring office hours on installations solely to provide counseling and prohibit former military members from accessing installations to represent an educational institution using their government ID card privileges. This has adversely affected our efforts to support existing students and serve new students. If we are not able to improve our access to military installations and our existing students on those installations, or find alternative methods to serve those students, our military enrollments may decline.
Each institution participating in TA is required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to being permitted to participate in TA. In May 2014, DoD promulgated new regulations and a revised MOU, or the DoD MOU, which APUS signed in August 2014 and which HCN signed in November 2019. Pursuant to the DoD MOU, among other requirements, institutions must: explain certain tools to service members, such as ED’s “College Navigator” website and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s “Paying for College” website; comply with requirements related to readmission policies for service members; abide by limitations on the use of funds derived from TA; provide certain academic and student support services; disclose information about transfer of credit; in certain circumstances, return TA funds to DoD (such as when a student ceases to attend or an institution cancels a course); offer to service members loan counseling before private student loans are offered or recommended; and comply with ED’s Title IV “program integrity” rules, including rules related to incentive payments and misrepresentation. The DoD MOU also provides that an institution may only participate in TA if it is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, approved for VA funding, and a participant in Title IV programs. Additional information regarding the potential risks associated with the DoD MOU is provided in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.
In January 2014, several federal government agencies announced an online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, or Post-9/11 GI Bill, TA, and other military-related education benefit programs. An institution having recurring substantive complaints, or demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve complaints, may face a range of penalties, including revocation of its MOU and removal from participation in TA.
In addition to TA, branches of the U.S. military offer credentialing assistance, which links soldiers to and in many cases provides funds for approved training courses or exams related to occupational licenses or certifications, and associated books, supplies and materials. Credentialing Opportunities Online, or COOL, is a program for each of the military branches and DoD civilians that links experience with certification. While benefits vary by service, service members may be eligible for assistance in paying for certifications, including by vouchers, reimbursement, or grants. Students must meet certain eligibility 
requirements in order to receive credentialing assistance, including in some cases service time, experience and TA eligibility requirements. The Army offers an expanded credentialing program called the Army Credentialing Assistance Program, or CA. CA is a program designed to support soldiers who wish to pursue civilian credentials, licenses, and certifications that lead directly to a specific job, including in areas outside of a soldier’s Military Occupational Specialty (MOS). Through CA, soldiers can receive reimbursement for fees associated with qualifying programs listed on Army COOL. APUS became an approved training provider for CA programs in October 2019 while CA was in an expanded user test, and Army-wide implementation of CA began in January 2020. We believe other service branches may follow the Army’s example or pursue other approaches to enhancing support for credentialing. Students in the Army may use both TA and credentialing assistance for CA, subject to a combined cap on benefit amounts.
Department of Veterans Affairs
The VA administers education benefits provided by federal law, including the Montgomery GI Bill, or GI Bill, and the Post-9/11 GI Bill. APUS is approved to provide education to veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in West Virginia and Virginia. Programs at each of HCN’s campuses in Ohio are approved for VA benefits by the state approving agency in Ohio. 
Under current law, for the 2020-2021 academic year, an eligible veteran who attends a non-public U.S. institution may receive veterans’ education benefits to pay for tuition and fees based on the net cost to the veteran up to $25,162.14. Veterans pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive a monthly housing allowance equal to 50% of the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents, or $916.50 per month.
To the extent that TA does not cover the full cost of tuition for service members, eligible service members may also use their benefits under the GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill through the “Top-Up” program. The “Top-Up” program allows U.S. Military active duty service members to use their GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of TA that is paid by the military for the course, but is limited to 36 months of payments.
On January 5, 2021, the President signed into law the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, which modified policies related to GI Bill and other VA-administered education funds. The new law requires institutions to be financially responsible for all benefits paid directly to institutions in instances of overpayments that need to be returned to the VA. Prior to this change, institutions were only responsible for some benefits while students were responsible for the remainder. This legislation also includes requirements related to consumer disclosures, advertisements, and recruiting that align with the requirements institutions must follow in order to receive funds under ED and DOD programs. These requirements include the provision of disclosures about cost, loan debt, graduation rates, job placement rates, and transfer credit policies; the prohibition of incentive compensation on the basis of securing enrollments; the prohibition of high-pressure recruitment tactics like numerous unsolicited contacts and same-day recruitment and registration. The majority of these requirements go into effect on August 1, 2021.
Additional Sources of Student Payments
In addition to the Title IV, DoD, and VA programs described above, eligible students may participate in other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources. Some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial employer tuition reimbursement. Our institutions enter into agreements with various employers through which our institutions agree to a variety of terms, including terms related to the provision of tuition grants to eligible employees. Our institutions may offer interest free payment plans of less than 12 months to students to assist them with the financing of educational expenses. In certain circumstances, our students may access alternative loan programs from a number of private lenders, which are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and the student’s total cost of attendance. As part of an institution’s Title IV PPA, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans, including alternative loans.
Beginning in July 2018, HCN began offering its students an extended payment plan option. The extended payment plan is designed to assist students with educational costs consisting of tuition, textbooks, and fees, and are only available after all other student financial assistance has been applied. Payment plans require monthly payments while the student is enrolled in a program and extend for up to six months after the last day of attendance or graduation. To the extent interest is applied, it is generally fixed and does not accrue until the student departs the program or graduates. The extended payment plan does not 
impose any origination fees. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the extended payment plan and counseled to use all federal funding options. The extended payment plan is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, such as the Truth in Lending Act as implemented in Regulation Z, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as implemented in Regulation B and the Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Beginning January 1, 2020, HCN began offering an institutional affordability grant to students demonstrating financial need to cover the difference between the total cost of tuition and fees less the amount of all eligible financial aid resources. The grant is designed to limit a student’s monthly payment to $200 through an award of up to $200 per month, or $600 per term after consideration of financial aid, employer tuition reimbursement, and other financial resources. 
Consumer Protection
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has pursued enforcement actions against certain for-profit institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. In October 2020, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released a report analyzing more than 1,900 complaints from private student loan borrowers and more than 5,000 federal student loan servicing complaints the CFPB received between September 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020. We do not know what enforcement actions the CFPB may pursue, or what steps Congress or federal agencies may take, in response to these reports and whether such actions, if any, will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints
Many states have become more active in regulating for-profit education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically related to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. For example, the Attorney General of Massachusetts issued APUS a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID, in July 2017 relating to an investigation of alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices by AMU in connection with the recruitment and retention of students and the financing of education. The CID required the production of documents and information relating to recruitment, enrollment, job placement and other matters. In August 2018, APUS entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance, or AOD, to resolve the inquiry. Pursuant to the terms of the AOD, and without any finding or admission of wrongdoing on APUS’s part, APUS paid $270,000 to the Attorney General and agreed to otherwise comply with applicable Massachusetts regulations. Other state attorneys general may also initiate inquiries into us or our subsidiaries. Actions by state attorneys general and other governmental agencies, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions’ programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.
Our institutions are recipients of complaints filed with state regulatory authorities, the Better Business Bureau, and posted in online forums. Our institutions attempt to resolve such complaints in a cooperative manner. However, even if such complaints are resolved or are otherwise unfounded, they may still harm the reputation of our institutions. For example, in August 2017, HCN received notice from the Ohio State Board that the Ohio State Board was responding to student complaints and initiating formal disciplinary action against HCN’s Cincinnati campus because the campus discontinued offering one version of the PN Program curriculum and implemented a new PN Program curriculum allegedly without the Ohio State Board’s permission. It was alleged that at least three students enrolled in the discontinued curriculum were unable to complete without transferring into the new program and incurring substantial costs and time to complete the program. HCN submitted a proposed resolution to the Ohio State Board, which included for each of the three students a partial refund for classes in which they enrolled but earned no credit. The Ohio State Board accepted HCN’s proposal. One student accepted the partial refund, and the two others failed to return executed agreements to the Ohio State Board by their due dates. In January 2018, the Ohio State Board informed those two students that it had closed their cases.
Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations
Compliance Reviews
Our institutions are subject to compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, agencies that guarantee FFEL Program loans, DoD, VA, and accrediting agencies. The HEA and ED regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable ED Office of Inspector General audit standards. In addition, to enable ED to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations.
In September 2016, ED began a program review of APUS’s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years. As part of the program review, ED conducted a site visit in September 2016. In general, after ED conducts its site visit and reviews data supplied by the institution, if ED identifies any instances of noncompliance, ED sends the institution a preliminary program review report to which the institution has an opportunity to respond. ED then issues a final program review determination letter identifying any findings, including any liabilities. The institution may appeal any monetary liabilities specified in the final letter. On January 27, 2021, ED issued the final program review determination letter closing the review of APUS’s administration of the Title IV programs during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 award years. ED did not identify any findings, penalties, or requirements for further action, and the letter indicated that no further action was required with respect to findings in the 2016 Title IV compliance audit Final Audit Determination letter issued in January 2018, including a finding that return of Title IV funds calculations were incorrectly computed for some students and a finding that APUS had incorrectly reported the students’ enrollment status to the National Student Loan Data System for some students. ED closed the program review based on the length of time that had passed since the site visit, the continued monitoring of the institution through annual compliance audits, and APUS’s assertions that it has taken corrective actions. In June 2020, APUS timely applied for recertification to participate in Title IV programs. On September 9, 2020, ED notified APUS that it had completed its review of APUS’s application and had granted APUS provisional certification until June 30, 2023. ED issued APUS a PPPA outlining the terms of provisional certification. ED approved APUS on a provisional basis due to the open program review at the time of renewal. 
In order to participate in TA, institutions must agree to participate in DoD’s Voluntary Education Institutional Compliance Program, or ICP. An institution that through the ICP is found noncompliant with DoD requirements and demonstrates an unwillingness to resolve a finding may be subject to a range of penalties from a written warning to termination of the institution’s participation in TA. In February 2020, DoD informed APUS that it is one of 250 institutions selected for ICP review in 2020. Upon request, in May 2020, APUS submitted a self-assessment in connection with the ICP. On November 30, 2020, DoD issued a report finding that APUS did not clearly articulate certain policies or clearly make certain disclosures. APUS has submitted its corrective action plan and is required to submit related evidentiary support by May 31, 2021.
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations
If our institutions fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, ED could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring our institutions to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV program funds, requiring the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of ED as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against our institutions, referring the matter for criminal prosecution, or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate participation in Title IV programs. If APUS’s approval to participate in Title IV programs is terminated, APUS will also lose its ability to participate in TA pursuant to the DoD MOU. If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against our institutions and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of participation in Title IV programs, this would materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.
If one of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds were reduced, we could seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our institutions, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. We may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid.
In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our institutions’ participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public.
Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations
Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are subject to regulation from a variety of agencies. For example, ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements, and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to acquire or sell institutions, and to establish additional locations and programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. WVHEPC, SCHEV, HLC, ABHES, the Ohio State Board, and the Indiana Board for Proprietary Education/Indiana Commission for Higher Education generally require institutions to notify them, and sometimes require institutions to obtain their approval, in advance of opening a new location or implementing new programs.
Rasmussen Acquisition Regulatory Review
The Rasmussen Acquisition will be required to be reported to, and in some cases approved by, various education regulatory bodies. As discussed below, an institution must obtain ED approval for a change in ownership and control in order to continue to participate in Title IV programs under the new ownership. ED does not provide pre-closing approval but will conduct a “pre-acquisition review” of a proposed change at the request of the parties. The parties will request a pre-acquisition review of the Rasmussen Acquisition. Upon completion of a pre-acquisition review, ED will inform Rasmussen University whether it will be required to post a letter of credit in connection with its continued participation in Title IV programs after closing. As required, we intend to timely notify ED about the occurrence of the change in ownership of Rasmussen University and submit an application for approval to participate in Title IV programs after the closing of the transaction.
We will also notify state agencies, accreditors, boards of nursing, and other relevant regulators of this change in ownership to the extent required. In some instances, these bodies will require prior approval before the change in ownership can be completed. For example, as discussed below, HLC requires approval before the closing of a transaction in order for an institution to maintain accredited status after closing. The parties have submitted an application to HLC for pre-closing approval of the change in ownership. Additionally, some regulators will require approval after the change in ownership in order to continue proper licensure, accreditation, approval, or authorization.
Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control
ED’s regulations, state regulatory requirements, and accreditation standards may limit our ability to acquire, merge, or sell institutions, and may impose restrictions on activities following a transaction. For example, ED must approve any change in ownership resulting in a change of control. These restrictions may impede our ability to grow by acquisition, or to dispose of assets. Moreover, as a publicly-traded company, the potential adverse regulatory effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control could discourage bids for our shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares.
U.S. Department of Education
An institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility. ED’s regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly-traded company occurs in one of two ways: (i) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing a change of control; or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock, or ceases to be the largest stockholder. As a result, a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, including an acquisition resulting in a stockholder owning at least 25% of our outstanding stock, could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control.
Upon a change in ownership and control, an institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period prior to recertification. The HEA provides that ED may temporarily provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership and control based on preliminary review of a materially complete application received within 10 business days after the transaction. ED may continue such temporary provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it 
has rendered a final decision on the institution’s application. If ED determines to approve the application, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. 
When a change in ownership and control occurs, ED applies certain financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership, and the same-day balance sheet must satisfy certain requirements. In addition, when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner, the institution must submit to ED audited financial statements of the institution’s new owner’s two most recently completed fiscal years. ED may determine whether the financial statements meet financial responsibility standards with respect to the composite score formula. If the institution does not satisfy these requirements, ED may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution’s agreement to letters of credit, provisional certification, and additional monitoring requirements. The composite score formula and related ED conditions are described more fully above in “Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Financial Responsibility.” If the new owner does not have the required audited financial statements, ED may impose certain restrictions on the institution, including with respect to adding locations and programs.
State Regulatory Agencies
Many states require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status. The types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary, but many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval. A change of control may require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our state approval. 
Accreditors
Many accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval for certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary.
HLC, the accrediting agency for APUS and Rasmussen University, requires HLC-accredited institutions to inform HLC in advance of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to HLC include changes in the legal status, ownership, or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a for-profit institution. HLC must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution’s accreditation status. HLC also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval.
HLC oversight extends to defined changes that occur in an institution’s parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock could trigger additional reviews of the institution and possible change from accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks associated with these types of actions. In particular, a change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution’s ability to participate in Title IV programs, which in turn would impact the institution’s ability to participate in TA.
ABHES, the accrediting agency for HCN, requires its accredited institutions to notify ABHES of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring notice to and approval by ABHES include changes in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution. An institution must notify ABHES of a change of ownership within at least 45 days before the close of the transaction, and ABHES must act to reinstate the institution’s accreditation status after the change of ownership. ABHES also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval.
Should we attempt to enter into transactions with institutions accredited by other accreditors, we would be required to follow the requirements of such accreditors. Our management may not have experience with the accreditors of the target institution, which would increase the risks related to such a transaction and management of the institution subsequent to the transaction.
Other Agencies
In certain circumstances, state approving agencies responsible for oversight of veterans’ education benefits may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control. The state approving agency in Ohio approved the November 1, 2013 change of ownership of HCN, and state approving agencies will need to approve the Rasmussen 
Acquisition. However, there is no guarantee that the relevant state approving agencies will approve the Rasmussen Acquisition or any other future transactions.
Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs
ED may, as a condition of certification to participate in Title IV programs, require prior approval of new locations, programs, or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. ED’s regulations also require institutions to report and, in certain cases (such as when an institution is provisionally-certified), to seek approval for a new additional campus location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions.
The HEA requires for-profit institutions to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, ED regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional campus locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. The new campus location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution’s accrediting agency. 
Provisionally certified institutions of higher education such as APUS must seek prior approval from ED to offer new academic programs eligible for federal student aid. In order to acquire ED approval for a new academic program, APUS as a provisionally certified institution would need to submit electronic applications to ED with evidence of accreditor and state approvals for any proposed programs. APUS would not be able to disburse federal student aid to students in these new programs until ED adds the program to APUS’s Eligibility and Certification Approval Report. A fully-certified degree-granting institution generally is not obligated to obtain ED’s approval of an additional program leading to a degree at the same level previously approved by ED, or of a new program that both prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and meets certain minimum-length requirements. However, ED could require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. In the event that an institution is required to obtain ED’s approval for the addition of a new program, fails to do so, and erroneously determines that the new educational program is eligible for Title IV program funds, the institution could be liable for repayment of those Title IV program funds.
Other Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity
    Many of our students rely on federally funded programs, including Title IV programs, TA and education benefits administered by the VA that may be affected by changes in the federal budget. Due to the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and significant political interest in the cost of education, Congress continues to show interest in regulation and oversight of institutions of higher education, especially those that are for-profit.
Department of Defense
The Budget Control Act of 2011 put into place a series of automatic federal budget cuts, known as sequestration, that impacted certain federal student aid programs beginning in fiscal year 2013. As a result of uncertainty about the availability of funding, several military branches initially suspended and later announced changes to their tuition assistance programs. For example, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance, and the Army and the Coast Guard have both reduced the total per service member annual benefits. 
    Congressional inaction on budgetary matters has led to lapses in funding, resulting in government shutdowns, and subsequent policy changes that have affected federal student aid programs at DoD. For example, funding for the federal government lapsed on several occasions in 2018, resulting in partial government shutdowns. During a 35-day partial government shutdown that began in December 2018, the Coast Guard suspended its tuition assistance program. A future government shutdown, particularly one that includes DoD or suspension or resulting modification of DoD tuition assistance programs, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.
Funding shortfalls have also affected DoD federal student aid programs. In May 2019, the Navy announced that as a result of increased demand stemming from improvements in service delivery and higher limits on annual benefits available per sailor, TA benefits available to sailors for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 were expected to be exhausted by the end 
of May 2019, and effective May 28, 2019 the Navy ceased approving TA program funds for eligible sailors until the start of the new government fiscal year on October 1, 2019. Further, effective October 1, 2019, Navy service members must have a minimum of two years of service before becoming eligible to use tuition assistance or the Navy College Program for Afloat College Education, funding is capped at twelve semester hours per fiscal year, and career funding is capped at 120 semester hours. Effective October 1, 2021, the annual funding cap will increase to 18 semester hours. 

We expect each military branch and the DoD to continually evaluate their approach to education funding, and the resulting changes could have an impact on the funds available to service members to pursue their education at our institutions.
Higher Education Act
The HEA must be periodically reauthorized by Congress and each Title IV program must be funded through appropriations acts on an annual basis. The most recent comprehensive reauthorization occurred in 2008 when Congress reauthorized most HEA programs through the 2014 federal fiscal year. The previous Congress considered comprehensive legislation to reauthorize the HEA, including proposals from Republicans and Democrats, referred to as the Student Aid Improvement Act and the College Affordability Act, respectively, and Congress could consider such legislation again in the future.
We cannot predict whether, in what form, or when, the two houses of Congress will reauthorize the HEA or whether, or when, the President will sign reauthorization legislation. Amendments to the HEA could occur as part of reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations.
On December 19, 2019, the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act, or FUTURE Act, was signed into law. Among other things, the FUTURE Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow the Internal Revenue Service to share taxpayer data directly with ED, which is intended to streamline the process of applying for Title IV program aid, reduce the need for institutions to verify students’ eligibility for Title IV program funds, and simplify the process for borrowers to enroll in income-driven repayment plans with respect to their federal loans. 
Other Regulatory Activity 
Regulatory Reform Executive Order
Executive Order 13777, “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda,” signed by President Trump in February 2017, directed federal agencies including ED to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the agency head regarding the regulations. In October 2018, the ED Regulatory Reform Task Force announced that ED’s Office for Postsecondary Education had identified a total of 1,230 guidance documents that were out-of-date and that it intended to withdraw. Those documents constituted nearly 80% of the Office of Postsecondary Education’s total of 1,562 guidance documents. In January 2020, the ED Regulatory Reform Task Force issued a status report outlining actions ED had taken to address the findings in prior reports, including rulemakings related to accreditation, state authorization, TEACH grants, Title IV religious freedom, distance education, innovation, and Title IX.
Other Federal Rulemakings 
On December 11, 2019, in a notice of proposed rulemaking, ED published additional portions of the agreed-upon regulatory language, including provisions related to the participation of faith-based entities in the Title IV programs and certain rules related to the TEACH Grant program. The final rule, which was released on August 14, 2020 and is consistent with the proposed rule, is effective July 1, 2021.
On April 2, 2020, ED published a notice of proposed rulemaking based on consensus language agreed to by the Accreditation and Innovation Committee related to distance education. The final rule, released on August 24, 2020, is effective July 1, 2021. The rule provides institutions additional flexibility in offering distance education and competency-based education programs. New proposed definitions related to “academic engagement,” “distance education,” and “regular and substantive interaction” provide further clarity regarding the instructional requirements that distance education programs must abide by in order to remain eligible for Title IV disbursements. Failure to comply with these standards could lead to adverse actions by ED. 
On November 29, 2018, ED published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding related to implementation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs that receive funding from the federal government. The final rule, which was released on May 19, 2020, 
took effect on August 14, 2020. The regulations define what constitutes sexual harassment for purposes of Title IX in the administrative enforcement context, describe what actions trigger an institution’s obligation to respond to incidents of alleged sexual harassment, and specify how an institution must respond to allegations of sexual harassment.
