Item 1.    Business 
Overview
We were incorporated in Delaware in April 2018 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Parent under the name HS Spinco, Inc., and subsequently changed our name to Covetrus, Inc. We are a global animal-health technology and services company dedicated to supporting the companion, equine, and large-animal veterinary markets. Our mission is to provide the best products, services, and technology to veterinarians and animal-health practitioners (“Customers”) across the globe, so they can deliver exceptional care to their patients (“Animal Owners”) when and where it is needed. 
Segments
We manage our organization geographically in three reportable segments: (i) North America, (ii) Europe, and (iii) Asia Pacific (APAC) & Emerging Markets. Historically, the business was focused on driving growth through specific product and service offerings to our Customers; the Transactions allow us to bring together the different products and service offerings, along with prescription management, data analytics, and insights through veterinary practice management software, into one multi-channel veterinary platform. We will continue to focus on delivering this platform of products and services to our Customers on a geographical basis. We disaggregate our Net sales based on our major product categories: supply chain services, software services, and prescription management. See below, Item 7- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segments, Note 5 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and Note 20 - Segment Data.
Evolution of Covetrus
•Separation. In anticipation of the spin-off, affiliates of Covetrus purchased from certain minority holders their ownership interests in the applicable operating companies of the Animal Health Business. On February 7, 2019, Henry Schein completed the spin-off of its Animal Health Business and transferred the applicable assets, liabilities, and ownership interests to us (the “Separation”)
•Share Sale. Also, on February 7, 2019 and prior to the Distribution, we sold $361 million in shares to accredited institutional investors (the “Share Sale”). The proceeds from the Share Sale were paid to us and distributed to our Former Parent
•Distribution. All the shares of our common stock that were then owned by Henry Schein were distributed to its stockholders of record as of January 17, 2019 (the “Distribution”). Concurrent with the Distribution, we paid a cash 

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

dividend of $1.2 billion to our Former Parent from loan proceeds from our newly established credit facility (see Note 9 - Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings, Net)
•Acquisition. We then acquired Vets First Choice in an all-stock transaction (the “Acquisition”), and the following day, our shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CVET”
Through this Acquisition, we combined the complementary capabilities of the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice, bringing together innovative practice management software and supply chain and distribution businesses with a technology-enabled prescription management platform and related pharmacy services. We believe our approach to the market will support the delivery of improved veterinary care and the health of our customers' veterinary practices while driving increased demand for our products and services. Our strategic roadmap to an all-in-one solution for the veterinary market, see Our Strategy as discussed below, prioritizes providing our supply chain services, compounding services, practice management software (PIMS), and the prescription management platform, all through the Covetrus platform. We have been taking steps to enable this level of integration of our major product categories in 2019 and 2020:
2019
The Acquisition brought together the complementary capabilities of the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice. In 2019, while initiating our long-term transformation, we established our major product categories and began the process of integrating our product and service offerings:

Also, in 2019: 
•We made progress establishing a corporate infrastructure, including the people and the technology, necessary to support finance, human resources, information technology, and legal capabilities, among other functions, including exiting 18 transition service agreements (“TSAs”) in 2019
•We made significant investments in our portfolio of software services and technology-enabled prescription management platform that improved customer service and workflow and delivered deeper integration and coordination between our prescription management and software services businesses. We started the process of combining our prescription management and software services teams as one phase of our integration efforts
•We had early success in cross-selling and penetrating our existing supply chain services Customer base with our prescription management platform, delivering an increased number of enrollments on this platform, and increasing growth in our specialty-pharmacy and compounded-medications businesses
•We experienced further adoption of our proprietary and Covetrus-branded products and solutions inside our existing customer base as our integration efforts continued
2020
In connection with our strategic focus for 2020, we made advancements in streamlining our business through the following initiatives: 
In January 2020, we aligned our software services with our prescription management platform and related pharmacy services to create our “Global Technology Solutions” business which reflects the “voice of our Customers” throughout our suite of products, which includes solutions for practice management, client communications, and prescription management. This alignment focused the streamlining within our software services offerings and the integration of those services within the prescription management platform.
In December 2020, we announced the combination of the commercial organizations of our supply chain services and Global Technology Solutions in North America to provide one face to our Customers. This alignment of our organizations was particularly impactful in North America where the prescription management platform is already available to the veterinary market. As part of our strategic plan, we plan to make our prescription management platform accessible to our international 

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

markets as well. Our expectation of the future state of the technology experience on the Covetrus platform may include the potential for improved inventory management, streamlined technology solutions, support for prescription compliance, simplified Animal Owner engagement, and customizable views to leverage veterinary practice insights for success. 
Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures 
Our future success will largely depend on our ability to grow and adapt to the changes in the veterinary market. We expect to focus our deals strategy for 2021 and beyond on the faster-paced growth and higher margin areas of our business. Currently, these areas are our prescription management platform, Covetrus-branded and proprietary-branded products, compounding services, and software services.
Equity Method Investments
In April 2020, we completed the previously announced combination of our subsidiary, Spain Animal Health Solutions S.L.U. (“SAHS”), with Distrivet, S.A. to form a leading animal-health provider on the Iberian Peninsula called Distrivet, a Covetrus company (“Distrivet”). See Note 4 - Divestitures and Equity Method Investments.
Acquisitions 
In October 2020, we announced a strategic investment in Veterinary Study Groups, Inc. ("VSG") which was consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2020. This relationship brings together two highly complementary organizations each dedicated to veterinary practices and committed to driving enhanced patient care, empowering veterinarians to run better businesses, and advocating for the veterinary profession. This investment is an opportunity to accelerate our strategic initiative on driving increased customer alignment. See Note 3 - Business Acquisitions.
Divestitures
In April 2020, we completed the divestiture of our scil animal-care business (“scil”) to Heska Corporation (“Heska”) for approximately $100 million, net of deal-related fees and other transaction items. See Note 4 - Divestitures and Equity Method Investments.
During the third quarter of 2020, we announced a managed exit of the operations of our French distribution business specializing in medicines, pet food, equipment, and services for veterinary clinics. See Note 4 - Divestitures and Equity Method Investments.
Our Products and Services 
Our revenue from our product and service offerings is generated from our major product categories: supply chain services, software services, and prescription management. Included below are also certain of the available products and services:
Supply Chain Services
                
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services and value-added solutions for enhancing practice revenue, operating efficient practices, and delivering high-quality animal care. By combining our existing global scale and logistical expertise with robust software and ordering tools, a broad product offering at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, we strive to be an indispensable and trusted partner for our Customers’ evolving needs. As discussed above, a key area for further development is our Covetrus-branded and proprietary-branded products. These are products and solutions we manufacture and develop as well as engage third parties to manufacture products on our behalf, that we sell with Covetrus branding. Currently, our main proprietary brands are Vi, Kruuse, SmartPak, Calibra, and Covetrus-branded products. 
Software Services
We develop, provide, and support veterinary practices with a wide range of veterinary software systems. This includes practice management software, data-driven applications, client communications tools, and related services, which are designed to increase staff efficiency and improve business health, allowing the veterinarian more time to provide patient care. We also offer solutions that integrate with our software platforms, including client communication services, reminders, data backup services, hardware sales and support, and credit card processing. These integrated veterinary marketing services leverage practice-level data and consumer insights to deliver highly personal, relevant, and timely communications, strengthening the veterinary-client patient 

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

relationship and improving Animal Owners' loyalty. Our payment solutions also help veterinarians save time and money with credit card processing services, which we build into our veterinary software systems to streamline workflow.
Prescription Management

Our prescription management platform, which integrates into veterinary practice management software and workflow, leverages insight and analytics, client engagement and outreach communications, and integrated veterinary-pharmacy services and is designed to improve medical compliance. To bring these benefits to fruition, we work directly with veterinary practices to provide client and practice-level insights and identify gaps in medical care. 
Our Customers can access our accredited veterinary pharmacies to fulfill compounded, specialty, back-ordered, patient-specific customized medications, and in-clinic use medications through our prescription management platform. As discussed above, our strategic development includes investing in the prescription management platform and our high margin custom compounding services. We are growing our pharmacy presence in the U.S. to build the infrastructure necessary to support that growth. See Distribution Centers and Pharmacies below. 
Through our integrated product and service offerings available on our prescription management platform, we seek to enable our Customers to manage the lifecycle of a prescription to create new revenue opportunities, adapt to changing animal-owner purchasing behaviors, and strengthen their client relationships through convenience of our e-commerce, auto-ship services, and access to accredited veterinary pharmacies for standard prescriptions, preventatives, diets, and custom-compounded medications. These products and services ultimately allow our Customers to improve the quality of animal care that is provided.

Our Customers
Our customer base is comprised principally of animal-health and veterinary practices and clinics in the companion-animal, equine, and large-animal markets in North America, Europe, and APAC & Emerging Markets. These veterinary practices consist of both small, privately owned businesses and an increasing number of corporate-owned practices. We also serve animal-health providers and producers and pet specialty retail stores. Our major product categories service customers in the following markets:
•Supply chain customers in North America, Europe, and APAC & Emerging Markets
•Software services customers in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and certain other countries
•Prescription management and pharmacy services customers in the U.S
Distribution Centers and Pharmacies
As of December 31, 2020, we own or lease the following properties which are integral to our global operations as well as necessary infrastructure investment for our future growth, for example, with our investments in our higher-margin businesses (as compared to our supply chain services), like compounding pharmacies. The pharmacies below are fully licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
•Warehouses: 41 globally
•Offices: 65 globally
•Pharmacies: 4(a) in the U.S.
(a) Excluding Atlas Pharmaceuticals, an outsourcing facility 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing teams are focused on (i) generating new sales through direct and frequent communication with customers and Animal Owners, (ii) facilitating order processing, (iii) staying abreast of marketing developments, and (iv) educating practice personnel regarding the hundreds of new products, services, and technologies introduced each year.
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused in the following areas:
•Establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives and contact from our inside sales team
•Use of our direct sales force, which we augment through our channel partners and other marketing initiatives 
•Expanding our relationships with strategic accounts and pharmaceutical manufacturers
Effective January 1, 2021, we aligned our North America segment commercial organizations to drive increased strategic alignment between our customers and our full scope of products and capabilities available to those customers. The new structure brings together our North America segment commercial teams under unified leadership to maximize account management and support for our Customers’ businesses. We also changed our sales compensation structure in North America to better align with our strategic goals. This change also unlocks resources for our Global Technology Solutions team to focus on executing on our technology roadmap, including new software, e-commerce enhancements, and bringing our prescription management platform to new geographies in 2021 and beyond.
COVID-19 and Our Return to Work
To protect the health and safety of our employees, we implemented workplace regulations and guidelines recommended from government and public health authorities related to COVID-19. This includes frequent washing of hands, daily disinfecting of workspaces, and limiting non-essential travel. For employees who recently traveled to affected areas, a two-week quarantine is required prior to returning to work. In our pharmacies, it has been our standard practice to strictly comply with United States Pharmacopeia regulations on the use and application of personal protective equipment by all staff. In March 2020, we transitioned a large portion of our teams to working remotely and implemented staggered schedules in our distribution facilities. In October 2020, we issued internal guidance on the expected return to work in July 2021 for our North America workforce that is currently operating remotely. Outside of North America, we adhere to the regulations and guidelines instituted by local authorities in our area of operations and make judgments with the best available information at the time. We created a COVID-19 information portal on our intranet that provides best practices for working at home and staying connected, communications from our leadership, internal contacts for any COVID-19 questions, and helpful external reference links.

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

We also assembled three cross-functional task forces that actively monitor our return-to-work guidelines. These task forces are global and their goal is to maintain a comprehensive plan of best practices for our essential facilities such as distribution centers and pharmacies and establish protocols for field-based employees to return to customer sites and for us to re-open our offices to safely accommodate more office-based employees.
Our return to work plan addresses four main areas:

•Health & Safety - create work schedules and rotations, use of personal protective equipment, and provide protocols for employee health screening, sick notifications, on-site visitors, and more
•Operations - deploy best practices and guidance for employee workspace reconfiguration required to support social distancing, cleaning protocols, training, and compliance management 
•Commercial - enable and support field-based employees to make customer visits by establishing safety guidelines and strategies for our field sales teams
•Communications - communicate updates of employee-related policies and provide materials, onsite signage, and employee training on updated safety protocols and policies
We will continue to actively monitor how COVID-19 is impacting us and may take further actions to alter our business operations in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. 
Our Strategy
Our current three-year strategic plan prioritizes the following:

2020 | 2021 | 2022 
Streamline | Synchronize | Accelerate 
Focus Our Business | Harmonize Our Capabilities | Expand Our Offering

As a recently-formed and publicly listed company, we prioritized what we believe were the necessary building blocks to our independent operations and future success: (i) establishing reliable worldwide Customer support alongside a planned elimination of our reliance on our TSAs with our Former Parent, (ii) increasing coordination across our business units and technology capabilities as we phase-in our global integration efforts, and (iii) strengthening our capabilities so that we will be able to penetrate our Customer base across our various markets to tap into growth opportunities. In 2020, we made the following streamlining steps: 
Focus
•Exited all of the remaining TSAs we had with our Former Parent
•Leveraged shared services to maximize efficiency and enhanced career development
•Integrated our software services and prescription management major product groups into Global Technology Solutions. We made significant investments in our portfolio of software services and technology-enabled prescription management platform that improved customer service and workflow and delivered deeper integration and coordination between our prescription management and software services businesses 
•Combined our North American commercial organizations to provide “one face to our customer”
•Instituted broad-based cost containment measures and spending discipline to adapt to the changing COVID-19 economic environment

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

Team
•Onboarded several more leaders with experience in driving growth and transformation to increase coordination across our business units and technology capabilities as we phase-in our global integration efforts and tap into growth opportunities
•Created a global diversity, equity, and inclusion program
•Launched the Covetrus hardship fund to help our colleagues with COVID-19 illness-related hardship
Differentiate
•Launched telemedicine at a critical moment for our customers
•Offered new Customer and Animal Owner strategies on our prescription management platform to help veterinary practices drive growth, improve clinical care and compliance, deter competition from alternative channels, as well as capitalize on COVID-19 industry changes
•Invested in Veterinary Study Groups (“VSG”) to strengthen customer relationships. This investment is expected to improve our scale, offer new avenues for driving our proprietary products and solutions, and enhance our overall growth and margin profile
Globalize
•Centralized our direct and indirect sourcing initiatives to coordinate purchasing activity and leverage our global scale
•We combined our Spanish and Portuguese supply chain and distribution businesses with Distrivet, to create a business with broader reach (Distrivet, a Covetrus company) 
•Launched the framework for globalizing our prescription management platform (part of our Covetrus platform)
As we continue to expand on our accomplishments, our priorities entering 2021 are centered on driving improved outcomes and a differentiated value proposition for our stakeholders and delivering profitable growth through the increased adoption and utilization of our higher margin services, including: (i) growing our Covetrus-branded and proprietary products, (ii) sustaining our momentum in prescription management, and (iii) adding more resources to our compounding business. Executing against these will enable us to continue to invest in our product roadmap and bring our prescription management platform to new global markets in 2021 and beyond. 2021 is our year to synchronize.

Our Team

As of December 31, 2020, our global workforce was comprised of 5,657 employees (5,275 full-time employees and 382 part-time employees). Our employee base extends to 22 countries. Women represented 50% of our global workforce as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, 40% of the members of our Board of Directors were women.

We are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent globally. Our strategy is centered around our commitment to build a strong culture and teams, attract and retain the best talent, enable scale, effectiveness, and efficiency, and maintain the right capabilities and talent to drive business success.
Our culture is driven by our core values: Do Good, Never Settle, Give Power, Be Passionate, and Share the Customer Goal
These values drive our commitment to and investment in our people in the following ways:
•We created a global diversity, equity, and inclusion program, which includes a global advisory board and a number of global, business unit, and regional diversity and inclusion leads dedicated to driving our commitments and strategic focus areas as well as to ensure local support. The executive sponsors of program are Sharon Wienbar (member of our Board of Directors) and Ben Wolin (President and Chief Executive Officer). Our five diversity and inclusion commitments to drive lasting change within five years are:
Diversity-focused recruitment
Goal: employ a diverse workforce that is demographically reflective of our society
Diversify the animal-health industry
Goal: do good by changing both Covetrus and the industry
Employee education and training
Goal: foster diversity and inclusion for all employees at all levels
Inclusion & employee resource groups
Goal: create a workplace of inclusion and belonging
Transparency
Goal: capture data and be publicly accountable for a more diverse workforce

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

•In 2020, we launched a global employee development program designed to build capabilities and accelerate transformation. Nearly 5,000 employees were enrolled in our 10-month virtual academy, which included digital lessons, team-based action planning, and peer-to-peer coaching
•We are actively engaged in monitoring and improving our organization health to empower our employees to have a voice and connect to our common goals. Our goal is to be a top talent destination by the end of 2021
•COVID-19 specific:
◦For employees who continued to work on site, we took deliberate measures to ensure safety in the workplace, from extra sanitation, issuing of personal protective equipment, employee training, and implementation of social distancing requirements
◦In August of 2020, with our focus on our team, retaining our hardworking talent, and the knowledge of how COVID-19 may be affecting team members in their personal lives, we launched the Covetrus Hardship Fund to help our colleagues with COVID-19 illness-related hardship
We believe we maintain positive relations with our employees. In certain countries, we are bound by union agreements negotiated by the employer's association with the respective union representatives. We are also party to shop agreements on workplace-related issues, negotiated with works councils at individual facilities that relate to those facilities.
Our Competition
The market for providing products, services, and technology to the global animal-health industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added services, service and delivery levels, credit terms, and customer support. Substantially all of the products we sell are available to Customers from a number of distributors, manufacturers and suppliers and, increasingly, some are being sold directly to Animal Owners and, as a result, significant price reductions by our competitors or changes in how products are ultimately procured by Animal Owners could result in competitive harm.
Our principal competitors include:
•Animal Health Divisions of Traditional Distribution Companies: the MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.
•Animal Health-focused Companies: national, regional, and local full-service distributors, online commerce such as Amazon.com, Inc. and zooplus AG, retail and online pharmacy providers such as Chewy, Inc., PetMed Express, Inc., and Strategic Pharmaceutical Solutions, Inc. (d/b/a Vetsource), as well as manufacturers of animal-health products that sell directly to veterinary practices and retailers, thereby eliminating or reducing the role of distribution
•Practice Management Service Providers: IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and several regional and local veterinary software vendors, including those offering cloud-based solutions
Additionally, the growth in online and brick-and-mortar retailers offering certain animal-health products and services directly to Animal Owners continues to impact our Customers and, in turn, our business given our strategic alignment with the veterinary community. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend. Our operating results may be materially adversely affected should this trend continue. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well situated within the markets in which we compete. We expect that our comprehensive and integrated multi-channel capabilities that are focused on empowering animal care givers, providing expertise, and delivering on a global scale will allow us to maintain and strengthen existing Customer relationships, win new business, and unlock new demand and access additional revenue opportunities while addressing the evolving needs of our Customers, Animal Owners, and our manufacturing partners.

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

Seasonality
Our quarterly sales and operating results have varied from period to period in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future. In the companion-animal market, sales of parasite protection products have historically tended to be stronger during the spring and summer months, primarily due to an increase in vector-borne diseases during that time, which correlates with our second and third quarters given that most of our business is in the northern hemisphere. Parasite protection products represented 22% of our global Net sales in 2020. Buying patterns can also be affected by manufacturers’ and distributors’ marketing programs or price increase announcements, which can cause veterinarians to purchase animal-health products earlier than when those products are needed. This kind of early purchasing may reduce our sales in the quarters these purchases would have otherwise been made. The sales of animal products can also vary due to changes in the price of commodities used in manufacturing the products and weather patterns, which may also affect period-over-period financial results. We expect our historical seasonality trends to continue in the foreseeable future.
Working Capital
Our principal capital requirements include the funding of working capital needs, debt service, strategic investments, build out of our infrastructure, and capital expenditures. We require substantial working capital, which is susceptible to fluctuations in the level of accounts receivables and inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands throughout the year. We extend credit to many of our customers globally in the ordinary course of business, which increases accounts receivable balances within our business segments and is dependent, to an extent, on seasonal demand. Our sales terms vary from due immediately for credit card payments to significantly longer periods generally offered to larger customers. Inventory purchase activity and stock levels are also dependent on sales activity and seasonal demand, however, on occasion, we consider special inventory buy-in opportunities to achieve better purchase terms and earn larger rebates. 
Intellectual Property
We own multiple trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are important to our business. We believe that our trademarks are well recognized in the animal-health industry and by veterinarians and, therefore, are valuable assets.

Laws and Regulations
Our prescription management and pharmacy services business, which currently operates only in the U.S., is affected by federal and state laws and regulations governing, among other things, the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, marketing, and labeling of prescription and non-prescription drugs and related services. In addition, we are subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and comparable state regulations affecting the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industries, including state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards, state and federal controlled substance laws, and statutes and regulations related to FDA approval of the sale and marketing of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices. State pharmacy laws require pharmacies to be licensed or otherwise authorized to dispense prescription medications.
Our pharmacies are in Arizona, Maine, Nebraska, and Texas and authorized to dispense prescription medication in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Non-resident pharmacies are licensed similar to resident pharmacies. As such, each prescription for a medication that is fulfilled by one of our pharmacies is generally covered by the laws of the state where the Animal Owner is located. The laws and regulations relating to the sale and delivery of prescription medications vary from state to state but generally require that prescription medications be dispensed with the authorization from a prescribing veterinarian.

The sale of animal-health products is also governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products.
United States
The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal-health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) housed within the FDA. Generally, all animal-health pharmaceuticals are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be safe, effective, and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the drug is for food-producing animals, potential consequences for humans are also considered. The FDA’s basis for approving a drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports being provided to the CVM’s Surveillance and Compliance group. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events, or unexpected results are produced in accordance with the law. Animal supplements generally are not required to obtain pre-market approval from the CVM, although they may be treated as a food. Any substance that is added to, or is expected to become a component of, animal food must be used in accordance with a food-additive regulation, unless it is generally recognized as safe, under the conditions of its intended use. Alternatively, the FDA may consider animal supplements to be drugs. The FDA has agreed to exercise enforcement discretion for such supplements if each such supplement meets certain conditions.
The regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biologics, such as vaccines, is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal-health vaccines, including immunotherapeutics. Marketing of imported veterinary biological products in the U.S. requires a U.S. Veterinary Biological Product Permit. Veterinary biologics are subject to pre-market review and must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious, as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-licensing monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events, or unexpected results are produced in accordance with USDA requirements.
The main regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary pesticides is the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. Animal-health pesticides are subject to pre-market review and must not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the U.S., pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
Under the Controlled Substances Act, distributors of controlled substances are required to obtain, and renew annually, registrations for their facilities from the DEA. Distributors are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times. Distributors are subject to inspection by the DEA.
Advertising and promotion of animal-health products that are not subject to approval by the CVM may be challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), as well as by state attorneys general and by consumers under state consumer protection laws. The FTC regulates advertising pursuant to its authority to prevent “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC will find an advertisement to be deceptive if it contains a representation or omission of fact that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is material, and if the advertiser does not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis, such as competent and reliable evidence, substantiating the claim. The FTC may attack unfair or deceptive advertising practices through either an administrative adjudication or judicial enforcement action, including preliminary or permanent injunction. The FTC may also seek consumer redress from the advertiser in instances of dishonest or fraudulent conduct.
States may require registration of animal-drug distributors and wholesalers. Additional requirements may apply when the product is also a controlled substance. States work closely with the Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) in their regulation of animal food. The AAFCO’s annual Official Publication contains model animal and pet-food labeling regulations that states may adopt. The publication is treated deferentially by the federal and state government agencies that regulate animal food. Many states require registration or licensing of animal-food distributors. States may also review and approve animal-food labels prior to sale of the product in their state.

European Union
Veterinary medicines (which includes both prescription and over-the-counter products) must obtain a marketing authorization (“MA”) before they can be imported, marketed, and sold in any European Union (“EU”) member state. In broad terms, there are four different routes for obtaining MAs: (i) a centralized EU-wide authorization procedure, (ii) national authorization procedures for each member state, (iii) a mutual recognition procedure involving at least two member states, and (iv) the decentralized procedure.
The centralized authorization route is used to obtain MAs for marketing and sale of veterinary medicines throughout all the EU member states as well as those countries in the European Free Trade Area (the “EFTA”). The European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”), located in London, is responsible for assessing applications made under the centralized route. The agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU. The agency has a specialized veterinary review section distinct from the human medical review section. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products is responsible for scientific review of the submissions for pharmaceuticals and vaccines. The EMA makes the final decision on the approval of products. Once granted by the European Commission (the “EC”) a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states and EFTA states. A series of Regulations, Directives, Guidelines, and EU Pharmacopeia Monographs provide the requirements for approval in the European Union. In general, these requirements are like those in the U.S., requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy, and consistency of manufacturing processes. The EMA works closely with the competent authorities of each member state in the regulation of veterinary medicines, including with respect to pharmacovigilance and testing for residues of veterinary medicines or illegal substances in animals and animal products.
Veterinary medicines can also be authorized on a national level through application to the relevant member state’s competent authority. If a product already has been authorized in at least one EU member state, then the mutual recognition procedure can be used to gain approval in other member states. Finally, the decentralized procedure may be used if the product is not authorized in any member state and the applicant would like authorization in several or all member states. This may occur where the centralized procedure is not mandatory, the product is not eligible for the centralized procedure, or where the applicant does not wish to use the centralized procedure.
The EC must authorize animal-feed additives. The European Food Safety Authority (the “EFSA”) assesses applications on behalf of the EC. The EFSA will analyze a sample of the feed additive and provide an opinion within six months of receiving the application. The EC will decide whether to grant or deny an authorization of the additive based upon this opinion. When authorized, all companies can (subject to any relevant third-party intellectual property rights) usually benefit from the authorization.
An EU regulation on animal medicines, which became effective in November 2018, relates to the advertising of veterinary products, in addition to various regulation that applies in individual EU member states. Health claims on animal pet food must not be misleading and claims that a food fulfills a nutritional need must be in line with the list of permitted claims that is published in an EU directive.
United Kingdom
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (the “VMD”) is the United Kingdom’s competent national authority responsible for overseeing the regulation of veterinary medicines in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). U.K. national applications follow an approach like centralized EU applications. The VMD is also responsible for post-market surveillance and adverse event reporting.
Australia
The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (the “APVMA”) is an Australian government statutory authority established to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products in the Australian marketplace. Previously, each state and territory government had its own system of registration. The primary legislation governing the APVMA’s activities is the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code, or the AgVet Code. The AgVet Code is in turn given force of law pursuant to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth).
The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can import, promote, and supply their products to the marketplace, and under the AgVet Code, the APVMA must be satisfied that any active constituents or chemical products will not have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, occupational health and safety, or trade, and that the product is effective for its intended use. Applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the APVMA’s scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, commonwealth government 

Covetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K

departments, and state agriculture departments. Labeling standards apply and pre-approval is required by the APVMA for veterinary-chemical products. In addition, all advertising and promotion of products is subject to the Australian Consumer Law, which, like the U.S. and European Union, emphasizes accuracy and transparency in advertising and prohibits any misleading or deceptive conduct.
If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment, or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. As well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products, the APVMA reviews older products that have been on the market for a substantial period to ensure they are still effective and safe to use. The APVMA also reviews registered products when concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness. The review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration or continuing registration with some changes to the way the product can be used. In some cases, the review may result in the registration of a product being cancelled and the product taken off the market. The APVMA has the power to order compulsory product recalls and enforcement powers to ensure compliance with the requirements of the AgVet Code.
New Zealand
All veterinary medicines, agricultural chemicals, and vertebrate toxic agents imported into New Zealand must be authorized under the Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines (the “ACVM”) Act and regulations. The New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries maintains an ACVM Register of products that have been assessed to the ACVM Act registration information requirements and considered appropriate for registration. Conditions may be applied to such registration. The New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority (the “NZ EPA”) regulates the supply and use of hazardous substances. The NZ EPA operates various hazardous substances databases which can be searched to determine what controls have been placed on particular substances. Veterinary medicines that are hazardous substances require approval under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act before they can be imported or manufactured in New Zealand. Animal-nutritional and animal-care products are covered by a group-standard approval.
Rest of world
Country-specific laws have provisions that include requirements for licensing, regulatory approvals, certain labeling, safety, efficacy, and manufacturers’ quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. Many other countries’ regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union, and other international animal-health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health and the Codex Alimentarius Commission, in establishing standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
