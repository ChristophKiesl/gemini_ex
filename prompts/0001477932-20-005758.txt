Recent Developments
 
Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the globe. In addition to the devastating effects on human life, the pandemic is having a negative ripple effect on the global economy, leading to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets. Most U.S. states and many countries have issued policies intended to stop or slow the further spread of the disease such as issuing temporary Executive Orders that, among other stipulations, effectively prohibit in-person work activities for most industries and businesses, having the effect of suspending or severely curtailing operations. COVID-19 and the U.S’s response to the pandemic are significantly affecting the economy. There are no comparable events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate effect of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the ultimate impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, which cannot be reasonably predicted at this time. Accordingly, while management reasonably expects the COVID-19 outbreak to negatively impact the Company, the related consequences and duration are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. 
History and Overview
 
On December 31, 2012, AquaLiv Technologies, Inc. (“ALTI”) and Verity Farms II, Inc. (“Verity Farms”), a South Dakota corporation, entered into a Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, ALTI acquired 100% of the authorized and issued shares of Verity Farms in exchange (the “Exchange”) for 4,850,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, of ALTI, representing approximately 86% of the outstanding shares of ALTI, on a fully-diluted basis, assuming conversion into common stock. As a result of the Exchange and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, Verity Farms became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALTI and ALTI acquired Verity Farms’ business operations. ALTI was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 11, 2006 originally under the name of Infrared Systems International “ISI” as a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Sxan Biotech, Inc. (“CSBI”) (then known as Advance Technologies, Inc.) to pursue a narrowly defined business objective called infrared security systems.
 
On April 1, 2013, the Company changed its name from AquaLiv Technologies Inc. to Verity Corp. and our stock symbol changed to VRTY. 
 
The Company was the parent of Verity Farms and Aistiva Corporation (“Aistiva”) (f/k/a AquaLiv, Inc.). Verity Farms was dedicated to providing consumers with safe, high-quality and nutritious food sources through sustainable crop and livestock production. Aistiva previously released products in the industries of water treatment, skincare, and agriculture. Verity Farms was administratively dissolved in the State of South Dakota on May 4, 2018. Aistivia was administratively dissolved on April 9, 2015, in the State of Washington.
 
In February 2016, all of the Company’s officers and directors resigned, and the Company stopped substantially all operating activities. Since such time, and currently, the Company is a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Receivership 
 
The Company is currently in receivership. 
 
On May 16, 2016, pursuant to Case Number A16-733815-B, Nevada’s 8th Judicial District, Business Court, appointed Robert Stevens as receiver (the “Receiver”) for the Company. Creditors were required to provide claims in writing under oath on or before November 3, 2016, or they would be barred under Nevada Revised Statute §78.675. 
 
Since May 16, 2016, through the date of this Annual Report, the Company has been operating under the direction of the Receiver.

On March 22, 2018, the District Court in Clark County, Nevada approved a plan of reorganization that involved authorizing the cancellation of all preferred shares of the Company, the cancellation of certain insider shares, a reverse stock split up to a maximum of 200-1, and a reorganization that would place the liquidation of the Company’s assets under a liquidating trustee while maintaining the public, purchasers for value with equity in the surviving entity. Once the reorganization is completed the Receiver will be discharged. 
 
Change of Domicile and Plan of Conversion 
 
On March 15, 2019, Healthcare Solutions Management Group, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware. Verity Delaware, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 11, 2019. Verity Merger Corp. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 15, 2019. On March 11, 2019, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Conversion, the Company, then a Nevada corporation named Verity Corp., converted into and became Verity Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation in Delaware and on May 30, 2019, the conversion was completed in Nevada. As a result of the foregoing, Verity Corp. a Nevada corporation converted into and became Verity Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On May 8, 2019, pursuant to a Plan of Merger, Verity Delaware, Inc. was merged with and into Verity Merger Corp., with Verity Merger Corp. surviving, and with Healthcare Solutions Management Group, Inc. becoming a successor in interest to Verity Delaware Inc. and the parent company of Verity Merger Corp.
 
Name and Trading Symbol Change
 
Since Healthcare Solutions Management Group, Inc. became the successor in interest to Verity Delaware Inc. a Delaware corporation which was previously a Nevada corporation named Verity Corp., the Company’s current name is Healthcare Solutions Management Group, Inc. The Company plans to submit an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form (the “Name Change”) to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to request that the Company’s name be updated to its current name and to change the Company’s trading symbol accordingly. The Company has not yet submitted the Name Change to FINRA and there can be no assurance that FINRA will process the Name Change as planned, or at all.
No Current Operations
 
In February 2016, all of the Company’s officers and directors resigned, and the Company stopped substantially all operating activities. Since such time, and currently, the Company is a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Since May 16, 2016, through the date of this Annual Report, the Company has been operating under the direction of the Receiver.
 
The Company has no operations at this time, and currently does not have any principal products or services, customers or intellectual property. As the Company has no current operations, it also currently is not subject to any competitive business conditions. Further, the Company is not subject to any government approvals at this time, other than those related to the receivership and those applicable to it as a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
Employees
 
As of October 6, 2020, we have no part-time or full-time employees (excluding the Receiver and his staff). Since May 16, 2016, through the date of this Annual Report, the Company has been operating under the direction of the Receiver.
Merger Agreement with Healthcare Solutions Holdings, Inc.
 
On June 14, 2019, the Company (the successor in interest to Verity Delaware Inc., a Delaware corporation which was previously a Nevada corporation named Verity Corp.) entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) by and between the Company, Verity Merger Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”), and Healthcare Solutions Holdings, Inc. (“HSH”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the parties agreed that Merger Sub would merge with and into HSH, with HSH being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”).

The closing of the Merger is planned to take place on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver (by the party for whose benefit the condition exists) of the closing conditions in the Merger Agreement or on such other date and at such other time and place as the parties agree in writing.
 
Upon the effective time of the Merger, (i) HSH’s certificate of incorporation will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving company, (ii) HSH’s bylaws will be the bylaws of the surviving company, (iii) HSH’s directors immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger will be the directors of the surviving company and (iv) HSH’s officers immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger will be the officers of the surviving company. 
 
At the closing of the Merger, it is planned that the Receiver will elect Justin Smith, Jonathan Loutzenhiser and Dr. Charles Balaban as members of the Company’s board of directors, and then resign. 
 
The aggregate Merger consideration to be paid to the holders of the HSH common stock at the effective time of the Merger will be an aggregate number of shares of the Company’s common stock constituting 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock immediately following the closing. 
 
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of HSH common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares canceled as provided in the Merger Agreement, if any), will be converted into shares of Company common stock, at an exchange ratio as required to cause the number of shares of Company common stock issued to the holders of the HSH common stock to be 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company common stock immediately following the closing, which is currently expected to result in an exchange ratio of 127.33306 shares of Company common stock per share of HSH common stock (as ultimately so determined, the “Exchange Ratio”), with any fractional shares of Company common stock being rounded to the nearest whole share of Company common stock. The Exchange Ratio will be finally determined by the parties to the Merger Agreement prior to the closing.
 
As consideration for the services of Robert Stevens and his team, for acting as the court-appointed receiver for the Company and its predecessor and affiliated entities, and pursuant the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to certain parties as directed by Mr. Stevens, shares of Company common stock equal to 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock prior to the closing, which will therefore constitute 9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock immediately following the closing (the “Receiver Shares”). 
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including that HSH will have provided to the Company, HSH’s audited and unaudited financial statements as required to be included in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
The Merger Agreement is not subject to a financing condition. The parties have made customary representations, warranties, and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also contains a customary “no-shop” covenant prohibiting the Company from soliciting proposals for alternative acquisition or providing information or participating in any discussions in connection with any such proposals.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights that may be exercised by the Company or HSH, as applicable, including in the event that (i) both parties agree by mutual written consent to terminate the Merger Agreement, (ii) the Merger is not consummated by September 30, 2020 (as set forth in the “Amendment” discussed below), or (iii) any law or order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger having become final and non-appealable.
 
The Merger is intended to be a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the Merger Agreement is intended to be a “plan of reorganization” within the meaning of the regulations promulgated under Section 368(a) of the Code and for the purpose of qualifying as a tax-free transaction for federal income tax purposes.
 
On August 25, 2020, the parties to the merger agreement entered into amendment no. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Merger Agreement pursuant to which the date provided to consummate the Merger Agreement was extended from July 30, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Further, pursuant to the Amendment, the Company and HSH agreed to reasonably cooperate to terminate the engagement of the Company’s prior registered agent in Nevada, with the costs related thereto to be paid by HSH. Further, pursuant to the Amendment, the Company agreed to issue the Receiver Shares as required by the Merger Agreement in book entry within 10 days of August 25, 2020. The Receiver Shares were issued on August 27, 2020 and consisted of a total of 114,599,754 shares of Company common stock.

Further, pursuant to the Amendment, HSH agreed to pay the costs and expenses of the Company resulting from the Company’s engagement of professional service providers, including, but not limited to, those of the transfer agent, legal counsel and auditors, until the earlier of the closing or the termination of the Merger Agreement. 
 
Further, pursuant to the Amendment, the parties acknowledged that the Company and HSH are represented by the same legal counsel and that counsel has advised each of the parties to retain separate counsel to review the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Amendment, and that each party waived such right and waived any related conflicts of interests and confirmed that the parties have previously negotiated the material terms of the Merger Agreement and the Amendment. Further, pursuant to the Amendment, the prior notice person for the Company was removed.
 
Other than the foregoing, no other material changes were made to the Merger Agreement in the Amendment.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Amendment, and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the Merger Agreement, and the Amendment, copies of which are as Exhibit 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, the Merger has not been consummated; and neither HSH nor the Company has exercised its termination rights. The Company is currently in discussions with HSH to extend the date provided to consummate the Merger Agreement from September 30, 2020 to a later date, however there can be no assurances that such discussions will be successful. 
 
The Company believes the Merger will be consummated, however, there can be no assurances.
