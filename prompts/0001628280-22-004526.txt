Our Mission and Strategy 
Our mission is to translate complex, powerful biology with rigor and urgency into life-changing medicines. Our strategy is built on a straightforward central premise: create an environment that both allows drug discovery research to thrive by focusing on powerful human biology unconstrained by therapeutic area or technology approach and remain grounded in the singular motivation of delivering impactful medicines to address critical unmet or underserved needs of patients suffering from grievous diseases. All therapeutic candidates in our pipeline have been generated by our in-house discovery engine, with a therapeutic area-agnostic mindset, always led by biology and motivated by patient need. 
Key elements of our strategy are:
•Systematically and empirically interrogate complex disease-associated biology.  We employ unbiased, systematic investigations of complex disease-associated biology in pursuit of uncovering novel mechanisms of action and identifying proprietary insights into critical biological processes and pathways demonstrating powerful biological effects.

•Remain biologics-focused, but modality flexible, leveraging a versatile approach to designing unique solutions for complex problems. Building on these biological insights, we deploy our protein and antibody engineering expertise to create product candidates designed to be highly specific, to modulate targeted processes and to boost therapeutic potential. We have an unbiased antibody generation approach and use an array of modalities and technologies to optimize the properties of our antibody product candidates and native proteins.
•Urgently advance therapies to meet unmet needs. We seek to move promising product candidates we have discovered and developed rapidly into proof-of-concept clinical studies and, if warranted, late-stage development.
•Build a diversified pipeline, honed with disciplined prioritization. We seek to allocate our capital efficiently and strategically and fund our portfolio based on each program’s scientific and other merits. Our discipline has been demonstrated by our decision not to proceed with development activities on multiple potentially viable product candidates for portfolio management reasons to concentrate our resources on what we consider our most promising product candidates. 
•Recruit and retain industry-leading research and development talent. Our talented and experienced team is the foundation of our company. We aim to attract outstanding individuals with expertise in discovery sciences, protein and antibody engineering, pharmacology, translational medicine and preclinical and clinical development who are committed to sustaining and enhancing our scientific excellence, rigor and innovation, our creative clinical development and our high level of productivity.  
•Pursue collaborations with strategic partners when beneficial. Partnering has been and is expected to continue to be a key component of our strategy. For example, our collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, described in more detail below, has historically provided us with robust financial support that enabled us to broaden and accelerate our research efforts and to develop more product candidates for major indications than we could have advanced on our own. Given the breadth of opportunities that have been, and may in the future be, produced by our prolific discovery engine, we may decide to pursue additional strategic partners to progress, in whole or in part, some of our wholly-owned product candidates and/or commercialize any resulting approved products.

Key Therapeutic Areas and Pipeline Programs
Our discovery engine supports our ability to span multiple therapeutic areas. Our current diverse pipeline of seven product candidates can be divided into three therapeutic areas: oncology, retinal diseases and liver and metabolic diseases.
Therapeutic Area: Oncology
Cancer Disease Overview
Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and was responsible for an estimated almost ten million deaths in 2020. There were an estimated over 19 million newly diagnosed cancer cases around the world in 2020, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. By 2040, the number of new cancer cases globally per year is expected to rise to 29.5 million and the number of cancer-related deaths per year to grow to 16.4 million. Cancer was the second leading cause of death in the United States in 2020, causing approximately 600,000 deaths that year. 
The unmet medical need for pancreatic cancer is high. About 60,000 patients were estimated to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2021. Pancreatic cancer is seldom detected early when it is most curable because symptoms often do not develop until after it has spread to other organs. The one-year survival rate across all stages of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which accounts for more than 90% of all pancreatic tumors, is 18%, reflecting the fact that tumors progress rapidly and the advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. Prognosis is also impacted by the high incidence of cancer-related cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients.
Table of Contents

Cancer-related cachexia is a disorder that causes extreme weight loss and muscle wasting that is debilitating and life-threatening and for which there is no therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. Cachexia is a common co-morbidity linked to many cancers and is associated with increased hospitalization and shortened survival compared to patients with cancer who do not exhibit cachexia. Cachexia is estimated to be the direct cause of approximately 30% of cancer deaths globally and is estimated to affect 60 to 80% of advanced cancer patients. Furthermore, studies have shown that patients with cancer who do not experience body weight loss have an improved prognosis. While cachexia can occur in all types of cancer, particularly high incidence rates are observed in pancreatic, non-small cell lung and gastric cancers, at 54%, 36% and 67% of patients, respectively.
NGM707, NGM831 and NGM438: Our Myeloid Reprogramming and Checkpoint Inhibition Portfolio Designed to Enhance Anti-Tumor Immunity
Over the past decade, advances in cancer immunotherapy have driven significant improvements in clinical outcomes, especially in certain cancer types that are immunogenic, or capable of provoking an immune response. In particular, T cell checkpoint inhibitors, including immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 and Programmed Cell Death Protein Ligand 1, or PD-1 and PD-L1, respectively, are designed to inhibit immune checkpoint pathways. When turned “on,” these pathways act as “brakes” on anti-tumor immune responses, enabling tumors to evade detection and destruction by the immune system, and T cell checkpoint inhibitors essentially work to “release” the “brakes” by turning off those pathways. However, the overall response rate to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is typically only 20% to 30% and many cancer patients who initially experience a full or partial response using T cell checkpoint inhibitors may eventually experience cancer progression.
We have focused our cancer research on an emerging area of immuno-oncology research known as myeloid checkpoint inhibition. The tumor microenvironment, or TME, is composed of both cancerous and non-malignant cells. There is an abundance of myeloid cells present in the TME of many tumor types. While myeloid cells play a critical role in the immune system, in the tumor they can contribute to the inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses using multiple mechanisms, including suboptimal T-cell priming, T-cell suppression and physical exclusion of immune cells from the cancer cells. In essence, they serve as myeloid checkpoints, keeping the “brakes on” and enabling tumors to evade the immune system and drive resistance to cancer therapies. Our focus is on promoting myeloid reprogramming - switching myeloid cells in the TME from an immunosuppressive state to a stimulatory state that enhances anti-tumor immunity by releasing the “brake” and allowing these myeloid cells to potentially play a pivotal role in anti-tumor activity by acting to both kill cancer cells directly as well through the recruitment and activation of tumor-directed T cells. 
We have built a portfolio of three myeloid checkpoint inhibitor product candidates, NGM707, NGM831 and NGM438, targeting four receptors whose elevated expression in myeloid cells in the TME has been associated with poor patient responses to T cell checkpoint inhibitors. NGM707, NGM831 and NGM438 are wholly-owned programs. Although all three programs were originally researched and developed under a collaboration agreement with funding from Merck, we have the sole right, at our sole discretion, to independently research, develop and commercialize each of them, at our sole expense after March 2022, subject to the payment to Merck of low single-digit royalties on commercial sales of any resulting products. See “—Our Collaboration with Merck.”
NGM707: ILT2/ILT4 Dual Antagonist Antibody
Overview of NGM707
NGM707 is a novel dual antagonist monoclonal antibody that is designed to improve patient immune responses to tumors by inhibiting both Immunoglobulin-like transcript 2, or ILT2 (also known as LILRB1), and Immunoglobulin-like transcript 4, or ILT4 (also known as LILRB2). ILT2 and ILT4 are expressed on myeloid cells in the TME and are upregulated on macrophages in the TME of certain patients with cancer who are non-responders to T cell checkpoint inhibitor therapy and, therefore, may serve as T cell checkpoint inhibitor resistance mechanisms. We believe NGM707 has the potential to reprogram ILT4- and ILT2-expressing myeloid cells to shift them from a suppressive state that restricts anti-tumor immunity to a stimulatory state that may promote anti-tumor immunity. Blocking ILT2 also may reverse inhibition of ILT2-expressing lymphoid cells to further stimulate anti-tumor immune responses.
Clinical Development of NGM707 
In June 2021, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that will evaluate NGM707 as a monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. We expect to enroll approximately 180 patients in this trial. The open-label, Phase 1 portion of the trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NGM707 and to obtain preliminary evidence of any anti-

tumor activity. The Phase 1a cohort of the trial is evaluating NGM707 as a monotherapy. The Phase 1b cohort will evaluate NGM707 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Initial data from the Phase 1a portion of the trial is expected in the second half of 2022. The Phase 1 portion of the trial is expected to be followed by a Phase 2 dose-expansion in cohorts of specific tumor types.
NGM707 Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we did not own or have a license to any issued patent that covers NGM707. However, NGM707 and related compositions-of-matter and methods of use are disclosed in pending U.S. and international patent applications we have filed. Any patent that may issue from these applications or any related applications we file is expected to expire no earlier than 2041, including any patent issued in the United States, if any, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
NGM707 Competition
We believe NGM707 is the first and only candidate currently in development targeting both ILT2 and ILT4. However, there are several products in development that target either ILT4 or ILT2. We are aware of three clinical stage anti-ILT4 programs from Merck, Jounce Therapeutics, Inc., or Jounce, and Immune-Onc Therapeutics, Inc., or Immune-Onc. In September 2020, Merck presented interim findings from a Phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluating its investigational anti-ILT4 therapeutic candidate, MK-4830. Jounce is developing an anti-ILT4 monoclonal antibody, JTX-8064, and expects to have clinical data from its Phase 1 trial in 2022. Immune-Onc initiated a Phase 1 study of its anti-ILT4 therapeutic candidate, IO-108, in September 2021. OncoResponse, Inc., ImmunOS Therapeutics AG, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. and Invectys Inc. have preclinical programs targeting ILT4. Biond Biologics Ltd., or Biond, has an antagonist antibody targeting ILT2, BND-22, which has been licensed by Sanofi, and a Phase 1 trial commenced in 2021. Jounce also has a preclinical program targeting ILT2. Finally, Adanate has an antibody, ADA-01, in preclinical development targeting LILRB family receptors that may include ILT4 and ILT2.
NGM831: ILT3 Antagonist Antibody
Overview of NGM831
NGM831 is a novel antagonist antibody that is designed to block the interaction of Immunoglobulin-like transcript 3, or ILT3 (also known as LILRB4), with fibronectin, a key component of the tumor stroma, as well as other cognate ligands. The tumor stroma refers to the non-malignant, non-immune components of the tumor. ILT3 is a fibronectin-binding inhibitory immune receptor that receives signals from the extracellular matrix to directly promote myeloid cell suppression. ILT3 is expressed on a variety of immune cells including tumor-associated myeloid cells, with particularly high expression on tolerogenic dendritic cells, or DCs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2 macrophages, and high ILT3 expression is associated with poor survival. Moreover, fibronectin has been shown to be upregulated in multiple cancers and associated with tumor progression. For tumors in which both ILT3 and fibronectin are upregulated, the ILT3-fibronectin pathway may act as a stromal checkpoint to repress myeloid cell function and inhibit anti-tumor immunity. By inhibiting ILT3's interaction with fibronectin and its other ligands, we believe NGM831 has the potential to mobilize a patient's own immune system to fight tumors by shifting myeloid cells from a suppressive state to a stimulatory state and promoting anti-tumor activity. Our scientists have made discoveries related to this pathway, including the discovery of fibronectin as ILT3’s functional ligand, as described in a publication in Cancer Immunology Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.
Clinical Development of NGM831
We anticipate initiating first-in-human testing of NGM831 in patients with advanced solid tumors in the first quarter of 2022.
NGM831 Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we did not own or have a license to any issued patent that covers NGM831. However, NGM831 and related compositions-of-matter and methods of use are disclosed in pending U.S. and international patent applications we have filed. Any patent that may issue from these or related applications or any related applications we file is expected to expire no earlier than 2040, including any patent issued in the United States, if any, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
NGM831 Competition
We believe NGM831 is the only antibody being pursued clinically for the treatment of solid tumors that is intended to block the interaction of Immunoglobulin-like transcript 3, or ILT3, with fibronectin, as well as other cognate ligands. However, there are other programs that target ILT3 in the clinic. Merck, Immune-Onc and 
Table of Contents

Carbiogene Therapeutics Co. Ltd., or Carbiogene, all have clinical stage anti-ILT3 programs. Merck’s anti-ILT3 program, MK-0482, is currently in Phase 2 development. Both Immune-Onc and Carbiogene’s ILT3 programs, IO-202 and ILT3 CAR-T, are in Phase 1 development for acute myeloid leukemia. We are aware of four additional preclinical anti-ILT3 candidates in development: Biond has BND-35, Jounce has JTX-1484, and Immune-Onc has both an ILT3 CAR-T and an ILT3 bispecific under development.
NGM438: LAIR1 Antagonist Antibody
Overview of NGM438
NGM438 is a novel antagonist antibody that is designed to inhibit leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1, or LAIR1, and thereby promote anti-tumor immune responses. NGM438 has the potential to potently block the binding of all collagens to LAIR1, including tumor-derived collagens. Collagens produced by the tumor stroma are believed to bind LAIR1 to create an immuno-suppressive TME. The interaction of collagens from the tumor stroma with LAIR1 on immune cells represents a stromal checkpoint that restrains anti-tumor immune responses. Reinvigoration of these collagen-suppressed immune cells by blocking the binding of collagens to LAIR1 may address a key resistance mechanism that limits tumor responses to current immunotherapies. 
Clinical Development of NGM438 
We anticipate initiating first-in-human testing of NGM438 in patients with advanced solid tumors in the second quarter of 2022.
NGM438 Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we did not own or have a license to any issued patent that covers NGM438. However, NGM438 and related compositions-of-matter and methods of use are disclosed in pending U.S. and international patent applications we have filed. Any patent that may issue from these applications or any related applications we file is expected to expire no earlier than 2041, including any patent issued in the United States, if any, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
NGM438 Competition
We are aware of only two other anti-LAIR1 antibodies currently in development, Immune-Onc’s preclinical-stage asset, IO-106, and NextCure, Inc.'s, or NextCure's, NC525. Nextcure also has a Phase 1 product candidate in the clinic, NC410, a LAIR2 fusion protein designed to mimic the natural decoy effects of LAIR2, which binds to collagens and blocks the activity of LAIR1.
NGM120: The Potential of GDF15/GFRAL Inhibition to Treat Cancer and Cancer-Related Cachexia 
Our scientists have made several discoveries related to growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15, including identifying its cognate receptor glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like, or GFRAL. GFRAL is expressed in a specific region of the hindbrain, partially outside the blood brain barrier. Our preclinical research suggests the central role of the GDF15/GFRAL pathway in promoting tumor-associated appetite suppression, metabolic regulation and immune modulation. In vivo screening of human genes shows that GDF15 expression leads to an outsized effect on weight loss and, in animal models, elevated serum levels of GDF15 are a regulator of immune function, metabolism and feeding. In addition, elevated serum levels of GDF15 have been shown to be associated with cachexia. Evidence has shown that serum levels of GDF15 are elevated in patients across a number of tumor types and are associated with a worse prognosis in prostate, colorectal, esophageal and ovarian cancers. As a result of our identification of GFRAL, we developed novel insights into the mechanism of action of GDF15 and the structure and function of the GDF15/GFRAL interaction. 
Overview of NGM120
NGM120 is an antagonist antibody that binds GFRAL and is designed to block the effects of elevated serum levels of GDF15. We designed NGM120 as a potent, humanized monoclonal antibody inhibitor of GFRAL with the potential for once-monthly or less frequent dosing. Preclinical studies suggest that NGM120 may reduce tumor growth and improve survival in syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic tumor models.
Although NGM120 was originally researched and developed under a collaboration agreement with funding from Merck, we have the sole right, at our sole discretion, to independently research, develop and commercialize NGM120, at our sole expense after March 2022, subject to the payment to Merck of low single-digit royalties on commercial sales of any resulting products. See “—Our Collaboration with Merck.”
Clinical Development of NGM120
Table of Contents

We are currently conducting the Phase 1/2 PINNACLES clinical trial to assess NGM120’s effect on cancer and cancer-related cachexia in patients with select advanced solid tumors and metastatic pancreatic cancer. In September 2021, at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Virtual Congress, we reported preliminary findings from two Phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts of the PINNACLES trial, including a Phase 1a cohort evaluating NGM120 as a monotherapy in patients with select advanced solid tumors and a Phase 1b cohort evaluating NGM120 in combination with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The preliminary results reported at ESMO showed that NGM120 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and provided encouraging initial signals of anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. We plan to report additional data from the Phase 1a and Phase 1b cohorts of the PINNACLES trial in the second half of 2022.
We are continuing enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the ongoing PINNACLES trial. This Phase 2 portion of the PINNACLES trial is to assess NGM120 in combination with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. 
NGM120 Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we owned two issued patents in the United States, as well as one issued foreign patent covering NGM120 and related compositions-of-matter and methods of use. We also own pending patent applications covering similar subject matter in the United States and multiple jurisdictions outside of the United States. The issued patents are expected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. 
NGM120 Competition
Given the recent identification of GFRAL, we are not aware of any publicly disclosed program other than NGM120 that targets GFRAL. There are three recently initiated Phase 1 programs we are aware of that target GDF15: AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s AV-380 is in a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, Pfizer’s monoclonal antibody PF-06946860 is in Phase 1 trials in solid tumors assessing various cachexia-related measures and anti-tumor effects and CatalYm GmbH, or CatalYm, has initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of CTL-002 in Europe to explore the treatment of cancer in solid tumors. AstraZeneca also has a preclinical program, AZD8853, an antibody targeting GDF15, and CatalYm has an additional discovery program targeting the GDF-15 pathway.
The current standard of care for first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer is chemotherapy with gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel or a combination chemotherapy regimen referred to as FOLFIRINOX. No new treatments have been FDA-approved for this population since Abraxane® (paclitaxel protein bound), or Nab-paclitaxel, in 2013 and several programs have failed in Phase 3 development in recent years. We are aware of three programs in Phase 3 trials in combination with chemotherapy in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer: Novartis’ NIS793, a monoclonal antibody targeting transforming growth factor beta, or TGFβ, FibroGen Inc.’s pamrevlumab targeting connective tissue growth factor, and Novocure GmbH’s Tumor Treating Fields device. Earlier in the pipeline, over 50 therapies are in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for pancreatic cancer, spanning multiple mechanisms of action, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer vaccines, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemokine receptor antagonists.
Therapeutic Area: Retinal Diseases
Geographic Atrophy Disease Overview
Geographic atrophy, or GA, is an advanced form of age-related, dry macular degeneration characterized by progressive retinal degeneration associated with irreversible loss of vision and is a major cause of blindness for elderly patients. GA afflicts over one million patients in the United States and approximately five million patients worldwide. One in six people with GA becomes legally blind within six years of diagnosis. The decline in visual function experienced by patients with GA is typically bilateral and directly related to the progressive loss of retinal photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, and choriocapillaris in the macular, or central, region of the retina. GA disease progression, and the patient’s accompanying visual decline, can have significant consequences for the patient, which can include the inability to drive, read and perform activities of daily living, a reduction in quality of life and increased likelihood of accidents or injuries and loss of independence. Dysregulated activation of the complement system, a key component of the immune system, including complement C3, has been implicated in the onset and progression of GA. There are currently no medicines approved by the FDA or the EMA for the treatment of GA. 
NGM621: A Potential Treatment for Geographic Atrophy 
NGM621 is a proprietary humanized Immunoglobulin 1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody engineered to potently bind to, and be a long-acting inhibitor of, complement C3 activity. Human genetics and histopathological 
Table of Contents

data strongly suggest that overactivation of the complement system is linked to the development and progression of GA and causes chronic inflammation, cell injury and death of retinal photoreceptors, RPE and choriocapillaris, leading to irreversible vision loss. The evidence suggests that variants in the complement pathway account for the majority of the known genetic risk for GA. In humans, histopathological analysis of eyes afflicted with GA show a deposition of complement proteins, including C3, on and around photoreceptors and RPE cells preceding their degeneration. In addition, encouraging preclinical and clinical data support inhibition of complement C3 as a promising therapeutic strategy in GA.
Complement C3 is the most upstream point of convergence for all three main complement activation pathways, the classical, lectin and alternative pathways, and acts as a key substance to promote the complement cascade downstream activation. NGM621 inhibits complement activation at the level of C3, which affords the opportunity to block an array of potentially detrimental downstream effects. 
NGM621 is within the scope of our current collaboration with Merck, and Merck has a one-time option to license NGM621 and its related compounds upon completion of the Phase 2 CATALINA trial described below (either alone or bundled with all of the other ophthalmology compounds and their respective related compounds included within the scope of the current collaboration with Merck). See “—Our Collaboration with Merck.”
In February 2022, NGM621 received Fast Track designation from the FDA for GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration. 
Clinical Development of NGM621
NGM621 is being tested in the ongoing Phase 2 CATALINA clinical trial to evaluate its effects on disease progression in patients with GA. In 2021, we completed enrollment in the CATALINA trial, enrolling 320 patients. The CATALINA trial was designed to be a Phase 3-supportive or -enabling study. The primary objectives of this multicenter, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled trial are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NGM621 when given every four weeks or every eight weeks via IVT injections compared to sham control. Patients are randomized to one of four treatment groups in a ratio of 2:1:2:1 to receive IVT injections of NGM621 or sham every four weeks or every eight weeks for a total of 52 weeks and then monitored for an additional four weeks upon treatment completion for a total study duration of 56 weeks. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of change in GA lesion area, as measured by fundus autofluorescence imaging, over 52 weeks of treatment. The primary safety endpoints will evaluate the incidence and severity of ocular and systemic adverse events from treatment with NGM621 compared to sham control. We expect to report topline data from the CATALINA trial in the fourth quarter of 2022. We plan to use the CATALINA trial results and guidance from the FDA to inform NGM621 Phase 3 planning and design. 
Data from a Phase 1 trial we conducted showed that NGM621 was well tolerated, with no patients experiencing serious adverse events, or SAEs, drug-related adverse events, intraocular inflammation, endophthalmitis or choroidal neovascularization. Ocular adverse events observed were mild in severity and representative of those commonly associated with IVT injections. No vision-related safety signals were detected. 
NGM621 Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we owned one issued United States patent covering NGM621, and the product and related compositions-of-matter and methods of use are disclosed and claimed in other patent applications pending in the United States and in multiple jurisdictions outside of the United States. The current patent and any patent that may issue from any of the pending applications would be expected to expire no earlier than 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
Geographic Atrophy Competition
Current Treatments
There are currently no medicines approved by the FDA or the EMA for the treatment of GA. Patients with GA have very limited options outside of clinical trial participation. They are observed by their ophthalmologist or retina specialist for the purposes of documenting disease worsening, through imaging and visual acuity testing, and to monitor for any conversion to wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD (which is treatable with anti-VEGFs). Some patients with GA take AREDS formula vitamins which have been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced forms of AMD; however, results from the AREDS trials have shown that there is no benefit to reducing the rate of existing GA progression. As their vision declines, patients with GA can receive visual rehabilitation and instruction on adaptive tools, like magnifiers, to help manage their disability as well as possible.
Treatments in Development
Table of Contents

Given the large market opportunity in GA, there are multiple programs in clinical development for GA. The landscape can be subdivided into either agents targeting the complement pathway or agents targeting other pathways implicated in AMD pathogenesis and different modes of action. Most treatment approaches for GA have focused on reducing the rate of GA lesion area progression, as assessed by retinal imaging. For the complement-targeted approaches, some therapeutics focus on inhibiting key points in the complement pathway with targeted inhibitors, while others are replacing regulatory proteins that modulate the complement cascade activity. Additionally, the product administration approaches vary and include oral pills, subcutaneous injections, IVT injections and surgical approaches like gene therapy. GA is a chronic, progressive disease and, currently, many believe that slowing the progression of disease requires treatment periods of at least 12 months to show a meaningful treatment benefit relative to sham control. 
Multiple complement inhibition therapies are under clinical evaluation in patients with GA, although to date no GA treatment has received regulatory approval from the FDA or the EMA. Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Apellis, recently presented top-line results from two Phase 3 clinical trials of its product candidate, pegcetacoplan (an anti-complement C3 PEGylated peptide), in patients with GA secondary to AMD. One trial met the primary endpoint of significantly reducing GA progression at a one-year time point in the pegcetacoplan arm versus the sham arm, while the other trial did not meet its primary endpoint. Apellis reported that it plans to submit a new drug application for pegcetacoplan for GA to the FDA in the first half of 2022 that will include its statistically significant Phase 2 results as supportive of approval. IVERIC bio, Inc.’s, or IVERIC's, Zimura®, a PEGylated aptamer inhibitor of complement C5, completed a Phase 2/3 clinical trial that demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the rate of GA lesion area growth in the Zimura arm versus the sham arm. IVERIC is in a second confirmatory Phase 3 trial of Zimura and expects Phase 3 trial results in the second half of 2022. Other agents in development targeting the complement pathway include: Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s IONIS-FB-LRx, a factor B inhibitor in Phase 2 development; Hemera Biosciences, LLC’s HMR59, a gene therapy in development that produces CD59 to inhibit the complement membrane attack complex formation; Gemini Therapeutics, Inc.’s complement factor H replacement agent in Phase 2 development, GEM103; and Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings plc’s gene therapy GT-005, replacing complement factor I in patients with genetically defined GA in Phase 2 development; and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s ALXN2040 and Annexon, Inc.'s ANX007, both in Phase 2 development. 
There are multiple product candidates in development that target other pathways implicated in AMD pathogenesis, including HtrA1 inhibition (for example, RG6147 in Phase 2 development by Roche) and visual cycle modulators (for example, ALK001 in Phase 3 development by Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Additionally, there are stem cell products being developed with the potential to replace RPE cells in late-stage GA and with the intent of preserving or improving visual function (for example, OpRegen in development by Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc.; CPCB-RPE1 in development by Regenerative Patch Technologies LLC; and ASP7217 in development by Astellas Pharma Inc.).
Therapeutic Area: Liver and Metabolic Diseases
We have spent more than a decade discovering and developing a portfolio of clinical-stage drug candidates that target various forms of cardio-metabolic and liver diseases, most specifically nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We have identified multiple hormonal pathways of interest and our drug candidates stem from novel insights we have made in the regulation of cardio-metabolic processes and liver function.
NASH Disease Overview
NASH and metabolic diseases are among the largest unmet medical needs globally and represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and a significant burden for patients and healthcare systems. They also represent areas of underinvestment by the pharmaceutical industry, driven in part by the biological complexity of the diseases and the substantial costs necessary to develop new therapeutics. Metabolic syndrome is exhibited by approximately 35% of adults in the United States and comprises a constellation of co-morbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, poorly regulated lipids and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, a precursor to NASH. NAFLD is characterized by abnormal amounts of fat in the liver, a condition known as steatosis. This abnormal fat in the liver contributes to the progression in certain NAFLD patients to NASH by developing a necroinflammatory state in the liver that ultimately drives scarring, also known as fibrosis, and, for many, progresses to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. 
The estimated global prevalence of NAFLD and NASH has risen rapidly in parallel with the dramatic rise in obesity and diabetes. In the United States alone, the prevalence of NASH was estimated to total 19.3 million cases in 2020 and is expected to reach 27 million cases in the United States by 2030, with similar trends occurring globally. Patients with NASH with F2, F3 or F4 fibrosis were believed to encompass approximately 8.3 million

patients in the United States in 2020 and that number is expected to grow to 14.1 million by 2030. The population of cirrhotic patients with NASH in the United States is expected to reach 3.5 million in 2030.
In addition to living with the burden of illness, NASH with advanced fibrosis can be very expensive for patients, their families and society. Advanced liver fibrosis is generally considered fibrosis stages F3 and F4. The annual economic burden associated with NAFLD and NASH in the United States was estimated to be over $100 billion in 2016. If a patient progresses through the earlier stages of fibrosis to F4 fibrosis, or cirrhosis, there is an increased occurrence of negative liver-related outcomes, including a more than 60% risk of cirrhosis-related complications such as ascites, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeds, liver cancer or liver transplant. The median survival for a cirrhotic NASH patient is approximately seven years. 
Our NASH Product Candidates
Aldafermin
Aldafermin is an engineered analog of human hormone fibroblast growth factor 19, or FGF19, that is administered through a once-daily subcutaneous injection using a pre-filled, single-use, glass syringe. Aldafermin has demonstrated the ability to rapidly improve NASH and reverse liver fibrosis in preclinical and clinical studies. FGF19 is a highly specific and potent regulator of liver fat metabolism and bile acid synthesis that we believe is responsible for some of the beneficial effects of gastric bypass surgery on NASH. 
Aldafermin is wholly-owned by us.
Clinical Development of Aldafermin
To date, aldafermin has been dosed in over 700 patients and healthy volunteers across multiple liver and metabolic diseases, including more than 300 patients with NASH. In May 2021, we announced that the Phase 2b ALPINE 2/3 trial of aldafermin in patients with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 or 3, or F2 or F3, did not meet its primary endpoint evaluating a dose response at week 24 on liver fibrosis improvement by >1 stage with no worsening of NASH. As a result, we decided to suspend further development of aldafermin in patients with F2/F3 NASH, allowing for the reallocation of resources to advancing our other programs. 
Aldafermin remains in Phase 2b development for the treatment of patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis (liver fibrosis stage 4, or F4). The Phase 2b ALPINE 4 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the treatment effect of aldafermin over 48 weeks in a population of patients with NASH with F4 liver fibrosis and well-compensated cirrhosis. We initiated the ALPINE 4 trial in February 2020 and completed enrollment of 160 patients across 80 sites in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong and Australia in January 2022. The objective of the trial is to evaluate whether fibrosis regression can be achieved in compensated cirrhotic patients with NASH, for whom liver mortality rates are high and liver transplant is the only option. We recently updated the design of the ALPINE 4 trial, elevating the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, or ELF, test, a reproducible, quantitative non-invasive liver prognostic test that evaluates liver fibrosis and correlates to liver-related outcomes, to be the primary endpoint for the trial. The ELF test is a composite blood test measuring the presence of three biomarkers associated with liver matrix metabolism. Liver biopsy data will also be measured and reported as a secondary endpoint upon completion of the trial. We expect to report topline data from the ALPINE 4 trial in the first half of 2023.
Aldafermin has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials to date. In patients with NASH receiving various doses of aldafermin (between 0.3 mg and 6 mg) in our completed Phase 2 trials, the most common reported adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients across all four cohorts included diarrhea, headache, abdominal distension, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, constipation, frequent bowel movements, injection site bruising, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, injection site reaction, vitamin D deficiency, injection site symptoms (such as pruritus, erythema or swelling), cough, fecal color discoloration, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increase, with the majority of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. SAEs included one case of acute pancreatitis, as well as pleurisy, vertigo, headache, hypertension, cardiac arrest, chest pain, pneumonia, kidney mass, rectal bleeding and liver biopsy complication, none of which were considered related to study drug. 
In patients with NASH and stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis receiving various doses of aldafermin (between 0.3 mg and 3 mg) in the completed Phase 2b ALPINE 2/3 trial, topline results showed that the most common reported adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients across all four cohorts included diarrhea, nausea, headache, upper abdominal pain, injection site erythema, constipation and sinusitis with the majority of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. SAEs included osteoarthritis, uterine cancer, suicide attempt, small bowel obstruction, cholecystitis, cardiac hypertrophy and obesity, none of which were considered related to study drug.
Aldafermin Patent Portfolio
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2021, we owned 27 issued patents in the United States, as well as issued patents in more than 40 foreign countries, including various member states of the European Patent Office, or EPO, covering aldafermin, related compositions-of-matter and methods of use. We also own patent applications covering similar subject matter in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions including Europe. The earliest issued patents in the United States are expected to expire in 2032, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
MK-3655: An Insulin Sensitizer for the Treatment of NASH 
MK-3655, previously known as NGM313, is a long-acting agonistic antibody discovered by us that selectively activates fibroblast growth factor receptor 1c-beta-klotho, or FGFR1c/KLB, which regulates insulin sensitivity, blood glucose and liver fat and is administered every four weeks through a subcutaneous injection. We believe that MK-3655 has the potential to be a treatment for those patients with NASH with early to moderate fibrosis with or without type 2 diabetes.
In November 2018, Merck exercised its option for a license to conduct research upon, develop and commercialize MK-3655 and other FGFR1c/KLB agonists. As a result, Merck is responsible for further MK-3655 development activities. See “—Our Collaboration with Merck.” 
Clinical Development of MK-3655 
At the end of 2020, Merck initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial of MK-3655 for the treatment of patients with NASH with F2 or F3 fibrosis and is continuing to enroll patients in the trial. The trial is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial administering 50 mg, 100 mg and 300 mg doses of MK-3655 every four weeks compared to placebo for 52 weeks. Merck designed the trial to enroll approximately 320 patients across 137 sites globally. Patients receive liver biopsies to qualify for the trial and at the end of the 52-week treatment. The primary objective of the Phase 2b trial is NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks. 
In the Phase 1 and Phase 1b clinical trials we conducted, MK-3655 was generally well tolerated and data has shown the agent is capable of reducing liver fat content and improving metabolic biomarkers in obese, insulin resistant subjects with NAFLD after a single dose. In the Phase 1 trial, there were two SAEs reported in the MK-3655 treatment group, lower gastrointestinal, or GI, hemorrhage due to hemorrhoids and cholecystitis, both of which were deemed by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment with MK-3655. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and treatment-related events with the greatest proportion of subjects were GI disorders, injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, headache and increased appetite. In the Phase 1b trial, all adverse events observed during the course of the study were deemed mild, with increased appetite (12%) and injection site reaction (12%) being the only adverse events reported in at least 10% of MK-3655-treated subjects. 
MK-3655 Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2021, we owned three issued patents in the United States, which were licensed to Merck in connection with Merck's exercise of its license option for MK-3655, as well as pending patent applications in the United States and granted patents and pending patent applications in multiple jurisdictions outside of the United States covering MK-3655, related compositions-of-matter and methods of use. The earliest issued patents in the United States are expected to expire in 2035, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions.
NASH Competition
Current Treatments 
Currently, there are no therapeutic agents approved by the FDA or the EMA for the treatment of NASH. Weight loss through diet and lifestyle management is currently considered the first-line treatment strategy for NASH and is associated with improvement in liver histology and a reduction in cardiovascular and metabolic complications. However, fewer than 10% of patients are successful in achieving or maintaining at least a 10% total body weight loss that is sufficient to improve fibrosis and, therefore, require other interventions. In cases of morbid obesity, gastric bypass surgery has been successful in resolving NASH in a majority of patients; however, the effect on fibrosis improvement was less substantial and the risk of complications and expense of the surgery limit more widespread use. 
In the absence of approved products, some physicians utilize agents approved for other indications, including Vitamin E and pioglitazone; however, the evidence of their effect on NASH is modest and/or they have safety issues that limit acceptance. Given the increasing disease burden and lack of approved treatment options, the development of novel pharmacologic therapies to treat NASH is critical.

Treatments in Development 
Certain NASH drug development candidates are focused on the metabolic components of the disease, such as insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, that are associated with the inception and early stages of the disease pathology. Metabolically-oriented mechanism of action classes that have product candidates with histological proof-of-concept data include: Madrigal Therapeutic, Inc.’s resmetirom and Viking Therapeutic Inc.’s VK2809, both thyroid hormone receptor β-selective (THRβ) agonists; Novo Nordisk AS’s glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonist, semaglutide; the stearyl-CoA desaturase inhibitor aramchol from Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Inventiva SA’s pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) agonist, lanifibranor; Akero Therapeutics, Inc.’s efruxifermin and 89 Bio Inc.'s BIO89-100, both analogs of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21); and Genentech/Roche’s BFKB8488A, an FGFR1c/KLB bi-specific agonistic antibody.
Product candidates targeting various mechanisms with possible anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects are also in clinical testing for NASH. These classes of compounds have shown mixed results in meaningfully improving the fibrosis score of patients. Where fibrosis improvements have been shown, results have either been transient or not accompanied by significant improvements in other histological measures of the disease, which may reflect the difficulty in treating the disease without removing the underlying insult of lipotoxicity or the challenge of impinging on the complex process of hepatocellular death and fibrosis from collagen deposition by intervention through a single pathway. Members of the “anti-inflammatory” or “anti-fibrotic” mechanism of action classes with compounds that have histological proof-of-concept data include farnesoid X receptor, or FXR, agonists, such as Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s, or Intercept’s, obeticholic acid. A new drug application for obeticholic acid was filed with the FDA by Intercept in September 2019 and received a complete response letter in June 2020. In December 2021, Intercept withdrew its marketing authorization application from the EMA. Intercept has indicated that it is in the process of generating additional efficacy and safety data and that it intends to resubmit its new drug application for obeticholic acid. 
An ongoing consideration in NASH clinical development is pursuing combination treatments in an attempt to combine agents with less than optimal activity on their own to achieve a more clinically meaningful result. Combinations currently being evaluated in proof-of-concept trials include: metabolic/anti-fibrotic combinations such as semaglutide/cilofexor/firsocostat and tropifexor/licogliflozin (FXR agonist/SGLT-2, both from Novartis AG) and anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrotic duos such as cenicriviroc/tropifexor.
Our Collaboration with Merck
Collaboration Overview
In 2015, we entered into a research collaboration, product development and license agreement with Merck, which, together with amendments made prior to June 30, 2021, is referred to as the Original Collaboration Agreement, covering the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies across a range of therapeutic areas, including a broad, multi-year drug discovery and early development program financially supported by Merck, but scientifically directed by us with input from Merck. The original research phase of the collaboration was for five years and was extended for an additional two years by Merck through March 2022. Under the Original Collaboration Agreement, upon the completion of each proof-of-concept clinical trial under the program, Merck would have a one-time option to obtain a worldwide, exclusive license to the product candidate tested in the trial and compounds related to it, referred to as a License Option. If Merck exercised a License Option and paid the applicable option exercise fee, then it would be solely responsible for any further development and commercialization activities for the licensed compounds and we would have the option, when a licensed compound has advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials, to receive milestones and royalty payments or, in certain cases, to co-fund development and participate in a global cost and profit share arrangement of up to 50%, with an additional option to co-detail any such licensed compounds in the United States. If Merck did not exercise a License Option within the specified time period, then we would be free to develop and commercialize the product candidate tested in the proof-of-concept trial and its related compounds independently or with third-party partners, subject to an obligation to make low single-digit royalty payments to Merck. 
Under the terms of the Original Collaboration Agreement, Merck paid us an upfront cash licensing fee of $94.0 million, purchased approximately $106.0 million of our Series E convertible preferred stock, and reimbursed us for approximately $427.9 million of research and development expenses that we incurred over the first six years of the collaboration under the Original Collaboration Agreement. In addition, in November 2018, Merck exercised its License Option under the Original Collaboration Agreement for MK-3655 (and its related compounds). Merck is currently conducting a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind study of MK-3655 in patients with NASH with F2 or F3 liver fibrosis.
Table of Contents

On June 30, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated research collaboration, product development and license agreement with Merck, or the Amended Collaboration Agreement, replacing the Original Collaboration Agreement and extending the research phase of the collaboration, but with a narrower scope than in the Original Collaboration Agreement. Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, the collaboration is focused primarily on the identification, research and development of collaboration compounds directed to targets of interest to Merck in the fields of ophthalmology and cardiovascular or metabolic, or CVM, disease, including heart failure. The ophthalmology compounds in the collaboration include NGM621 (and its related compounds) and compounds directed against two other undisclosed ophthalmology targets (and their related compounds). The collaboration scope also includes certain laboratory testing and other activities on compounds that are directed to one of up to two undisclosed targets outside of the fields of ophthalmology and CVM disease, or the Lab Programs. 
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, Merck continues to have a License Option to each continuing collaboration compound (and its related compounds); the specific License Option exercise point and the fees to be paid upon exercise of each License Option are described below. For each program for which Merck exercises its License Option, Merck is responsible, at its own cost, for any further development and commercialization activities for the licensed compounds and we have the option, when a licensed compound has advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials, to receive milestones and royalty payments or, in certain cases, to co-fund development and participate in a global cost and profit share arrangement of up to 50%. The parties’ rights and obligations remain the same with respect to MK-3655 and its related FGFR1c/KLB agonists. 
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, Merck is providing significantly more limited annual research and development funding beginning in 2022 and we have certain obligations to conduct research and development related to collaboration compounds that will not be reimbursed by Merck. 
As a result of entering into the Amended Collaboration Agreement, we have the right to independently research, develop and commercialize all the clinical, preclinical and research assets that we researched or developed under the Original Collaboration Agreement that are now outside the narrower scope of the collaboration, including NGM707, NGM831, NGM438 and NGM120, subject to the payment to Merck of low single-digit royalties on commercial sales of any resulting products. We also have full rights to all future programs we pursue that fall outside of the scope of the specific therapeutic areas and programs included in Amended Collaboration Agreement.
Description of Amended Collaboration Agreement
The Original Collaboration Agreement contemplated an initial five-year term for the research and early development phase of the collaboration, which was extended for two additional years through March 16, 2022 by Merck’s exercise of an extension option. Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, the research and early development phase for the ophthalmology programs will continue until March 31, 2024 unless Merck exercises the Bundle Option described below, in which case it will end shortly after Merck exercises the Bundle Option, a decision which is expected to occur in late 2022 or early 2023. The research phase for the CVM-related programs will also continue until March 31, 2024, unless the parties mutually agree to extend the research phase to March 31, 2026. New CVM-related programs may be added to the collaboration if recommended by us and selected by Merck. The research phase for the Lab Programs will end no later than December 31, 2022. 
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, Merck is providing an aggregate of approximately $125.0 million in research and development funding through March 31, 2024. This includes up to $86.0 million in research and development funding for the four calendar quarters ending March 31, 2022. We were obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to expend $35.0 million of such $86.0 million in funding on programs of interest to Merck remaining in the scope of the collaboration during such four calendar quarters and we were permitted to use the remainder of the $86 million in funding provided by Merck during such four calendar quarters to advance those product candidates from the Original Collaboration Agreement for which Merck’s License Option was terminated upon entry into the Amended Collaboration Agreement. 
For the period starting on April 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, Merck will provide up to $20.0 million of research and development funding for the ophthalmology programs (other than NGM621), the CVM-related programs and the Lab Programs. If the parties mutually agree to extend the research phase for the CVM-related programs from March 31, 2024 to March 31, 2026, then Merck will provide up to a total of $20.0 million in research and development funding during the additional two years of the CVM program research phase. Merck will also fund certain research and development costs related to NGM621 in an amount expected to be up to approximately $20.0 million, until the earlier of Merck's decision to exercise, or not to exercise, its License Option with respect to NGM621 alone or as part of the Bundle Option or, March 31, 2024. 
In addition, we have certain obligations to conduct research and development related to collaboration compounds that will not be reimbursed by Merck. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to 
Table of Contents

research and develop a specific product candidate directed to an ophthalmology target to be ready by March 31, 2023 for starting investigational new drug application-, or IND-, enabling studies, and we are responsible for the cost of such work after March 2022. We will have additional research and development funding obligations under the collaboration of up to $5.0 million or $15.0 million in the event that Merck, as described in greater detail below, exercises its License Option to NGM621 alone or bundled with the other continuing ophthalmology compounds, respectively, and pays us the applicable option exercise fee. We also may spend more than the amounts we will be reimbursed by Merck for activities related to collaboration compounds, including certain NGM621 costs necessary to avoid delays in Phase 3 readiness.
During the three-month period before the end of the research and early development phase for the ophthalmology programs and the research phase for the CVM-related programs, Merck has the right to review the product candidates from each applicable program and to elect to have research and development activities continue on them under the collaboration for an additional period, referred to as a Tail Period. If Merck makes such an election, then the applicable Tail Period will begin at the end of the research, or research and early development, phase for the applicable program and will end on the earlier of achievement of the License Option exercise point or three years, except that in certain circumstances a Tail Period may continue beyond three years if the License Option exercise point has not been achieved by such time. Merck may elect for us to conduct research and early development on ophthalmology programs during the applicable Tail Period, if any, with funding from Merck that is significantly reduced from Merck’s funding levels during the research and early development phase. Alternatively, Merck may conduct such work itself or engage third-party contractors to do so, in each case at Merck’s expense. All research and development work on CVM-related programs during the applicable Tail Period, if any, will be conducted by Merck or its third-party contractors at Merck’s expense. Each Lab Program will enter a Tail Period if Merck elects to continue work on it after we complete specified laboratory and other activities.
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement, Merck retains License Options to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license, on specified terms, to each collaboration compound (and its related compounds) that remains within the scope of the continuing collaboration. Merck generally has a one-time right to exercise its License Option for any product candidate when we or Merck achieve the specified License Option exercise point. The License Option exercise point for collaboration compounds that are directed to ophthalmology targets, including NGM621 (and its related compounds) and all of the collaboration compounds from two other ophthalmology programs directed against undisclosed ophthalmology targets (and their related compounds), is after the completion of the first proof-of-concept clinical trial for such collaboration compound. In addition, upon the completion of the first proof-of-concept clinical trial for NGM621, Merck will have an additional one-time option to license all of the ophthalmology collaboration compounds together, referred to as the Bundle Option, even though no product candidate from the two other ophthalmology programs is expected to have completed human proof-of-concept trials at such time. If Merck does not exercise this one-time Bundle Option for all of the ophthalmology collaboration compounds, it may nevertheless exercise its regular License Option with respect to NGM621 (and its related compounds) at such time, and it may also exercise its regular License Option for each of the other two ophthalmology programs if a collaboration compound from such program completes a human proof-of-concept trial. If Merck exercises the Bundle Option, it will pay us an option exercise fee of either $40.0 million or $45.0 million, depending upon the stage of development of one of the two earlier-stage ophthalmology programs included in the Bundle Option. If Merck does not exercise the Bundle Option, Merck may nevertheless exercise its regular License Option with respect to NGM621 (and its related compounds) at such time, in which case it will pay us an option exercise fee of $20.0 million, and when a product candidate from either of the other two ophthalmology programs completes a human proof-of-concept trial, Merck may exercise its License Option for such product candidate (and its related compounds) and pay a $20.0 million option exercise fee upon each such exercise. 
The License Option exercise point for a collaboration compound from the CVM-related programs or the Lab Programs will be the designation by Merck of such collaboration compound as a research program development candidate that Merck intends to progress into preclinical development. Upon Merck’s exercise of a License Option for any CVM-related program or Lab Program, Merck will pay us an option exercise fee of $6.0 million and we will be eligible to receive a milestone payment of $10.0 million if Merck subsequently completes a proof-of-concept trial for a product candidate from such program. 
If Merck exercises its License Option to a product candidate and its related compounds, referred to as a Licensed Program, we will have the option to receive milestones and royalty payments or, in certain cases, prior to Merck initiating any Phase 3 clinical trial of such licensed compound, to co-fund development and participate in a global cost and profit share arrangement of up to 50%, with an additional option to co-detail any such licensed compound in the United States. If we do not elect to exercise our cost and profit share option for a particular licensed compound, we are eligible to receive an aggregate of up to $469.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of specific clinical development and regulatory events, commercial milestone payments of up to 
Table of Contents

$125.0 million and royalties from low-double digit to mid-teen percentages of worldwide net sales of such licensed compound.
Merck will be responsible, at its own cost, for all development and commercialization of product candidates from each Licensed Program, subject to our options to cost and profit share worldwide, and to co-detail those compounds in the United States as described above. If Merck does not exercise its License Option with respect to a particular candidate and its related compounds within the applicable time period, in most instances we retain all rights to research, develop and commercialize that candidate and those compounds on a worldwide basis, either alone or in partnership with a third party, subject to the payment to Merck of low single-digit royalties on commercial sales of any resulting products. 
Under the Amended Collaboration Agreement we also granted Merck a worldwide, exclusive right to conduct research and development on, and to manufacture, use and commercialize, small molecule compounds identified or developed by Merck that have specified activity against any target that we are researching or developing under the research phase of the collaboration. Merck’s research license for its own small molecule program will become non-exclusive if Merck does not exercise its option to a product candidate against a target at its option exercise point, but Merck will retain an exclusive license to any small molecule compounds that it has already identified and developed. Merck has sole responsibility for research and development of any of these small molecule compounds, at its own cost. We are eligible to receive milestone and royalty payments on small molecule compounds that are developed by Merck under such a license from us. 
In addition to the options and exclusive licenses that we granted or are obligated to grant to Merck, we have the following exclusivity obligations to Merck under the Amended Collaboration Agreement. During the applicable research phase and Tail Period, if any, for the ophthalmology programs, CVM-related programs and Lab Programs, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of our collaboration with Merck, any product with specified activity against any target that is being researched or developed under the applicable programs and, if Merck exercises its License Option for a program, we may not directly or indirectly research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any product with specified activity against the target that is the subject of that Licensed Program for so long as Merck’s license to it remains in effect. In addition, we are prohibited from directly or indirectly researching, developing or commercializing any product for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, during the research phase for the CVM-related programs.
After the research phase, Merck may terminate the overall Amended Collaboration Agreement for convenience upon written notice. Subject to certain limitations, Merck may partially terminate the Amended Collaboration Agreement for convenience as it relates to any Licensed Program or any of its rights to research and develop small molecule compounds. 
Either we or Merck may terminate the Amended Collaboration Agreement with respect to a specific Licensed Program or any particular licensed small molecule compound if the other party is in material breach of its obligations regarding that specific program and fails to cure the breach within the specified cure period. If Merck terminates a Licensed Program as a result of our uncured material breach, then we would lose our option to participate in a global cost and profit share if not yet exercised as of the time of termination and lose our co-detailing option (whether or not exercised as of that time) for candidates arising from the relevant Licensed Program. If Merck terminates a licensed small molecule compound program for our uncured material breach, we would continue to receive the full amount of milestones and royalties we were otherwise eligible for with respect to the relevant small molecule compounds. 
If we terminate a Licensed Program for uncured breach, or if Merck terminates for convenience, all licenses granted to Merck with respect to such program will terminate and Merck will assign to us all related regulatory filings and approvals and grant us an exclusive license under Merck’s intellectual property related to the terminated program, subject to the payment of a modest royalty back to Merck. 
If Merck terminates for convenience, or we terminate for such breach by Merck, all licenses to Merck with respect to the relevant small molecule compound terminate, but Merck retains all interest in and to the actual small molecule compound it had developed. 
If we undergo any change in control, Merck has the right to terminate the Amended Collaboration Agreement, in its entirety, or only with respect to certain of the research programs then being pursued. If our change in control involves another pharmaceutical company with significant annual sales of pharmaceutical products, Merck would have certain additional rights that could only be exercised within the first year following such change in control, including, but are not limited to limiting our right to cost and profit share and terminating our co-detailing rights. 
Table of Contents

If our acquirer is, at the time of the change of control, pursuing research, development, commercialization or manufacturing of, or otherwise has any rights to, any compounds that modulate a target that is the subject of a Licensed Program, Merck also has certain rights, unless our acquirer elects to cease those research, development and commercialization activities, including but not limited to terminating our co-detailing rights with respect to the relevant compounds and restrictions on the information we receive from Merck with respect to the compounds. However, our rights to share in costs and profits with respect to any such compounds, if exercised, would remain in effect, as would any milestone or royalty payment obligations of Merck with respect to the compounds. 
In addition, if our acquirer is, at the time of the change in control, researching, developing, manufacturing or otherwise has rights to any compounds that modulate a target that is also being actively pursued under our research and early development program, and which has not reached the proof-of-concept study stage but is ready for preclinical development, Merck has the right to require us to either provide information demonstrating that the competing program does not actually modulate the relevant target in the same manner as our candidate, contribute the competing program to our collaboration with Merck or divest the competing program. 
Equity Investment by Merck 
Concurrently with the execution of our Original Collaboration Agreement with Merck, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Merck for the purchase of 8,833,333 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $106.0 million. In addition, concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering in April 2019, we issued 4,121,683 shares of our common stock to Merck in a private placement at a price of $16.00 per share for proceeds of $65.9 million. Merck owned approximately 16.6% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2021. 
Manufacturing
We do not own, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently use third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations or contract manufacturing organizations, which we refer to collectively as CMOs, to manufacture and supply all of the raw materials, drug substances and drug products for our research and development programs, including all the clinical trial materials used in the clinical trials of our clinical-stage product candidates. We have established relationships with several CMOs, including Lonza Ltd and Biotechpharma UAB. The activities of our CMOs are overseen by an experienced group of employees and third-party consultants. 
We plan to continue to rely on CMOs to manufacture commercial quantities of any products for which we successfully obtain regulatory approval, as well as to provide packaging, storage and distribution of any approved products. We have not entered into long-term clinical or commercial supply agreements with any of our CMOs. In addition, each of our product candidates relies on a single contract manufacturer for supplies of its drug substance and drug product.  
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Although we believe that we hold a strong position in research in certain areas of cancer, retinal diseases and liver and metabolic diseases, our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. Smaller or earlier-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are their efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, and reliability.
There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be competitive to our products. A number of pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Allergan, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi and Takeda, as well as large and small biotechnology companies such as 89Bio, Akero, Albireo, Alentis, Amgen, Apellis, Ascletis, Axcella, AVEO, Biond, Bird Rock, Can-Fite, CatalYm GmbH, Cirius, Enanta, Galectin, Galmed, Genfit, Gilead, Glympse, Immune-Onc, ImmunOS, Immuron, Intercept, Inventiva, Iveric, Jounce, Madrigal, MannKind, MediciNova, Mirum, Nalpropion, NextCure, North Sea, Promethera, Salix, Scholar Rock, Seal Rock, Terns, Tiziana, Tizona, Viking and Vivus, are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that we are targeting. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of cancer, retinal diseases and liver and metabolic diseases will increase.

For example, Apellis recently reported that it plans to submit a new drug application for pegcetacoplan for GA to the FDA in the first half of 2022. Many of these and other existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we have and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products or for other products that would compete with our product candidates. In addition, other technologies or products may be developed that have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing the intended purposes of our products, which might render our technology and products noncompetitive or obsolete. 
For more information regarding the competition that our disclosed product candidates face, or may face, see the discussion of specific competition for each product candidate see “—Key Therapeutic Areas and Pipeline Programs.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. 
We seek to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover our product candidates, their compositions-of-matter, their methods of use and the processes for their manufacture and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the success of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and, in addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we may file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial. 
As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio includes over 500 patents and applications, including over 50 issued U.S. patents and over 30 pending U.S. patent applications covering our product candidates, certain aspects of our proprietary technology, and related inventions and improvements. Our patent portfolio also includes over 400 patents and patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States that, in many cases, are counterparts to our U.S. patents and patent applications. For more information regarding the patents and patent applications relating to our seven most advanced product candidates, see the discussion of intellectual property protection for each product candidate in “—Key Therapeutic Areas and Pipeline Programs.” The patent landscape surrounding our product candidates is crowded, and we do not know if our pending patent applications will be issued with the claims we are seeking or if our issued patents will withstand challenges from third parties. 
Not all patent applications result in the issuance of patents. Patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially longer, so public disclosure of discoveries via the publication of patent applications or in the scientific literature is often delayed. As a result, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our patent applications and may be subject to claims of priority from third parties or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, against which we will need to defend ourselves.
In addition, the scope of claims that may be allowed in any granted patent may be significantly reduced from the coverage claimed in the initial patent application. Further, the scope of the claims in an issued patent may be reinterpreted and, in some cases, narrowed or even cancelled after issuance by courts upon review. In addition, many jurisdictions allow third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings that may result in further narrowing or cancellation of patent claims. As a result, even issued patents may not provide sufficient protection from competitors.
When patents are issued, the term of each individual patent will depend on the legal term for patents in the countries in which it is granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. The actual term of any patent that may issue from the above-described patent applications claiming one of our product candidates could be longer than described above due to patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if available, or shorter if we are required to file terminal disclaimers. 
Any changes we make to the composition, formulation, method of delivery or other attributes of our current and future product candidates to cause them to have what we view as more advantageous properties may not be 
Table of Contents

covered by our existing patents and patent applications, and we may be required to file new applications and/or seek other forms of protection. 
Even if patents are issued, if a third party engages in activities covered by valid claims of our patents, we may be required to engage in enforcement actions in the courts to enforce our patents. Not all enforcement proceedings are successful. We also must take care not to infringe the valid patents of third parties. Third-party patent rights that purport to cover our product candidates or their discovery, use or manufacture may require us to challenge their validity in court or administrative proceedings and prevail in such challenges, to alter our development or commercial strategy or our product candidates or their uses and manufacture, to obtain licenses to such patents and/or to stop certain activities altogether. We hold various licenses with third parties to their intellectual property, including those with Horizon Discovery Ltd., or Horizon, and Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, described below. The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. We may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our programs and product candidates. 
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know-how, other proprietary information and continuing scientific innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. As a part of these efforts, it is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their respective relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. Although we take these and other steps to safeguard our proprietary information and trade secrets, these agreements may be breached or third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our proprietary information that is not otherwise protected by patent. 
See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property.
Licensing Arrangements 
Horizon License
In September 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Horizon, or the Horizon License, in which we obtained a non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable license to use their proprietary GS knockout CHO K1 manufacturing cell line. The Horizon License will continue for ten years and allows us to manufacture and commercialize any current or future product candidates within the contractual term, including our product candidates that are currently subject to our collaboration with Merck. 
Pursuant to the Horizon License, we paid Horizon a one-time, non-creditable and non-refundable license fee of $1.2 million, of which 50% was reimbursed by Merck. We are also subject to a license fee of $200,000 for each future strategic partner. We have the right to terminate the Horizon License upon written notice to Horizon and each party may also terminate the Horizon License in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach.
Lonza License
In October 2014, we entered into a Multi-Product License Agreement, or the Lonza License, with Lonza under which we obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license to use Lonza’s glutamine synthetase gene expression system, known as GS Xceed™, to manufacture and commercialize our proprietary products, including our product candidates that are currently subject to our collaboration with Merck. 
Pursuant to the Lonza License, we paid Lonza an upfront fee of £250,000. Upon the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial, the first Phase 3 clinical trial and the first commercial sale of any product manufactured using GS Xceed™, we are required to pay Lonza one-time milestone payments of £100,000, £100,000 and £150,000, respectively. We are also required to pay low single-digit royalties to Lonza based on net sales of any product manufactured using GS Xceed™. Our royalty obligation to Lonza continues on a product-by-product basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent or ten years after the first commercial sale of the product. We are also required to pay an annual license fee to Lonza of up to £300,000 per product if a party other than 
Table of Contents

Lonza, we, our affiliates or our strategic partners (including Merck) manufactures certain product candidates for commercial activities. We are currently required to pay this fee for MK-3655 and NGM120. In accordance with the Lonza License, for certain additional product candidates, we are instead required to pay an annual license fee to Lonza of £25,000 per product candidate prior to the initiation of clinical development, and following the initiation of clinical development, £100,000, £150,000 or £300,000 annually per product candidate, respectively, if such product candidate is in a Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trial. We are currently required to pay this fee for NGM621. 
The Lonza License continues until the expiration of the royalty term. We have the right to terminate the Lonza License upon written notice to Lonza. Each party may terminate the Lonza License for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. In addition, Lonza may terminate the Lonza License if we participate in the opposition or challenge of any Lonza patent or patent application licensed to us under the Lonza License.
Government Regulation 
Product Approval in the United States
The FDA and other regulatory health authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies and health authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative actions or judicial sanctions. These actions and sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, the market acceptance of our products and our reputation.
Preclinical and Clinical Development 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an IND product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions regarding safety or conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an institutional review board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. 
The FDA, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, which provides authorization for 
Table of Contents

whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
For purposes of biologics license application, BLA, approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
•Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These are called Phase 4 studies and may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, for biologics, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
BLA Submission and Review 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA generally makes a decision on the acceptance of the application for filing within 60 days of receipt. The FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. 
The FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, completion of other significant and time-
Table of Contents

consuming requirements related to clinical trials, and/or conduct of additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may determine that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-marketing studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Programs 
A sponsor may seek to develop and obtain approval of its product candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA review and approval of marketing applications for new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria, such as the Fast Track program, priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and Real-Time Oncology Review, or ROTR, Pilot Program. 
Fast Track Designation
The FDA Fast Track program is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of new drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that demonstrate potential to address an unmet medical need. For a Fast Track-designated product, there may be more frequent meetings and communication with the FDA, and early and frequent communication between the FDA and sponsor is encouraged throughout the entire development and review process. The FDA may consider sections of a BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The product may also be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting.
Priority Review
Generally, the FDA follows a two-tiered system of review times, standard review and priority review. For a product that receives priority review designation, the FDA has the goal of taking action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date, compared to ten months under standard review. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. A priority review designation is applicable for products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to marketed products. The FDA decides on the review designation for every application; however, an applicant may expressly request priority review. The FDA informs the applicant of a priority review designation within 60 days of the receipt of the original marketing application. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval, or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Accelerated Approval
In addition, the FDA may base accelerated approval for drugs and biologics for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug or biologic has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint. A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity 
Table of Contents

and mortality, or IMM. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept the proposed surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. Where confirmatory trials verify clinical benefit, the FDA will generally terminate the requirement. Approval of a product may be withdrawn or the labeled indication of the product changed, if trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the product, for example, if the product shows a significantly smaller magnitude or duration of benefit than was anticipated based on the observed effect on the surrogate endpoint. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval the pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of Fast Track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
Real-Time Oncology Review (ROTR) Pilot Program
The FDA has announced the availability of the RTOR pilot program for oncology product candidates that are likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted breakthrough therapy designation for the same or other indications and candidates meeting other criteria for other expedited programs, such as Fast Track and priority review. Submissions for RTOR consideration should also have straightforward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted (such as overall survival or progression free survival). Acceptance into the RTOR pilot does not guarantee or influence approvability of the application, which is subject to the usual benefit-risk evaluation by FDA reviewers, but the program allows FDA to review data earlier, before an applicant formally submits a complete application. The RTOR pilot program does not affect FDA’s PDUFA timelines.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and ROTR pilot program do not change the standards for product approval. 
Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for 
Table of Contents

the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as amended, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs and biologics that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug or biologic application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its BLA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of its marketing application if it requests such a voucher in its original marketing application and meets all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026.
Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain BLAs and certain supplements to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
A drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. 
Table of Contents

FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with FDA regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. FDA regulations also impose reporting requirements upon sponsors and their third-party manufacturers. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon sponsors and their third-party manufacturers. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon sponsors and their third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon sponsors and their third-party manufacturers. 
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in: revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and misbranding. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective actions, including corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties, including monetary penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication (or thirty days in advance of their first use if approved via the accelerated approval pathway). Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing

processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the ACA, to impose a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA. 
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. 
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on covered entities (including certain health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses, business associates and their covered subcontractors) relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA may be enforced by several federal agencies as well as state attorneys general. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Table of Contents

Our physician-administered products, once approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and would be subject to those requirements as well. 
In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
In addition, many states also govern the reporting of such payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation 
Table of Contents

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding safe working conditions, environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws and regulations may affect our future operations. 
Privacy and Data Security Laws and Compliance Obligations
We are subject to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, data privacy and security laws, regulations and other legal obligations. The regulatory framework with respect to data privacy and security is stringent and constantly evolving. For example, in addition to laws such as HIPAA that govern the processing of health information, we are or may become subject to numerous other data privacy and security laws and legal obligations, which may include laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, the European Union's, or EU’s, General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or EU GDPR and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom, or UK, law, or UK GDPR. These laws and obligations impose on subject entities extensive, costly and complex compliance obligations, which may conflict or be inconsistent with one another, and violations may result in significant fines, penalties and other adverse consequences. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” for additional information about the privacy and data security risks we may face, including in relation to the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject.
European Union Drug Development
In the EU, our future products may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
The various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are currently regulated by Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which went into effect on January 31, 2022. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States, overhauls the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU in an effort to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. 
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 Member States of the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
The EU MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to 
Table of Contents

the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in the RMS and the Concerned Member States
A MA governed by EU rules may be granted only to a Marketing Authorization Applicant, or MAA, that is established within the EEA. 
In principle, an MA has an initial validity of five years. The MA may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU member state in which the original MA was granted. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU member states may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year renewal period for the MA. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization that is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. 
In the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and must be renewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled. 
An MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” where the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. These circumstances may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the state of scientific knowledge at that time, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. An MA granted in exceptional circumstances is reserved to medicinal products intended to be authorized for treatment of rare diseases or unmet medical needs for which the applicant does not hold a complete data set that is required for the grant of a standard MA. 
Data and Market Exclusivity
The EU provides opportunities for data and market exclusivity related to MAs. Upon receiving an MA, innovative medicinal products are generally entitled to receive eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year period may, occasionally, be extended for a further year to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical/biological entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Pediatric Development
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that all MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO). The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures provided in the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. The obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived entirely by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-month extension to the Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) if any is in effect at 
Table of Contents

the time of authorization or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of orphan market exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
Where an MA is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products.
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EU member states. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. 
European Union Drug Marketing
Marketed products in the EU are subject to substantial continuing regulation, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. For example, much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must also be publicly disclosed, and agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
EU regulations applicable to marketed products exist at the regional, national and local levels, and regulations applicable at the EU level may be adopted and implemented differently by individual Member States. These regulations, and their differing implementations in Member States, increase our legal and financial compliance costs and may make some activities more time-consuming and expensive.
Before products become available to patients in the EU, they are generally subject to decisions on pricing and reimbursement by the applicable authorities in a Member State. Key criteria to determine the reimbursement status and pricing of a product may include the product’s therapeutic value, medical need, safety and cost effectiveness. Obtaining pricing and reimbursement approval of a product from a government is a time-consuming and costly process, and significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek marketing approval in the EU. Our ability to commercialize any such products successfully in the EU will depend, in part, on the outcome of these decisions. 
Regulation in the United Kingdom Following Brexit
The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is now the UK’s standalone regulator. 
Among the changes resulting from Brexit is that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. 
Brexit may influence the attractiveness of the UK as a place to conduct clinical trials. Harmonization of the current EU regulatory environment for clinical trials will increase with the entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation on January 31, 2022. It is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU. A decision by the UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that will be adopted in the EU following entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation in January 2022 may have an effect on the cost of 
Table of Contents

conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek an MA in the EU for our product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.
From January 1, 2021, an applicant for a centralized procedure MA can no longer be established in the UK. After this date, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures to obtain an MA to market products in the UK. 
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as the United Kingdom and countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Failure to comply with applicable foreign laws and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and operating restrictions.
Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations
If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Likewise, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 applies to companies that carry on all or part of their business in the UK, and prohibits bribing another person or being bribed, bribing a foreign public official with the intent to influence and obtain or retain business or an advantage, and failure by a commercial party to prevent bribery, including where the prohibited conduct or its effects occurred entirely outside the UK. 
Compliance with the FCPA and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other countries is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. 
Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is: 
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
Table of Contents

•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval. 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop. 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes in the United States have increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
Healthcare Reform 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
For example, the ACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs.
Table of Contents

There have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, former President Trump signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA remains in effect in its current form, although it may be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. Additionally, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order instructing certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is also unclear. 
We anticipate that the ACA, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. 
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. Aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013, will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
However, COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer-patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to President Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to COVID-19. 
Human Capital
Our team of talented scientists and industry professionals is the foundation of our company and fuels our historical and prospective achievements for patients. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future opportunities. As of December 31, 2021, we had 225 employees, of which approximately 147 (65%) were engaged in research and development activities, 83 hold Ph.D. and/or M.D. degrees and an additional 55 hold a masters or other post-graduate degree. Every NGM team member plays a vital role in furthering our goals and impacting our progress towards fully realizing our mission to develop transformative therapies for patients.
To succeed in our mission, we must attract, recruit, retain, develop and motivate qualified clinical, nonclinical, scientific, manufacturing, regulatory, management and other personnel needed to support our business and operations. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, we face significant competition for experienced employees from a large and diverse group of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As a result of intense recruitment efforts within biotech, we face higher turnover rates than other industries. In 2021, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated remote work for most employees, we continued to experience a higher-than-normal rate of employees leaving the company to pursue other opportunities. This turnover was mitigated by a robust recruiting

effort. We maintain a comprehensive dashboard of measurements, including recruitment productivity, diversity, equity and inclusion metrics, employee engagement scores, total rewards benchmarking, participation rates and satisfaction scores for internal training, turnover rates and exit interview results, to guide our human capital management efforts.
We believe that we can best address competitive challenges by enhancing the reputation of NGM as a great place to work, which includes nurturing our workplace culture, providing competitive compensation and benefits programs and supporting employee career development and related management training. To that end, we continue to invest resources and energy into being an employer of choice – attracting and engaging individuals who are innovative, curious, driven, diligent, collaborative and of the highest scientific integrity and ethics. Some of our key efforts in this area and management of our human capital assets generally are described here.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is to provide pay and benefits that are competitive in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry where we compete for talent. We monitor our compensation programs closely and review them throughout the year to provide what we consider a very competitive mix of compensation and health, welfare and retirement benefits for all our employees. Our compensation package for all employees includes market-competitive base salaries, annual performance bonuses and stock option grants. Our benefits programs include company sponsored medical, dental and vision health care coverage, life and AD&D insurance, a 401(k) plan with a matching employer contribution, paid time off and family leave and an employee stock purchase plan, among others benefits. Every year, we undertake a detailed review of our compensation by position and level and make adjustments necessary to ensure that we continue to provide competitive compensation. Our hiring practices and annual compensation reviews are designed to ensure fairness in pay equity across gender and ethnicity among similar roles and responsibilities throughout our organization, after accounting for legitimate business factors that can explain differences, such as performance, time at grade level, education and tenure. Our efforts extend beyond pay equity to include fairness in gender and ethnic representation at all levels in the organization.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our goal is to have a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce – not just because it is the right thing to do, but because we believe this is key to our long-term success. As of December 31, 2021, NGM employed 113 women (50%) and 112 men (50%), and 56% of our employees self-identify as non-white, including 10% that are from traditionally underrepresented groups. Our leadership, including employees at or above the vice president level and members of our board of directors, includes 41% women and 27% who self-identify as non-white. To champion our efforts in this area, we formed a cross functional team of employees to drive our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that are organized around five pillars: awareness and understanding; diverse candidate pipelines; community outreach; advocacy and career advancement; and business impact. Beginning in 2020, we have focused on anti-black racism. Our efforts have included mandatory unconscious bias and discrimination training, an employee-led diversity page on our intranet, voluntary participation in a program to encourage allyship through exercises in conjunction with Black History Month and conducting a survey to understand employee sentiment around race-related issues to establish a baseline for tracking future progress. In 2021, we implemented a pilot internship program and specific efforts to provide the company with a more diverse candidate pipeline. In addition to internal efforts, our research employees volunteered to teach elementary school students various topics in biology. We are also continuing our practice of quantifying racial, ethnic and gender diversity within completed clinical studies, and in 2021 began publishing those metrics internally and educating ourselves on industry best-practices to improve recruitment and retention of women and minorities in our clinical trials. 
Communication and Engagement
We believe that part of what sets NGM apart from other companies is our culture and, in particular, our focus on providing timely and transparent communications and creating a strong sense of belonging and inclusiveness. The COVID-19 pandemic made it unsafe for us to provide the many traditions and celebrations that contribute to what makes NGM a special place to work: monthly themed happy hours; weekly group lunch programs, often with scientific updates of interest; and events including an annual anniversary party, summer family picnic, Thanksgiving potluck and holiday white elephant party, among many others. In 2020, we shifted to a virtual setting for many employees and continued to emphasize communication and employee engagement through quarterly all-employee virtual town halls; weekly emails from the CEO through the first year of the pandemic; reflection emails from a different employee each week; regular, virtual coffee chats for small groups with our CEO and other members of senior management; our annual employee engagement survey; and company-wide virtual celebrations.

We survey our employees each year to measure their level of engagement at NGM. Our employee engagement score improved in 2021 over 2020 and affirmed that we are focusing our engagement efforts in the right areas. These surveys provide rich feedback each year that helps us to continue to grow our culture and make NGM a great place to work.
Health, Wellness and Safety
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. Early in 2020, we formed the CARE, or COVID Awareness and Re-Entry, team to handle issues related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to advising the company on matters related to compliance with federal, state and local guidance, the CARE team engages in ongoing, frequent communications with employees on matters related to personal safety – particularly for those essential workers required to work on site. We also partner with a third-party provider to administer daily symptom screenings and contact tracing, and to provide the support of medical professionals when warranted. Ongoing activities that continue to promote employee wellness include external support from our employee assistance program as well as recently added mental wellness and health advocacy services. We look forward to resuming all-employee access to our on-site gym, boot camp and other exercise-related options when conditions permit.
None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
