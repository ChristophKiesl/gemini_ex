Item 1. Business.
 A. Overview

I. | Summary

Carnival Corporation was incorporated in Panama in 1972 and Carnival plc was incorporated in England and Wales in 2000. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate a dual listed company (“DLC”), whereby the businesses of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are combined through a number of contracts and through provisions in Carnival Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Carnival plc’s Articles of Association. The two companies operate as if they are a single economic enterprise with a single senior executive management team and identical Boards of Directors, but each has retained its separate legal identity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are both public companies with separate stock exchange listings and their own shareholders. Together with their consolidated subsidiaries, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are referred to collectively in this Form 10-K as “Carnival Corporation & plc,” “our,” “us” and “we.”
We are among the largest, most profitable and financially strong leisure travel companies in the world with a market capitalization of over $38 billion at January 19, 2017. We are also the largest cruise company, carrying 48% of global cruise guests, and a leading provider of vacations to all major cruise destinations throughout the world. We operate over 100 cruise ships within a portfolio of leading global, regional and national cruise brands that sell tailored cruise products, services and vacation experiences in all the world’s most important vacation geographic areas. We believe having global and regional brands serving multiple countries and national brands tailored to serve individual countries provides us with a unique advantage when competing for consumers' discretionary vacation spending. 

II. | Vision, Goals and Related Strategies

Our vision is "Together we deliver unmatched joyful vacation experiences and breakthrough shareholder returns by exceeding guest expectations and leveraging our scale." We believe our portfolio of brands is instrumental to achieving our vision and maintaining our cruise industry leadership positions.  Our primary financial goals are to profitably grow our cruise business and increase our return on invested capital, while maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings and balance sheet.
To reach our primary financial goals, we continue to implement initiatives to create additional demand for our brands in excess of measured capacity, ultimately leading to higher revenue yields. We will continue to identify opportunities to enhance our cruise products and services and optimize our cost structure while preserving the unique identities of our individual brands. We have made significant investments in performing customer segmentation analyses and evaluating data included in our global database of guests to gain insight into their decision-making process and vacation needs enabling us to identify new marketing opportunities and further grow our share of their vacation spend. We have also implemented strategies to grow demand by increasing consumer awareness and consideration of our cruise brands and the global cruise industry through ongoing public relations efforts and advertising. 

We continue to identify and implement new strategies and tactics to strengthen our cruise ticket revenue management processes and systems across our portfolio of brands, such as optimizing our pricing methodologies and improving our pricing models. We are currently rolling-out our state-of-the-art revenue management system across six brands and expect the roll-out to be completed by early 2018. We also continue to implement initiatives to better coordinate and optimize our brands' global deployment strategies to maximize guest satisfaction and profits. Furthermore, we are implementing initiatives to strengthen our onboard revenue programs.
We are building new, innovative, purpose-built ships that are larger, more fuel efficient, have a greater number of balconies and present a wider range of onboard amenities and features. These ships further enhance the attractiveness of a cruise vacation while achieving greater economies of scale and resulting in improved returns on invested capital. As of January 19, 2017, we have a total of 19 cruise ships scheduled to be delivered between 2017 and 2022. Some of these ships will replace existing capacity as less efficient ships exit our fleet. Since 2006, we have removed 18 ships from our fleet, and our newbuild program has been designed to consider an expected acceleration in our fleet replacement cycle over time. Furthermore, we continue to make substantial investments in our existing ship enhancement programs to improve our onboard product offerings and enrich our guests’ vacation experiences.
At the forefront of innovation and our continuous efforts to enhance our cruise products and services, we recently unveiled an interactive guest experience platform developed to enable elevated service levels through enhanced guest interactions before, 
4

during and after cruise vacations. The Ocean MedallionTM and its ecosystem will enable personalized and customized guest experience on a level not previously considered possible by interacting with thousands of sensors, kiosks, interactive surfaces and smart devices.  With this innovation, from the moment our guests first engage with us, their experiences will seamlessly be powered by their preferences. The new guest experience platform will debut on Regal Princess in November 2017, followed by Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess in early 2018.
We continue to grow our presence in established markets and increase our penetration in developing markets, such as Asia. We believe that we have significant opportunities to continue to profitably grow our presence in China due to its large and growing middle-class population, expansion of its international tourism and the government's plan to support the cruise industry. Including the introduction of a Princess Cruises ship built specifically for Chinese guests in 2017, 6% of our total capacity will be deployed in China. 
With over 100 ships and more than 11.5 million guests in 2016, we have the scale to optimize our structure by utilizing our combined purchasing volumes and common technologies as well as implementing cross-brand initiatives aimed at cost containment. We have and continue to integrate certain back office functions to achieve the full benefits of our scale. Having global leaders in communications, innovation, maritime, procurement, revenue management and strategy supports collaboration and communication across our brands and helps coordinate our global efforts.
Our ability to generate significant operating cash flow allows us to internally fund our capital investments. This allows us to manage our debt level in a manner consistent with maintaining our strong credit metrics and strong investment grade credit ratings while returning free cash flow and more to our shareholders in the form of dividends and/or share buybacks. In 2016, we increased our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share from $0.30 per share. Since resuming our stock repurchase program in late 2015, we repurchased approximately 54 million shares for $2.6 billion. 
Our vision is based on four key pillars:

• | Health, environment, safety, security and sustainability


• | Guests


• | Employees


• | Shareholders and other stakeholders

Health, Environment, Safety, Security and Sustainability
We consider health, environment, safety, security and sustainability matters to be our core guiding principles. Our uncompromising commitment to the safety and comfort of our guests and crew is paramount to the success of our business. We are committed to operating a safe and reliable fleet and protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and all others working on our behalf. We continue to focus on further enhancing the safety measures onboard all of our ships. As a result of the environmental issues found on certain Princess ships, our entire fleet has re-focused and increased efforts to protect the environment in which our vessels sail and the communities in which we operate. We are dedicated to fully complying with, or exceeding, all legal and statutory requirements related to health, environment, safety, security and sustainability throughout our business.
Guests
Our goal is to consistently exceed our guests’ expectations while providing them with a wide variety of exceptional vacation experiences.  We believe that we can achieve this goal by continually focusing our efforts on helping our guests choose the cruise brand that will meet their unique needs and desires, improving their overall vacation experiences and building state-of-the-art ships with innovative onboard offerings and unequaled guest services.
5

Employees
Our goal is to recruit, develop and retain the finest shipboard and shoreside employees. A team of highly motivated and engaged employees is key to delivering vacation experiences that exceed our guests’ expectations. Understanding the critical skills that are needed for outstanding performance is crucial in order to hire and train our crew and shoreside personnel. We believe in listening to and acting upon our employees’ perspectives and ideas and use employee feedback tools to monitor and improve our progress in this area. We are a diverse organization and value and support our talented and diverse employee base. We are committed to employing people from around the world and hiring them based on the quality of their experience, skills, education and character, without regard for their identification with any group or classification of people.
Shareholders and Other Stakeholders
We value the relationships we have with our shareholders and other stakeholders, including travel agents, communities, regulatory bodies, media, creditors, insurers, shipbuilders, governments and suppliers. We believe that engaging stakeholders in a mutually beneficial manner is critical to our long-term success. As part of this effort, we believe we must continue to be an outstanding corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate. Our brands work to meet or exceed their economic, environmental, ethical and legal responsibilities.
Strong relationships with our travel agents are especially vital to our success. We continue to strengthen our relationship with the travel agent community by increasing our communication and outreach, implementing changes based on travel agent feedback and improving our educational programs to assist agents in stimulating cruise demand.
B.    Global Cruise Industry
I. Overview
The multi-night global cruise industry has grown significantly but still remains a relatively small part of the wider global vacation industry, which includes a large variety of land-based vacation alternatives around the world. Within the global vacation industry, cruise companies compete for the discretionary income spent by vacationers. A 2016 Nielsen Global Consumer Confidence Survey found that after providing for savings and living expenses, the number one global spending priority is for vacations. As a result of these and other favorable cruise industry characteristics, we believe that the global cruise industry has the opportunity to capture a greater share of consumers’ spending. 
Cruising offers a broad range of products and services to suit vacationing guests of many ages, backgrounds and interests. Cruise brands can be broadly classified as offering contemporary, premium and luxury cruise experiences. The contemporary experience typically includes cruises that last seven days or less, have a more casual ambiance and are less expensive than premium or luxury cruises. The premium experience typically includes cruises that last from seven to 14 days and appeal to those who are more affluent and older. Premium cruises emphasize quality, comfort, style and more destination-focused itineraries, and the average pricing is normally higher than contemporary cruises. The luxury experience is usually characterized by smaller vessel size, very high standards of accommodation and service, higher prices and exotic itineraries to ports that are inaccessible to larger ships. We have product and service offerings in each of these three broad classifications. Notwithstanding these classifications, there is generally overlap and competition among all cruise products and services.
II. Favorable Characteristics of the Global Cruise Industry
a. Exceptional Value Proposition
We believe the cost of a cruise vacation represents an exceptional value in comparison to alternative land-based vacations. Cruising delivers many relatively unique benefits, such as transportation to various destinations while also providing accommodations, a generous diversity of food choices and a selection of daily entertainment options for one all-inclusive, competitive price. To make cruising even more cost effective and more easily accessible to vacationers, the cruise industry typically offers a number of drive-to home ports, which enables many cruise guests to reduce their overall vacation costs by eliminating or reducing air and other transportation costs. 
b. High Guest Satisfaction Rates
Cruise guests tend to rate their overall satisfaction with a cruise vacation higher than comparable land-based hotel and resort vacations.  According to industry surveys, the cruise experience consistently exceeds expectations of repeat and first-time cruisers on a wide range of important vacation attributes, such as value and service levels. Cruising continues to receive high 
6

guest satisfaction rates because of the unique vacation experiences it offers, including visiting multiple destinations without having to pack and unpack, all-inclusive product offerings and state-of-the-art cruise ships with entertainment, relaxation and fun, all at an outstanding value. 
c. Wide Appeal
Cruising appeals to a broad range of ages and income levels. Cruising provides something for every generation, from kids’ clubs to an array of onboard entertainment designed to appeal to teens and adults. Cruising also offers transportation to a variety of destinations and a diverse range of ship types and sizes, as well as price points, to attract guests with varying tastes and income levels. To encourage first-time and repeat cruisers and better compete with other vacation alternatives the cruise industry has in the recent years refocused its marketing efforts, enhanced training of travel agents and collaborated with well-known brands and offers the following:

• Expanded entertainment options and shipboard activities | • Enhanced internet and communication capabilities 
• Flexible dining options including open-seating dining | • Beverage package options 
• Branded specialty restaurants, bars and cafés | • Money-back guarantees 

d. Positive Demand Trends

Social media has a powerful impact on consumer behavior. Technology allows people to instantly share travel experiences within their social networks. Seeing others embrace travel and experience the world in new ways inspires people to plan and book their own travel. Hence, consumers are demanding more enriched lives and personal fulfillment through experience and learning and prefer to spend money on experiences rather than on material things. While desired experiences may differ across age groups, travel spans all sectors of the population. According to TripBarometer Travel Trends 2016 published by TripAdvisor, seven in ten travelers are planning to try new travel experiences, with cruising being a popular option across all age groups. Overall, today's travelers are looking to travel in ways that are immersive, meaningful and memorable. While it is useful for the cruise industry to consider travel markets across demographic groups, the ability to identify and address target markets based on "psychographics" or attitudes that cut across demographics is even more meaningful. We believe the cruise industry is well positioned to meet the travelers' desires and has the ability to tailor experiences for each guest based on their unique wants and needs, which should foster growth for the cruise industry.
From a demographic perspective, two age groups, the Baby Boomers and the Millennial generation, have in recent years experienced trends that positively affect demand for cruising. The Baby Boomer generation, or those born between 1946 and 1964, likes to pursue an active lifestyle and has the desire and the means to travel and enjoys multi-generational cruising. The Millennial generation, or those born between 1980 and 2000, has now surpassed the size of the Baby Boomer generation and represents the fastest growing demographic segment of the vacation industry. This group expresses a strong desire to travel and share new experiences, a mindset that should continue to foster growth for the industry.
These changes in consumer behavior and demographics, along with economic growth and rise of the middle class in many emerging international markets and accompanying increase in their earning power and disposable income, will continue to drive demand for travel and the global cruise industry. These groups of consumers are becoming eager to experience the world through travel, which provides significant growth opportunity for the cruise industry within and beyond the established markets, such as North America. 
7

e. Relatively Low Penetration Levels
We believe there are large, addressable markets with low penetration rates. The 2016 annual penetration rates below were computed based on the historical number of cruise guests carried as a percentage of the total population from G.P. Wild (International Limited) (“G.P. Wild”), an independent cruise research company and internal estimates:

• | 5.2% for Australia and New Zealand


• | 3.4% for North America (United States of America (“U.S.”) and Canada)


• | 2.7% for the United Kingdom (“UK”)


• | 1.8% for continental Europe (Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal)

We believe there are also markets, such as Asia, where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling an increasing demand for cruise vacations. 
f. Ship Mobility
The mobility of cruise ships enables cruise companies to move their vessels between regions in order to maximize profitability and to meet changing demand. For example, brands can change itineraries over time in order to cater to guest tastes or as general economic or geopolitical conditions warrant. In addition, cruise companies have the flexibility to reposition capacity to areas with growing demand. We believe that this unique ability to move ships provides the cruise industry with a competitive advantage compared to other land-based vacation alternatives.

Founded in 1972, Carnival Cruise Line is one of the most recognizable brands in the cruise industry and carried over 4.7 million guests in 2016, the most of any individual cruise brand.

In addition, Carnival Cruise Line also earned "Best-Value-For-Money" in the Cruise Critic's Editors' Pick Awards for the third consecutive year. The brand's newest ship, Carnival Vista, was named by Cruise Critic as the Best New Ship for 2016. Carnival Cruise Line is scheduled to take delivery of two 3,900-passenger capacity ships, Carnival Horizon and her sister ship, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and two 5,250-passenger capacity ships in 2020 and 2022, which will be the largest in its fleet.

Seabourn, which began operations in 1988, provides the world's finest ultra-luxury cruising vacations on smaller ships that focus on highly personalized service and guest recognition. The line’s fleet of three 460-passenger and one 600-passenger ships, the youngest in the ultra-luxury segment of the cruise industry, offer spacious all-suite accommodations, award-winning gourmet dining, complimentary drinks and fine wines, unique experiences such as the Officer on Deck culinary event and shopping with the Chef excursions. Seabourn launched its newest ship, Seabourn Encore, in November 2016 and has a 600-passenger capacity ship, Seabourn Ovation, scheduled for delivery in 2018.
Seven out of the last ten years, Seabourn has been voted the “Best Small-Ship Cruise Line” by readers of Travel + Leisure. In addition, Saveur named Seabourn "Best Culinary Cruise Line" three out of the last four years by its panel of travel experts and editors. Seabourn has partnered with world-renowned American chef and restaurateur Thomas Keller to develop a selection of menu items for multiple dining venues aboard Seabourn's fleet and has introduced a new signature restaurant, The Grill by Thomas Keller. Seabourn pampers its guests with complimentary value-added extras such as Massage MomentsSM on deck and Caviar in the SurfSM beach parties. All of the Seabourn ships have a high service ratio of staff members to guest and an intimate, sociable atmosphere that has been the hallmark of the Seabourn lifestyle.
Seabourn’s ships cruise to destinations throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, the South Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand, the Americas and Antarctica, with cruises generally from seven to 14 days, along with a number of longer voyages.

P&O Cruises (UK), which began operations back in 1837, is the leading and most recognized cruise brand in the UK. P&O Cruises (UK) operates a fleet of eight premium ships and has one 5,190-passenger capacity newbuild scheduled to be delivered in 2020.

P&O Cruises (UK) delivers exceptional service, dining, exploration and entertainment uniquely tailored to British tastes. This is enhanced through partnerships with its Food Heroes, a line-up of British celebrity chefs including Marco Pierre White and James Martin. In March 2016, the line's newest ship Britannia was the location for the series finale of the award-winning UK prime time show, Saturday Night Takeaway. The 90-minute live broadcast was shot on location from Barcelona on the top deck of the ship and showcased the brand to an audience of eight million people. 
Founded in 1840, Cunard is globally renowned as operating the most famous ocean liners in the world and for offering legendary travel experiences with a heritage of iconic ships and outstanding service. Cunard has a unique and distinct position within the luxury travel market and received the coveted Travel + Leisure 2016 World's Best Award. The line operates three premium/luxury ships, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary 2 and Queen Victoria.

Most of Cunard’s cruises are from seven to 14 days with three world cruises of over 100 days. 
14

Cunard’s appeal is a combination of British elegance, exemplary service and sophistication and attracts an international mix of guests with nearly 50% of guests expected to be sourced from markets outside the UK. The brand sits in a unique space offering something no one else can; luxury on a grand scale. Guests enjoy a unique experience that celebrates the line’s British heritage including an enviable association with the British Royal Family. Her Majesty the Queen is Godmother to both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary 2. 
In 2016, Queen Mary 2 underwent one of the most significant remasterings in Cunard's modern history, with an investment of over $130 million. The remastering of the ship included the addition of new dining and lounge areas, and new and refurbished staterooms throughout and the introduction of cabins for solo travelers. The designs, whilst contemporary in feel, took inspiration from the great Cunard liners of the past, particularly the original Queen Mary.
P&O Cruises (Australia), which began cruising from Australia in 1932, is the leading cruise operator in the Australia and South Pacific region.

VI. Cruise Pricing and Payment Terms
Each of our cruise brands publishes prices for the upcoming seasons primarily through the internet, although published materials such as brochures and direct mailings are also used. Our brands have multiple pricing levels that vary by cruise line, category of cabin, ship, season, duration and itinerary. Cruise prices frequently change in a dynamic pricing environment and are impacted by a number of factors, including the number of available cabins for sale in the marketplace and the level of guest demand. Some cruise prices are increased due to higher demand. Conversely, some cruise prices are reduced through special promotions and early booking, past guest recognition and other programs. We continue to identify and implement new strategies and tactics to strengthen our cruise ticket revenue management processes and systems across our portfolio of brands, such as optimizing our pricing methodologies and improving our pricing models. We are currently rolling-out our state-of-the-art revenue management system across six brands and expect the roll-out to be completed by early 2018. We also continue to implement initiatives to better coordinate and optimize our brands' global deployment strategies to maximize guest satisfaction and profits.
Our bookings are generally taken several months in advance of the cruise departure date. Typically, the longer the cruise itinerary the further in advance the bookings are made. This lead time allows us to manage our prices in relation to demand for available cabins through the use of advanced revenue management capabilities and other initiatives, with the typical strategy of marketing our ships to fill them while achieving the highest possible overall net revenue yields. 
The cruise ticket price typically includes the following: 

• | Accommodations


• | Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues


• | Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club, and sun decks


• | Child care and supervised youth programs


• | Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs


• | Access to exclusive private islands and destinations

At times, we offer value added packages to induce ticket sales to guests and groups and to encourage advance purchase of certain onboard items. These packages are bundled with cruise tickets and sold to guests for a single price rather than as a separate package and include:

•Alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverage packages | •Internet packages 
•Shore excursions•Air packages | •Photo packages•Parking
•Specialty restaurants | •Gratuities 

Our brands’ payment terms generally require that a guest pay a deposit to confirm their reservation and then pay the balance due before the departure date. Our guests are subject to a cancellation fee if they cancel their cruise within a pre-defined period before sailing, unless they purchase a vacation protection package for the ability to obtain a refund. 
As a convenience to our guests, we offer to arrange air transportation to and from airports near the home ports of our ships. In 2016, approximately 11% of our guests purchased air transportation from us. In addition, we charter aircraft to facilitate our guests’ travel to distant locations for some of our European brands’ cruise itineraries. We also offer ground transfers from and to the airport near the ship’s home port as part of our transfer programs. 
VII. Seasonality
Our revenues from the sale of passenger tickets are seasonal. Historically, demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months. This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is earned during this period. The seasonality of our results also increases due to ships being taken out-of-service for maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak demand periods. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours’ revenue and net income is generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season. 
17

VIII. Onboard and Other Revenues
Onboard and other activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee. In 2016, we earned 25% of our revenues from onboard and other revenue activities and services not included in the cruise ticket price including the following:

• Substantially all liquor and some non-alcoholic beverage sales• Casino gaming | • Internet and communication services• Full service spas 
• Shore excursions• Gift shop sales | • Specialty restaurants• Art sales 
• Photo sales | • Laundry and dry cleaning services 

We enhance our guests’ onboard experiences and increase our onboard revenues by offering all-inclusive beverage packages, spa packages and specialty restaurants. We are also implementing initiatives to strengthen our onboard revenue programs, such as bar and casino programs. We use various marketing and promotional tools and are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting “cashless” transactions for the sale of these onboard and other products and services.  As a convenience to our guests, all our brands allow their guests to pre-book, and in most cases, pre-pay certain of their onboard and other revenue-producing activities in advance of the cruise. 
We offer a variety of shore excursions at each ship’s ports-of-call that include beach experiences, general sightseeing, cultural tours, adventure outings and local boat rides. We typically utilize local operators who provide shore excursions with guides who speak the same languages as most of our shore excursion guests. For our sailings to destinations in Alaska, shore excursions are operated by our wholly-owned company, Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, or provided by local independent operators. Fathom, the company's social impact brand, offers cruisers the option of entering the heart of a destination with residents from destination countries like the Dominican Republic on initiatives such as producing much-needed water filters, pouring concrete floors for houses, supporting a women's collective with the production of organic chocolate or teaching English to children and adults. We also offer revenue-producing activities on the private islands and port destinations that we operate that include beach bars and restaurants, water sports, cabana rentals and chair lift and surf rider attractions.
Our casinos are all owned and operated directly by us and are equipped according to the unique requirements of our brands and their guests. We offer a wide variety of slot machines and a diverse mix of both traditional and specialty table games all designed to meet the desires of our guests. We have also developed marketing and promotional arrangements with land-based casino companies in order to increase the number of casino players onboard several of our brands. The casinos are only open when our ships are at sea in international waters or when otherwise permitted by law.
In conjunction with our cruise vacations, many of our cruise brands sell pre-and post-cruise land packages of one to four days that include guided tours, hotel accommodations and related transportation services. In Alaska and the Canadian Yukon, we utilize, to a large extent, our own hotel and transportation assets. Additionally, we earn revenues from various promotional and other programs with destination retailers, parking facilities, credit card providers and other destination-based incentives. 
IX. Marketing Activities
Guest feedback and research support the development of our overall marketing and business strategies to drive demand for cruises and increase the number of first-time cruisers. Our goal is to increase the portion of consumer’s vacations targeted on cruises and grow “share of suitcaseTM” for cruising on our brands. We measure and evaluate key drivers of guest loyalty and their satisfaction with our products and services that provide valuable insights about guests’ cruise experiences. We closely monitor our net promoter scores, which reflect the likelihood that our guests will recommend our brands’ cruise products and services to friends and family. We also regularly initiate customer research studies among guests, travel agents, tour operators and others for input on business decisions that enhance our cruise products and services for our guests. 
With increasing collaboration between our brands and access to vast databases of past guest information, we continue to perform psychographic segmentation studies that allow us to better understand our guests’ needs, wants and expectations. The results of these studies shape how we communicate and market, as well as refine the booking process, overall onboard experience and post-cruise interactions. Our ability to identify the psychographic segments is a powerful differentiator, which allows us to guide guests to the right experiences with the appropriate brands and build advocates for life. In addition, we have tools and are implementing big data analytic solutions that will identify new market growth opportunities to expand our customer base.
18

We have implemented strategies to generate new demand by targeting new cruisers who typically vacation at land-based destinations. Our multi-brand marketing initiatives continue to drive increased consideration with print, TV, digital, social and field marketing elements with the goal of inspiring consumers to purchase a cruise vacation with us.  We recently created original TV programs that are airing on major networks, reaching viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks, and are designed to educate, entertain and engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures and popular global destinations. With at least 80 original episodes, the new experiential series uses compelling and authentic storytelling to share the powerful way travel by sea connects people, places and cultures around the world. Each of our brands is featured during the inaugural season.
Our brands have comprehensive marketing and advertising programs across diverse mediums to promote their products and services to vacationers and travel agents in their source areas. Each brand’s marketing activities are generally designed to reach a local region in the local language. We continue to expand our marketing efforts to attract new guests online by leveraging the reach and impact of digital marketing and social media. This helps us cultivate guests as advocates of our brands, ships, itineraries and onboard products and services. We also have blogs hosted by ship captains, cruise and entertainment directors, executive pursers and special guests. 
All of our cruise brands offer past guest recognition programs that reward repeat guests with special incentives such as reduced fares, gifts, onboard activity discounts, complimentary laundry and internet services, expedited ship embarkation and disembarkation and special onboard activities. 
X. Sales Relationships
We sell our cruises mainly through travel agents and tour operators that serve our guests in their local regions. Our individual cruise brands’ relationships with their travel agents are generally independent of each of our other brands. Our travel agent relationships are generally not exclusive and travel agents generally receive a base commission, plus the potential of additional commissions, including complimentary tour conductor cabins, based on the achievement of pre-defined sales volumes. 
Travel agents are an integral part of our long-term cruise distribution network and are critical to our success. We utilize local sales teams to motivate travel agents to support our products and services with competitive sales and pricing policies and joint marketing and advertising programs. During fiscal 2016, no controlled group of travel agencies accounted for 10% or more of our revenues. We also employ a wide variety of educational programs, including websites, seminars and videos, to train agents on our cruise brands and their products and services.
For cruises that are home ported in China, we sell cruises to our Chinese-sourced guests by chartering our ships and packaging groups of cabins to travel distributors with licenses to sell outbound travel products in China. These distributors resell the cabins to their clients and other travel agents. 
All of our brands have internet booking engines to allow travel agents to book our cruises. We also support travel agent booking capabilities through global distribution systems. All of our cruise brands have their own consumer websites that provide access to information about their products and services to users and enable their guests to quickly and easily book cruises and other products and services online. These sites interface with brands’ social networks, blogs and other social media sites, which allow them to develop greater contact and interaction with their guests before, during and after their cruise. We also employ vacation planners who support our sales initiatives by offering our guests one-on-one cruise planning expertise and other services. 
We are a customer service driven company and continue to invest in our service organization to assist travel agents and guests before, during and after their cruise. We believe that our support systems and infrastructure are among the strongest in the vacation industry. Our investment in customer service includes the development of employees, processes and systems. We continually improve our systems within the reservations and customer relationship management functions, emphasizing the continuing support and training of the travel agency community. 
19

XI. Employees
Our shipboard and shoreside employees are sourced from over 100 countries. We employ an average of 84,600 crew members, including officers, onboard the 102 ships we currently operate, which excludes employees who are on leave. Our shoreside operations have an average of 10,500 full-time and 2,100 part-time/seasonal employees, including seasonal employees of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours which significantly increases its work force during the late spring and summer months in connection with the Alaskan cruise season.  We have entered into agreements with unions covering certain employees on our ships and in our shoreside hotel and transportation operations.  The percentages of our shipboard and shoreside employees that are represented by collective bargaining agreements are 55% and 24%, respectively. We consider our employee and union relationships to be strong. 
We source our shipboard officers primarily from Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Norway. The remaining crew positions are sourced from around the world, with the largest contingent from the Philippines, Indonesia and India. We utilize a limited number of manning agencies to help locate and hire most of our shipboard employees. 
XII. Training
Our cruise brands are committed to providing appropriate hotel and marine-related training to ensure that our shipboard crew, including officers, have the knowledge and skills to properly perform their jobs. We provide a diverse range of shoreside and shipboard training for our hotel staff before and after they join our ships to further enhance their skills. Specifically, we provide bar, entertainment, guest service, housekeeping, leadership, management and restaurant training. Depending on the brand, we will also provide our hotel staff with in-depth English, German and Italian language training.  All our hotel staff also undergo extensive safety training and, depending on their position, will pursue advanced safety certifications.  We partner closely with manning agencies to help provide this training in Manila, Philippines; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Mumbai, India. 
Our goal is to be a leader in delivering high quality professional maritime training. In July 2016, we opened our new seven-acre Arison Maritime Center in Almere, Netherlands, with more than double the training capacity of our original facility. The centerpiece of the new campus is the CSMART Academy, the Center for Simulator Maritime Training. The CSMART Academy features the most advanced bridge and engine room simulator technology and equipment available with the capacity to provide annual professional training for all our deck and engineering officers. CSMART participants receive a maritime training experience that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, ethical decision making and skill development. We expect to train over 6,500 deck and engineering officers at CSMART every year. 
XIII. Information Technology
With the increasing size and sophistication of cruise ships, the technologies employed to create guest experiences and operate ships have grown ever more complex and integrated. Our global information technology model is designed to contribute to exceeding expectations of our guests, crew, shoreside employees and other stakeholders. This model is focused on supporting exceptional guest experiences while increasingly leveraging common technologies to drive process efficiency and effectiveness across our portfolio of brands. In order to achieve our goals, we are focusing on applications, connectivity, cybersecurity, infrastructure and innovation. In response to the increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks, we are striving to provide consistent protection of guest, employee and company data and develop best practices and tools to combat threats and malicious activity. 
All of our brands are actively collaborating on our global information technology solutions, standards and processes. By aligning technology planning, infrastructure and applications, we continue to maximize the business value of our information technology investments by eliminating redundancies and driving synergies across the brands while identifying and leveraging best practices and establishing common standards.
XIV. Innovation
We have successfully delivered innovation to our guests for more than four decades. Our continuous innovation with ship design allows our guests to enjoy carefully crafted experiences while effortlessly en-route to their next port-of-call. Our leading port development has opened new locations and experiences to our guests.
Our pursuit of innovation focused on delighting our guests is also the inspiration for our newly developed “Experience Platform.” The Experience Platform leverages multiple technologies that work together to transform guest experience and includes the following key elements:
20


• | Ocean Medallion - a revolutionary wearable device that enables a highly personalized vacation experience


• | Ocean Compass - a digital concierge that works in conjunction with Ocean Medallion to create the ultimate vacation experience


• | xiOS - an invisible network of interactive intelligent sensors and embedded devices mounted throughout the ship, home ports and destinations that uses a guest-centric, Internet of Things approach to enable a seamless guest experience

This year, we also launched the initial phase of our state-of-the-art revenue management system, which will help us drive incremental revenue yield over time. We are currently rolling-out the system across six brands and expect the roll-out to be completed by early 2018.
We are developing and implementing cutting-edge proprietary technology to enhance our ability to monitor and track ship nautical and technical performance in real time, including fuel consumption and emissions. 
XV. Supply Chain
We incur expenses to deliver exceptional cruise experiences to our guests. In addition, we incur significant capital expenditures for materials to support the refurbishment and enhancements of our vessels. We approach our spend strategically and look for suppliers who demonstrate the ability to help us leverage our scale in terms of cost, quality and innovation. Our largest capital investments are for the construction of new ships. We currently have agreements in place for the construction of 19 cruise ships with three shipyards. 
XVI.    Insurance

a. | General


We maintain insurance to cover a number of risks associated with owning and operating our vessels and other non-ship related risks. All such insurance policies are subject to coverage limits, exclusions and deductible levels.  Insurance premiums are dependent on our own loss experience and the general premium requirements of our insurers. We maintain certain levels of deductibles for substantially all the below-mentioned coverages. We may increase our deductibles to mitigate future premium increases. We do not carry coverage related to loss of earnings or revenues from our ships or other operations. 

b. | Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) Coverages

Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, which are mutual indemnity associations owned by ship owners. 
We are members of three P&I clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”). The IG insures directly, and through broad and established reinsurance markets, a large portion of the world’s shipping fleets.  Coverage is subject to the P&I clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage are determined by the IG. 

c. | Hull and Machinery Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of each of our ships for reasonable amounts as determined by management. The coverage for hull and machinery is provided by large and well-established international marine insurers. Insurers make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as “in class” by a classification society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”). All of our ships are routinely inspected and certified to be in class by an IACS member.

d. | War Risk Insurance

We maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as loss or damage to our vessels arising from war or war-like actions, including terrorist incidents. Items excluded from this coverage are claims arising from chemical, nuclear and biological attacks. Our primary war risk insurance coverage is provided by international marine insurers and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our two P&I clubs. Under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage, which are typical for war risk policies in the marine industry, insurers can give us seven days’ notice that the insurance policies will be cancelled. However, the policies can be reinstated at different premium rates. This gives insurers the ability to increase our premiums following events that they determine have increased their risk.
21


e. | Other Insurance

We maintain property insurance covering our shoreside assets and casualty insurance covering liabilities to third parties arising from our hotel and transportation business, shore excursion operations and shoreside operations, including our port and related commercial facilities. We also maintain workers compensation, directors and officer’s liability and other insurance coverages.
XVII. Port Destinations and Private Islands
In select geographies around the world we operate a portfolio of leading port destinations and private islands to grow demand and create relative scarcity.  This enables us to offer exceptional guest experiences. In late 2015, we opened Amber Cove in the Dominican Republic, a new destination strategically located in the central Caribbean.  We also opened a third berth in late 2015 in Cozumel’s Puerta Maya to accommodate increasing demand. In addition, to secure preferential berth access to third party ports, we coordinate across brands to negotiate berthing agreements and to ‘lock-in’ preferred access through shared agreements and commitments.
 XVIII. Sustainability
Our reputation and success depend on having sustainable and transparent operations. Our commitment and actions to keep our guests and crew members safe and comfortable, protect the environment, develop and provide opportunities for our workforce, strengthen stakeholder relations and enhance both the communities where we work as well as the port communities that our ships visit are vital to our success as a business enterprise and reflective of our core values. We strive to be a company that people want to work for and to be an exemplary global corporate citizen.
We voluntarily publish Sustainability Reports that address governance, stakeholder engagement, environmental, labor, human rights, society, product responsibility, economic and other sustainability-related issues and performance indicators. These reports, which are not incorporated in this Form 10-K but can be viewed at www.carnivalcorp.com and www.carnivalplc.com, were developed in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines established by the Global Reporting Initiative, the global standard for reporting on environmental, social and governance policies, practices and performance. We have been publishing Sustainability Reports since 2011.
In order to support our environmental strategy, all of our brands' environmental management systems are certified in accordance with ISO 14001. We have also developed a set of 2020 sustainability goals reinforcing our commitment to the environment, our guests, our employees and the communities in which we operate. Our ten goals listed below are aimed at reducing our environmental footprint while enhancing the health, safety and security of our guests and crew members and ensuring sustainable business practices across our brands and business partners:
Environmental Goals

• | Reduce intensity of carbon dioxide equivalent ("CO2e") emissions from operations by 25% by 2020 relative to our 2005 baseline


• | Continue to improve the quality of our emissions into the air by developing, deploying and operating exhaust gas cleaning systems ("EGCS") across our fleet


• | Increase usage of ship-to-shore power connection capabilities


• | Increase Advanced Wastewater Purification Systems coverage of our fleet capacity by 10 percentage points by 2020 relative to our 2014 baseline

XIX. Governmental Regulations
a.    Maritime Regulations
1. General
Our ships are regulated by numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements that govern health, environmental, safety and security matters in relation to our guests, crew and ships. These requirements change regularly, sometimes on a daily basis, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited. If we violate or fail to comply with any of these laws, regulations, treaties and other requirements we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We are committed to complying with, or exceeding, all relevant maritime requirements. 
The primary regulatory bodies that establish maritime laws and requirements applicable to our ships include:
The International Maritime Organization ("IMO"): All of our ships, and the maritime industry as a whole, are subject to the maritime safety and security regulations established by the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations', and its principal set of requirements as mandated through its International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”).
Flag States: Our ships are registered, or flagged, in The Bahamas, Bermuda, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Panama and the UK, which are also referred to as Flag States. Our ships are regulated by these Flag States through international conventions that govern health, environmental, safety and security matters in relation to our guests, crew and ships. Representatives of each Flag State conduct periodic inspections, surveys and audits to verify compliance with these requirements. 
Ship classification societies: Class certification is one of the necessary documents required for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. Our ships are subject to periodic class surveys, including dry-docking inspections, by ship classification societies to verify that our ships have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification societies and that recommended repairs have been satisfactorily completed. Dry-dock frequency is a statutory requirement mandated by SOLAS. Our ships dry-dock once or twice every five years, depending on the age of the ship.
National, regional, state and local authorities: We are subject to the decrees, directives, regulations and requirements of the European Union ("EU"), the U.S., U.S. states and more than 400 other international ports that our ships visit every year.
Port regulatory authorities (Port State Control): Our ships are also subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities, which are also referred to as Port State Control, in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor requirements applicable to each port, as well as with regional, national and international requirements.  Many countries have joined together to form regional port regulatory authorities. 
As members of CLIA, we helped to develop and have implemented policies that are intended to enhance shipboard safety throughout the cruise industry. In some cases this calls for implementing best practices, which are in excess of existing legal requirements. Further details on these and other policies can be found on www.cruising.org.
23

Our Boards of Directors have HESS Committees, which are currently each comprised of four independent directors. The principal function of the HESS Committees is to assist the boards in fulfilling their responsibility to supervise and monitor our health, environment, safety, security and sustainability related policies, programs and initiatives at sea and ashore and compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements. The HESS Committees and our management team review all significant relevant risks or exposures and associated mitigating actions. 
We are committed to implementing appropriate measures to manage identified risks effectively. As part of our commitment, we have a Chief Maritime Officer, who is a retired Vice Admiral from the U.S. Navy, to oversee our global maritime operations, including maritime quality assurance and policy, environmental compliance, shipbuilding, ship refits and research and development. To ensure that we are compliant with the legal and regulatory requirements and that these areas of our business operate in an efficient manner we:

• | Provide regular health, environmental, safety and security support, training, guidance and information to guests, employees and others working on our behalf


• | Develop and implement effective and verifiable management systems to fulfill our health, environmental, safety, sustainability and security commitments


• | Perform regular shoreside and shipboard audits and take appropriate action when deficiencies are identified


• | Report and investigate all health, environmental, safety and security incidents and take appropriate action to prevent recurrence


• | Identify those employees responsible for managing health, safety, environment, security and sustainability programs and ensure that there are clear lines of accountability


• | Identify the aspects of our business that impact the environment and continue to take appropriate action to minimize that impact

2. Maritime Safety Regulations
The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of SOLAS. To help ensure guest and crew safety, SOLAS establishes requirements for the following: 

• Vessel design | • Life-saving and other equipment 
• Structural features | • Fire protection and detection 
• Construction and materials | • Safe management and operation 
• Refurbishment standards | • Musters 
• Radio communications | 

All of our crew undergo regular safety training that meets or exceeds all international maritime regulations, including SOLAS requirements which are periodically revised. 
SOLAS requires implementation of the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for passenger vessel operators.  Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to:

• | Develop a Safety Management System (“SMS”) that includes, among other things, the adoption of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies and protecting the environment


• | Obtain a Document of Compliance (“DOC”) for the vessel operator, as well as a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) for each vessel they operate. These documents are issued by the vessel’s Flag State and evidence compliance with the SMS


• | Verify or renew DOCs and SMCs periodically in accordance with the ISM Code

We have implemented and continue to enhance policies and procedures that demonstrate our commitment to the safety of our guests and crew. These policies and procedures include the following:

• | Expansion and acceleration of the training of our bridge and engine room officers in maritime related best practices at our new CSMART Academy, the Center for Simulator Maritime Training located within our Arison Maritime Center in Almere, Netherlands


• | Further standardization of our detailed bridge and engine resource management procedures on all of our ships


• | Expansion of our existing oversight function to monitor bridge and engine room operations

24


• | Identifying and standardizing best-practice policies and procedures in health, environment, safety and security disciplines across the entire organization including on all our ships


• | Further enhancement of our processes for auditing our HESS performance throughout our operations

3. Maritime Security Regulations
Our ships are subject to numerous security requirements. These requirements include the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, which is part of SOLAS, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, which addresses U.S. port and waterway security and the U.S. Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to all of our ships that embark or disembark passengers in the U.S. These regulations include requirements as to the following: 

• | Implementation of specific security measures, including onboard installation of a ship security alert system


• | Assessment of vessel security


• | Efforts to identify and deter security threats


• | Training, drills and exercises


• | Security plans that may include guest, vehicle and baggage screening procedures, security patrols, establishment of restricted areas, personnel identification procedures, access control measures and installation of surveillance equipment


• | Establishment of procedures and policies for reporting and managing allegations of crimes

4. Maritime Environmental Regulations
We are subject to numerous international, national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and treaties that govern air emissions, waste discharges, water management and disposal, and the storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints.
As a means of managing and improving our environmental performance and compliance, we adhere to standards set by ISO, an international standard-setting body, which produces worldwide industrial and commercial standards. The environmental management systems of our brands and ships are certified in accordance with ISO 14001, the environmental management standard that was developed to help organizations manage the environmental impacts of their processes, products and services. ISO 14001 defines an approach to setting and achieving environmental objectives and targets, within a structured management framework.
i. International Regulations
The principal international convention governing marine pollution prevention and response is the IMO’s International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). 
a. Preventing and Minimizing Pollution
MARPOL includes four annexes containing requirements designed to prevent and minimize both accidental and operational pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions and sets forth specific requirements related to vessel operations, equipment, recordkeeping and reporting that are designed to prevent and minimize pollution.  All of our ships must carry an International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate and a Garbage Management Plan. The ship’s Flag State issues these certificates, which evidence their compliance with the MARPOL regulations regarding prevention of pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. Certain jurisdictions have not adopted all of these MARPOL annexes but have established various national, regional or local laws and regulations to apply to these areas. 
As noted above, MARPOL governs the prevention of pollution by oil from operational measures, as well as from accidental discharges. MARPOL requires that discharges of machinery space bilge water pass through pollution prevention equipment that separates oil from the water and monitors the discharged water to ensure that the effluent does not exceed 15 parts per million oil content.  Our ships must have oily water separators with oil content monitors installed and must maintain a record of certain engine room operations in an Oil Record Book. In addition, we have voluntarily installed redundant systems on all of our ships that monitor processed bilge water prior to discharge to ensure that it contains no more than 15 parts per million oil content. This voluntary system provides additional control to prevent improper bilge water discharges. MARPOL also requires that our ships have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans. 
25

MARPOL also governs the discharge of sewage from ships and contains regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of sewage discharge, the provision of facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage and requirements for survey and certification. 
MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships and requires the implementation of Garbage Management Plan and the maintenance of a Garbage Record Book. 
Furthermore, MARPOL addresses air emissions from vessels, establishes requirements for the prevention of air pollution from ships to reduce emissions of sulfur and nitrogen (SOx, NOx), and particulate matter. It also contains restrictions on the use of ozone depleting substances (“ODS”) and requires the recording of ODS use, equipment containing ODS and the emission of ODS.

b. Sulfur Emissions
MARPOL Annex VI addresses air emissions from vessels in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on ships. Annex VI also specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas.  Since January 2015, ships operating in a number of regions throughout the world have been required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or 0.5% (depending on the ECA), or to use alternative emission reduction methods, such as Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems ("EGCS"). Additional local and regional ECAs have come into force in 2016 and several more will take effect in 2017. 
The International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee has agreed to implement a global 0.5% sulfur cap for marine fuel beginning in January 2020. The EU Parliament and Council have also set a January 2020 implementation date for their 0.5% sulfur content fuel requirement (the "EU Sulfur Directive"). The options to comply with both the global 0.5% sulfur cap and the EU Sulfur Directive include the use of low sulfur fuel, installation of EGCS, or the use of alternative fuels.
In conjunction with an affiliate, we have been installing EGCSs on our ships. These efforts are mitigating much of the impact from the 2015 ECA requirements. However, we have, and will, incur additional EGCS operating expenses as we benefit from the use of this technology.
c. Other Ship Emission Abatement Methods
In the long-term, the cost impacts of meeting progressively lower sulfur emission requirements may be further mitigated by the favorable impact of future changes in the supply and demand balance for marine and other types of fuel, future developments of and investments in improved sulfur emission abatement technologies, the use of alternative lower cost and lower emission fuels and our continued efforts to improve the overall fuel efficiency across our fleet. Since 2007, we have achieved approximately 28% cumulative reduction in unit fuel consumption by focusing on more efficient itineraries, a wide variety of ships' system hardware and software, energy-efficiency upgrades (including hull coatings, air conditioning and engine performance improvement), creating and linking energy-savings groups across operating lines and ship's staff energy use awareness and training.
As part of our emission abatement program, we have continued our work with several local port authorities to utilize cruise ship shore power connections and have equipped 28 ships with the capability to utilize shore power technology. This technology enables our ships to use power from the local electricity provider rather than running their engines while in port to power their onboard services, and thus reducing our ship air emissions. 
26

Similarly, in an effort to extend our commitment to sustainability and to play a leading role in matters of environmental protection in the cruise industry, we are expanding our investment in the use of low carbon fuels, in particular, liquefied natural gas (“LNG”):

• | AIDA now uses an LNG hybrid barge as an ecologically friendly and flexible power supply and an alternative to shore power, while its ships are moored in the port of Hamburg, Germany


• | AIDAprima is the first cruise ship in the world that regularly uses dual-fuel engines for an energy supply with LNG while in ports on her Northern European deployment. Her sister ship AIDAperla is scheduled to be delivered in 2017 with the same technology


• | We have seven next-generation cruise ships on order that will be the first in the industry to be powered at sea by LNG. Pioneering a new era in the use of low carbon fuels, these new ships will use LNG to generate 100 percent of their power both in port and on the open sea - an innovation that will reduce exhaust emissions to help protect the environment

d. Greenhouse Gas Emissions ("GHG")
In January 2013, the IMO approved measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions of GHGs from international shipping by adopting technical and operational measures for all ships. The technical measures apply to the design of new vessels, and the operational reduction measures apply to all vessels. Operational reduction measures have been implemented through a variety of means, including a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, improved voyage planning and more frequent propeller and hull cleanings. We have established objectives within the ISO 14001 environmental management systems of each of our brands to further reduce fuel consumption rates and the resulting GHG emissions. 
In October 2016, the IMO approved the implementation of a mandatory data collection system for fuel oil consumption. This amendment will require ships of 5,000 gross tons and above to provide fuel oil consumption data to their respective flag State at the end of each calendar year, formally beginning in 2019. Flag States will then validate the data and transfer it to an IMO database. The IMO will produce an annual report with anonymous data. This is the first step taken by the IMO toward a more formal analysis of international shipping's contribution to global GHG emissions.
e. Ballast Water
As of September 8, 2017, MARPOL will also govern the discharge of ballast water from ships through the MARPOL Ballast Water Management Convention. Ballast water is seawater used to stabilize ships at sea and maintain safe operating conditions throughout a voyage. Ballast can carry a multitude of marine species. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment of ballast water prior to discharging overboard in order to avoid the transfer of marine species to new environments.
ii. U.S. Federal and State Regulations
The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships authorizes the implementation of MARPOL in the U.S. and imposes numerous requirements on our ships, as discussed above. Administrative, civil and criminal penalties may be assessed for violations. 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) established a comprehensive federal liability regime, as well as prevention and response requirements, relating to discharges of oil in U.S. waters. The major requirements include demonstrating financial responsibility up to the liability limits and having oil spill response plans in place. We have Certificates of Financial Responsibility that demonstrate our ability to meet the maximum amount of OPA 90 related liability that our ships could be subject to for removal costs and damages, such as from an oil spill or a release of a hazardous substance. Under OPA 90, owners or operators of vessels operating in U.S. waters must file Vessel Response Plans with the U.S. Coast Guard and must operate in compliance with these plans. As OPA 90 expressly allows coastal states to impose liabilities and requirements beyond those imposed under federal law, many U.S. states have enacted laws more stringent than OPA 90. Some of these state laws impose unlimited liability for oil spills and contain more stringent financial responsibility and contingency planning requirements. 
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) provides the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) with the authority to regulate commercial vessels’ incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations within the U.S. three mile territorial sea and inland waters. Pursuant to the CWA authority, the U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System was designed to minimize pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our 
27

affected ships, all of the requirements are laid out in EPA's Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) for discharges incidental to the normal operations of vessels. The VGP establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.  In addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and record-keeping. 
We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the transportation and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are generated by our ships. In general, vessel owners are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to approved disposal facilities.
The U.S. National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) was enacted in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into U.S. waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign waters. The U.S. Coast Guard adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. These requirements can be met by performing mid-ocean ballast exchange, by retaining ballast water onboard the vessel or by using environmentally sound ballast water treatment methods approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. 

Most U.S. states that border navigable waterways or sea coasts have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. 
The state of Alaska has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated Alaskan waters and sets effluent limits on others. Further, the state requires that certain discharges be reported and monitored to verify compliance with the standards established by the legislation. Environmental regimes in Alaska are more stringent than the U.S. federal requirements with regard to discharges from vessels. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters. The state of California also has environmental requirements significantly more stringent than federal requirements for water discharges and air emissions.
iii. EU Regulations
The EU has adopted a broad range of substantial environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment for European citizens. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement and a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections.
The European Commission’s (“EC”) strategy is to reduce atmospheric emissions from ships. The EC strategy seeks to implement SOx Emission Control Areas set out in MARPOL, as discussed above. 
The European Commission has also implemented regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from maritime shipping through a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) regulation, which will collect emissions data from ships over 5,000 gross tons to monitor and report their carbon emissions on all voyages to, from and between European Union ports, beginning in 2018.
5. Maritime Health Regulations
We are committed to providing a healthy environment for all of our guests and crew. We collaborate with public health inspection programs throughout the world, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. (“CDC”) and the SHIPSAN Project in the EU to ensure that development of these programs leads to enhanced health and hygiene onboard our ships. Through our collaborative efforts, we work with the authorities to develop and revise guidelines, review plans and conduct on-site inspections for all newbuilds and significant ship renovations. In addition, we continue to maintain our ships by meeting, and often exceeding, applicable public health guidelines and requirements, complying with inspections, reporting communicable illnesses and conducting regular crew training and guest education programs. 
In 2015, nearly 11 million passengers embarked on CLIA member cruise ships from U.S. ports. That year, there were ten reportable norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships departing from U.S. ports involving a total of 1,263 passengers, which represents only 0.012% of cruise passengers on CLIA member cruise ships. By contrast, the CDC reported there are approximately 20 million norovirus cases in a typical year in the U.S., or 6.3% of the U.S. population.  It is estimated that one in fifteen Americans contract the norovirus on land each year, compared to an estimated one in 12,000 cruise guests globally who report that they have contracted the norovirus on a cruise ship during an outbreak each year.  Although outbreaks of gastrointestinal 
28

illnesses on ships represent a small percentage of all outbreaks, the cruise industry has developed and implemented policies and practices to limit gastrointestinal illness onboard ships.
6. Maritime Labor Regulations
In 2006, the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor 
standards, adopted a Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (“MLC 2006”). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards and includes a broad range of requirements, such as the definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. In August 2013, MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries in which we operate.
The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, as amended, establishes minimum standards relating to training, including security training, certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers. 
b. Consumer Regulations
In most major countries where we source our guests, we are required to establish financial responsibility, such as obtaining a guarantee from a reputable insurance company to ensure that, in case of insolvency, our guests will be refunded their deposits and repatriated without additional cost if insolvency occurs after a cruise starts.  
In Australia and most of Europe, we are also obligated to honor our guests’ cruise payments made by them to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether we receive these payments.
XX. Taxation
A summary of our principal taxes and exemptions in the jurisdictions where our significant operations are located is as follows:

a. | U.S. Income Tax

We are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the business of operating cruise ships in international transportation. We also own and operate, among other businesses, the U.S. hotel and transportation business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours through U.S. corporations.
Our North American cruise ship businesses and certain ship-owning subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business within the U.S.  Depending on its itinerary, any particular ship may generate income from sources within the U.S. We believe that our U.S. source income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, to the extent derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships, is currently exempt from U.S. federal income and branch profit taxes. 
Our domestic U.S. operations, principally the hotel and transportation business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, are subject to federal and state income taxation in the U.S.

1. | Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code

In general, under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain non-U.S. corporations (such as our North American cruise ship businesses) are not subject to U.S. federal income tax or branch profits tax on U.S. source income derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide in general that a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part, (i) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which an exemption is being claimed under Section 883 (an “equivalent exemption jurisdiction”) and (ii) the foreign corporation meets a defined publicly-traded corporation stock ownership test (the “publicly-traded test”). Subsidiaries of foreign corporations that are organized in an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and meet the publicly-traded test also benefit from Section 883. We believe that Panama is an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and that Carnival Corporation currently satisfies the publicly-traded test under the regulations. Accordingly, substantially all of Carnival Corporation’s income is exempt from U.S. federal income and branch profit taxes. 
Regulations under Section 883 list certain activities that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does not consider to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, therefore, the income attributable to such activities, to the extent such income is U.S. source, does not qualify for the Section 883 exemption. Among the activities identified as not incidental are income from the 
29

sale of air transportation, transfers, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise land packages to the extent earned from sources within the U.S.

2. | Exemption Under Applicable Income Tax Treaties

We believe that the U.S. source transportation income earned by Carnival plc and its Italian resident subsidiary currently qualifies for exemption from U.S. federal income tax under applicable bilateral U.S. income tax treaties.

3. | U.S. State Income Tax

Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and certain of their subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes generally imposed on each state’s portion of the U.S. source income subject to U.S. federal income taxes. However, the state of Alaska imposes an income tax on its allocated portion of the total income of our companies doing business in Alaska and certain of their subsidiaries.

b. | UK and Australian Income Tax

Cunard, P&O Cruises (UK) and P&O Cruises (Australia) are divisions of Carnival plc and have elected to enter the UK tonnage tax under a rolling ten-year term and, accordingly, reapply every year. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on profits calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. UK corporation tax is not chargeable under the normal UK tax rules on these brands’ relevant shipping income. Relevant shipping income includes income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities.
For a company to be eligible for the regime, it must be subject to UK corporation tax and, among other matters, operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially managed in the UK. Companies within UK tonnage tax are also subject to a seafarer training requirement.
Our UK non-shipping activities that do not qualify under the UK tonnage tax regime remain subject to normal UK corporation tax. Dividends received from subsidiaries of Carnival plc doing business outside the UK are generally exempt from UK corporation tax.
P&O Cruises (Australia) and all of the other cruise ships operated internationally by Carnival plc for the cruise segment of the Australian vacation region are exempt from Australian corporation tax by virtue of the UK/Australian income tax treaty.

c. | Italian and German Income Tax

In early 2015, Costa and AIDA re-elected to enter the Italian tonnage tax regime through 2024 and can reapply for an additional ten-year period beginning in early 2025. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on shipping profits calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. 
Most of Costa’s and AIDA’s earnings that are not eligible for taxation under the Italian tonnage tax regime will be taxed at an effective tax rate of 5.5%.
Substantially all of AIDA’s earnings are exempt from German income taxes by virtue of the Germany/Italy income tax treaty.

d. | Income and Other Taxes in Asian Countries

Substantially all of our brands’ income from their international operation in Asian countries is exempt from local corporation tax by virtue of relevant income tax treaties. 

e. | Other

In addition to or in place of income taxes, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose taxes, fees and other charges based on guest counts, ship tonnage, passenger capacity or some other measure.
