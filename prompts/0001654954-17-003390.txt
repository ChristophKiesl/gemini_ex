 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 
 Overview
 
      Dolphin Digital Media, Inc. (“We”,“Dolphin” or the “Company”) is dedicated to the production of high-quality digital and motion picture content.  Dolphin Digital Studios, a division of ours, is a producer of original, high quality digital programming for online consumption and is committed to delivering premium, best-in-class entertainment and securing premiere distribution partners to maximize audience reach and commercial advertising potential.  We also seek to develop online kids clubs.
 
 On March 7, 2016, we acquired Dolphin Films, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Dolphin Films”), and a content producer of motion pictures, from Dolphin Entertainment, Inc. (“Dolphin Entertainment”), an entity wholly owned by our President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Mr. O’Dowd. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the merger whereby we acquired Dolphin Films (the “Dolphin Films Acquisition”).
 
 On May 9, 2016, we filed Articles of Amendment to our Amended Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a 1-to-20 reverse stock split, as approved by our Board of Directors and a majority of our shareholders. The reverse stock split became effective on May 10, 2016.
 
  On March 30, 2017, we completed the acquisition of 42West, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (“42West”), and an entertainment public relations agency offering talent publicity, strategic communications and entertainment content marketing (the “42West Acquisition”). As consideration in the 42West Acquisition, we paid approximately $18.7 million in shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.015 (the “Common Stock”), based on the Company’s 30-trading-day average stock price prior to the closing date of $4.61 per share (less certain working capital and closing adjustments, transaction expenses, and payments of indebtedness), plus the potential to earn up to an additional $9.3 million in shares of Common Stock. As a result, we (i) issued 1,230,280 shares of Common Stock on the closing date, (ii) will issue (a) 344,550 shares of Common Stock to certain employees within 30 days of the closing date, (b) 118,655 shares of Common Stock as bonuses during 2017 and (c) approximately 1,961,821 shares of Common Stock on January 2, 2018 and (iii) may issue approximately 1,963,126 shares of Common Stock based on the achievement of specified financial performance targets over a three-year period as set forth in the Membership Purchase Agreement (the “Consideration”). Because the 42West Acquisition was completed during 2017, the financial condition and results of operations presented herein are those of Dolphin and its subsidiaries prior to the completion of the acquisition, and do not include the financial conditions and results of operations of 42West.
  
 Leslee Dart, Amanda Lundberg and Allan Mayer, each a former owner of 42West (the “Principal Sellers”), have each entered into employment agreements with the Company and will continue as employees of the Company for a three-year term after the closing date of the 42West Acquisition. The non-executive employees of 42West are expected to be retained as well. In connection with the 42West Acquisition, on March 30, 2017, the Company entered into put agreements (the “Put Agreements”) with each of the sellers. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Put Agreements, the Company has granted the sellers the right, but not obligation, to cause the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,374,187 of their shares of Common Stock received as Consideration for a purchase price equal to $4.61 per share during certain specified exercise periods set forth in the Put Agreements up until December 2020.

Dolphin Digital Studios
 
      Dolphin Digital Studios is our digital entertainment division which creates original content to premiere online, in the form of “web series”.  Dolphin Digital Studios is instrumental in producing and distributing our web series and sourcing financing for our digital media projects.
 
 Premium online video is the largest growth sector for online advertising, with market leaders such as Yahoo!, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube and AOL making major initiatives around original programming.
 
      We target three distinct demographics for our “web series” activities:
 
  

2

 

  ●
 Tweens (roughly 9-14 years old);

  ●
 Teens and young adults (roughly 14-24 years old); and

  ●
 General market (roughly 14-49 years old).


      We expect to serve each of these demographics with different content, and we may have different distribution partners for each demographic.
 
Dolphin Films
 
 Dolphin Films is a content producer of motion pictures.  In 2016, we released our motion picture, Max Steel.  We also own the rights to several scripts that we intend to produce at a future date.
 Production
 
      Our in-house development team is continuously reviewing scripts for digital projects that are directed at one of our target demographics and that we believe we can produce within our normal planned budget range of $3.0 to $5.0 million.  Our budget typically includes costs associated with purchase of the script, production of the project and marketing of the project.  Occasionally, we also hire writers to develop a script for an idea that we have internally.   From the selection provided by our development team, our management reviews the scripts and evaluates them based on expected appeal to advertisers, talent we think we can attract, available budget for the production and available financing.  We normally purchase a variety of scripts which we hold for future use.  Not all scripts purchased will be produced.  Some scripts revert back to the writer if they are not produced during a contractually agreed upon timeframe.
 
 Once we have a stable of scripts, we present a variety of projects, based on these scripts, to online platforms such as Hulu, AOL, and Yahoo!.  The online platform will typically evaluate the project based on its estimation of potential demand, considering the genre or demographic to which they are looking to appeal.  Once a project is selected by the online platform, we enter into a distribution agreement with the online platform that outlines, among other things, our revenue share percentages (typically between 30% and 45%) and the length of time that the show will air on that online platform.  Based on agreements with the online platforms and advertisers, our management then makes the decision to “greenlight” or to approve, a project for production.
 
 Our goal is also to produce young adult and family films and our in-house development team reviews scripts for motion pictures in this genre that can be produced within a budget range of $6.0 to $9.0 million.  Our budget includes the cost of acquiring the script and producing the motion picture.  We finance our motion pictures with funds from investors and the financing from international licensing agreements for the motion picture.
 
 The production of digital projects and motion pictures is very similar.  Once management greenlights a project, the pre-production phase including the hiring of a director, talent, various crew and securing locations to film begins.   We may become signatories to certain guilds such as Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. We typically hire crew members directly, engage a production service company to provide us with, among other things, the crew, equipment and a production office or use a combination of the two alternatives.   Directors and talent are typically compensated a base amount for their work.  In addition, directors and talent who are members of various guilds may receive remuneration from “residuals” that we pay to the various guilds based on the performance of our productions in ancillary markets. To better manage our upfront production costs, we sometimes structure our agreements with talent to allow them to participate in the proceeds of the digital project or motion picture in exchange for reduced upfront fixed payments, regardless of the project’s success.
 
 The decision of where to produce the project is oftentimes based on incentive tax programs implemented by many states and foreign countries to attract film production in their jurisdictions as a means of economic development.  These incentives normally take the form of sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits or cash rebates that are calculated based on a percentage spent in the jurisdiction offering the incentive.   The pre-production phase may take several months and is critical to the success of the project.

The length of time needed to film varies by project but is typically between three and six weeks.  Once the filming is completed, the project will enter the post-production phase, which includes film and sound editing, and development of special effects, as needed.   Depending on the complexity of the work to be done, post-production may take from two to six months to complete.
 
In the last five years, we produced and distributed Cybergeddon in partnership with Anthony Zuiker, creator of CSI, Hiding, and South Beach- Fever,   and were hired to provide production services for Aim High produced by a related party in conjunction with Warner Brothers.   These productions earned various awards including two Streamy Awards.   Dolphin Films produced the motion picture, Max Steel, that was released in 2016.
 
In 2016, we entered into a co-production agreement for a new digital project showcasing favorite restaurants of NFL players throughout the country.  Pursuant to the agreement, we were responsible for financing 50% of the project’s budget and are entitled to 50% of the profits. In addition, we were responsible for (a) producing; (b) negotiating and contracting the talent; (c) securing locations; (d) preparing the production and delivery schedules; (e) identifying and securing digital distribution; (f) soliciting and negotiating advertising and sponsorships; (g) legal and business affairs and (h) managing and maintaining the production account.  The web series is still in production and we anticipate that it will be produced and available for distribution in the third quarter of 2017.
 
 Distribution
 
Our digital productions for advertiser supported video-on-demand (“AVOD”) platforms have premiered on online platforms such as Hulu and Yahoo!.  Distribution agreements with online platforms are for a limited period, typically six months.  Once the contract expires, we have the ability to distribute our productions in ancillary markets such as through home entertainment, subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) (e.g. Netflix), pay television, broadcast television, foreign and other markets.  Our ability to distribute these productions in ancillary markets is typically based on the popularity of the project during its initial online distribution.
 
Similar to distribution of digital productions described above, the economic life of motion pictures is comprised of different phases.  The motion picture is initially distributed in theaters.  A successful motion picture may remain in theaters for several months, after which we have the ability to distribute the motion picture in ancillary markets such as home entertainment, pay-per-view (“PPV”), video-on-demand (“VOD”), electronic-sell-through (“EST”), SVOD, AVOD, digital rentals, pay television, broadcast television, foreign and other markets.  Concurrent with their release in the U.S., motion pictures are generally released in Canada and may also be released in one or more other foreign markets.
 
Theatrical distribution refers to the marketing and commercial or retail exploitation of motion pictures. Typically, we enter into an agreement with a distributor to place our films in theatres for a distribution fee. Pursuant to the agreement, the distribution fee varies depending on whether we provide our own Prints and Advertising ("P&A") financing or whether the distributor finances the P&A.
 
In 2016, we obtained the P&A financing necessary for the distribution and marketing costs associated with our motion picture, Max Steel, and the film was released domestically on October 14, 2016.  The motion picture did not perform as well as expected domestically, however, we secured approximately $8.2 million in international distribution agreements.  As part of our domestic distribution arrangement, we still have the ability to derive revenues from the ancillary markets described above, although the amount of revenue derived from such channels is typically commensurate with the performance of the film in the domestic box office.
 
 Financing
 
We have financed our acquisition of the rights to certain digital projects and motion picture productions through a variety of financing structures including equity finance agreements, subscription agreements and loan and security agreements.
 
We financed our production of Max Steel using funds from investors and loans partially collateralized by licensing agreements for the exploitation of the motion picture in certain international territories.  Our distribution and marketing costs were financed through financing obtained from a lender.

Online Kids Clubs
 
Through our online kids clubs we seek to partner with various organizations to provide an online destination for entertainment and information for kids.  Through online kids club memberships, established “brands” in the children’s space seek to expand their existing online audience through the promotion of original content supplied and/or sourced by Dolphin Digital Studios.  We expect that premium entertainment offerings such as original web series, will serve to both increase audiences through positive word of mouth and to increase engagement, or length of time on site.  Furthermore, we expect that the online kids clubs will serve as a platform for sponsorship and other marketing opportunities, such as contests and sweepstakes and as strong marketing vehicles for the respective brands. We expect this will keep the brands “top of mind” for the youngest generation, and in a space (the online world) where they increasingly go.
 
We believe that online kids clubs will provide us the opportunity to capitalize on the combination of the following two consumer trends:
 
  ●
 a greater number of children under the age of 18 have access to the internet (and most “own” their own devices – e.g. laptop computers, tablets and  smartphones)

  ●
 those children who have access to the internet spend an increasing amount of time online.


Simply put, the internet has become the next generation’s “go to” destination for both entertainment and information.
 
Brands that are “offline” (those without a marketing presence over the internet) need to engage with their participants “online” (or marketed over the internet) or risk losing them altogether.  To build successful engagement with children and teenagers in the “real world” and offer them nothing (let alone an equivalent engagement opportunity) in the digital world is a tremendous lost opportunity.  For example, Little Leagues may exist for the enjoyment of children, but their websites are overwhelmingly only used by parents.  Similarly, non-profits may exist to provide enrichment and cultural opportunities for children, but their websites are seldom visited by the children they serve.
 
Additionally, our online kids clubs encourage literacy in elementary school age children.  According to various studies, high school drop-out rates have a direct, proportional correlation to 3rd grade reading proficiency. If a child is already behind in their reading proficiency after 3rd grade, they are over 4x more likely to drop out of high school (a rate which increases to 10x for minority children). In the U.S., nearly 60% of fourth graders are not reading at their grade level. Our online kids clubs offer reading activities, articles and games. It also promotes parent engagement by emailing parents and continuously messaging the importance of reading and parent involvement to achieve reading proficiency.
 
We have partnered with Scholastic Books to provide to schools sponsored by a donor, a location in the school that is transformed into a reading room (the “Reading Oasis”).  Donors may sponsor a school for $10,000 which entitles each child in the school to receive an annual online kids club membership and entitles the school to receive a Reading Oasis. The Reading Oasis provides the school with hundreds of books (K-3), colorful bean bag chairs, a reading themed carpet, book cases, a listening library, and a stereo listening center with four headphones.
 
In September 2016, we terminated, by mutual accord our 2013 agreement with United Way Worldwide pursuant to which we created an online kids club to promote the organization’s philanthropic philosophy and encourage literacy in elementary school age children. We have retained the trademark to the online kids club and will continue to operate the site.  In February 2017, we also terminated our 2012 agreement with US Youth Soccer Association, Inc. pursuant to which we created, designed and hosted the US Youth Soccer Clubhouse website.
 
We operate our online kids club activities through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Dolphin Kids Club LLC (“Dolphin Kids Club”).  Until December 2016, 25% of Dolphin Kids Club was owned by KCF Investments, LLC (“KCF”).  Our agreement with KCF encompassed kids clubs created between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 and was a “gross revenue agreement” in which we were responsible for paying all associated operating expenses. On December 29, 2016, we purchased KCF’s 25% membership interest in Dolphin Kids Club and, as a result, we are the sole member of that entity.

42West
 
  42West is an entertainment public relations agency offering talent publicity, strategic communications and entertainment content marketing. In addition, it provides brand marketing and digital marketing services. Prior to its acquisition, 42West was the largest independently-owned public relations firm in the entertainment industry. Among other benefits, we anticipate that the 42West acquisition will strengthen and complement our current digital and motion picture business, while expanding and diversifying our operations. We expect that having marketing expertise in-house will allow Dolphin to review a prospective project’s marketing potential prior to making a production commitment. Furthermore, for each project greenlit for production, a comprehensive marketing plan can potentially be created prior to the start of principal photography, allowing for relevant marketing assets to be created while filming. Therefore, we believe the marketing of Dolphin projects can begin much sooner than the delivery of a finished film or series.

 42West’s public relations and marketing professionals develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for hundreds of movies and television shows as well as for individual actors, filmmakers, recording artists, and authors.  Specifically, 42West provides services in the following areas:
 
  Talent
 
 42West focuses on creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including television and film stars, recording artists, authors, models, athletes, and theater actors. 42West’s talent roster includes Oscar- and Emmy-winning actors and Grammy-winning singers and musicians and New York Times best-selling authors.  Its services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio, network, charity, corporate liaison and event and tour support.
  Entertainment Marketing
 
 42West provides marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for productions (including theatrical films, DVD and VOD releases, television programs, and online series) as well as content producers ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. Its capabilities include worldwide studio releases, independent films, television programming and web productions.  In addition, 42West provides entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red carpet management.
 Targeted Marketing
 
42West also provides marketing and publicity services that are tailored to reach diverse audiences. Their clients include major studios and independent producers for whom they create strategic multicultural marketing campaigns and provide strategic guidance aimed at reaching diverse audiences.

 42West’s strategic communications team advises high-profile individuals and companies faced with sensitive situations or looking to raise, reposition, or rehabilitate their public profiles.  It also helps studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies.
 
 Much of the team’s activities involve orchestrating high-stakes communications campaigns in response to sensitive, complex situations. 42West also helps companies define objectives, develop messaging, create brand identities, and construct long-term strategies to achieve specific goals, as well as manage functions such as media relations or internal communications on a day-to-day basis.

 Intellectual Property
 
      We seek to protect our intellectual property through trademarks and copyright.  We currently hold three trademarks for Cybergeddon and two copyrights for each of Cybergeddon, Hiding, South Beach and Max Steel and one for Jack of all Tastes.
 Competition
 
The business in which we engage is highly competitive.  We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities.  Our primary business operations are subject to competition from other digital media and motion production companies as well as from large, well established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, and distribution and capital resources than us.  We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars.
 
Given this highly competitive business, our business model is focused on providing high-quality entertainment at a lower production budget.  We intend to achieve this by relying on innovative financial structures, partnering with well established brands for production content and lowering overhead cost structure.
 
Our newly acquired business, 42West operates in a highly competitive marketing industry. It competes against other public relations and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. 42West is widely regarded as one of the nation’s leading entertainment public relations and marketing communications agency, representing many of the world’s best loved and most acclaimed entertainment personalities and brands.
 
 Employees
 
As of April 17, 2017, we have 97 full-time employees in our operations, including 81 employees from our newly acquired business, 42West.  We believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also utilize consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional employees on a project-by-project basis in connection with the production of digital media projects or motion pictures.
 Regulatory Matters
 
Our online kids clubs programs which are aimed at elementary school age children are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection. Through our online kids clubs we may monitor and collect certain information about the child users of these forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet such as the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what website operators can present to children under the age of 13 and what information can be collected from them. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual's personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers).
 
We are also subject to state and federal work and safety laws and disclosure obligations, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state organizations.
 
 Corporate Offices
 
Our corporate headquarters is located at 2151 Le Jeune Road, Suite 150-Mezzanine, Coral Gables, Florida 33134. Our telephone number is (305) 774-0407.  We also have an office located at 10866 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 800, Los Angeles, California, 90024. 42West has offices located at 600 3rd Avenue, 23rd Floor, New York, New York, 10016 and 1840 Century Park East, Suite 700, Los Angeles, California 90067.
