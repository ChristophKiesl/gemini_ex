ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
 
NeuBase Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is a biotechnology company focused on developing next generation therapies to treat rare genetic diseases and cancers caused by mutant genes. Given that perhaps every human disease has a genetic component, we believe that our differentiated platform technology has the potential for broad impact.
 
Mutated proteins resulting from errors in deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) sequences cause many rare genetic diseases and cancer. DNA in each cell of the body is transcribed into pre-RNA, which is then processed (spliced) into mRNA which is exported into the cytoplasm of the cell and translated into protein. This is termed the “central dogma” of biology. Therefore, when errors in a DNA sequence occur, they are propagated to RNAs and can become a damaging protein.
 
The type of therapies that we are developing are termed antisense oligonucleotide therapies (“ASOs”). ASOs are short single strands of nucleic acids (traditionally thought of as single stranded ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) molecules) which will bind to defective RNA targets in cells and inhibit their ability to be translated into defective proteins.
 
We believe we are a leader in the discovery and development of the class of RNA-targeted ASO drugs called peptide nucleic acids (“PNAs”). Our proprietary gamma Peptide-nucleic acid AnTisense OLigonucleotide (“PATrOL™”) platform has the potential to provide a more efficient discovery of drug product candidates than traditional methods, potentially transforming the treatment paradigm for people affected by rare genetic diseases and cancer.
 
The PATrOL™ platform allows for a more efficient discovery of drug product candidates because of manufacturing consistency and because we are not constrained by folded regions of the target RNA molecule (secondary structures). The peptide backbone of our ASOs is rigid, and once linked together to form a series of backbone subunits, forms a single pre-organized structure. At a more detailed level, each subunit of the peptide backbone has only a single chiral center – a point in the chemical structure where the conformation of the backbone could fluctuate – and this chiral center is locked into one conformation and thus pre-organized to form only a single conformation or stereoisomer. A stereoisomer is a term used in the ASO therapeutics field to mean a string of backbone subunits (usually sugars or modified sugars) with nuclear bases attached that are linked together into a specific sequence that matches (complements) the target sequence, but because of the nature of the backbone subunits used, the drug assumes various conformations often with varying affinity for the target sequence. These stereoisomers often require a manufacturing step to purify the heterogeneous mixture of conformations into a more homogenous mixture or even a single conformation of the drug in order to obtain the hoped-for therapeutic effect. Our PNAs assume only a single conformation with any constellation of nuclear bases added to the backbone or any oligomer length. This backbone also has a neutral charge, as opposed to the negatively charged backbones of DNA and RNA. This neutral charge allows our ASO to open up RNAs which are folded upon themselves and bind to their target sequence. This potentially accelerates identification of drug candidates which have the desired activity.

In addition to the backbone conformational purity that allows for a more efficient discovery of drug product candidates, we have a kit of proprietary bi-facial or bi-specific nucleotides (traditional nucleotides only have a single binding face and thus are restricted to only binding single-stranded RNA targets), which can be used in various combinations to access RNA secondary structures (double-stranded RNA targets which are folded upon themselves) such as hairpins. This allows us to access regions of the target transcript that may be unique in secondary structure to allow enhanced selectivity for the target (mutant) RNA vs. the normal RNA. Enhanced selectivity for mutant RNAs vs. normal RNAs is critical as normal RNAs are generally required for effective functioning of the cell. These bi-specific nucleotides can potentially also target genomic loci (specific, fixed position on a chromosome where a particular gene or genetic marker is located) and microRNAs (small non-coding RNA molecule) in their double stranded form.
 
In addition to the backbone and modified nuclear bases, the platform toolkit includes linker technology which, when added to both ends of the PNAs, allow cooperative binding between individual drug molecules once they are engaged with the target RNA to form longer and more tightly bound drugs.


The final component of the platform is a chemical moiety, which is used to decorate the peptide backbone in a proprietary manner and allows the PNAs to penetrate cell membranes and distribute throughout the body when administered systemically.


This toolkit of components forms the PATrOL™ platform and allows us to manufacture genome and transcript-specific PNAs for screening against targets of interest.
 
We are currently focused on therapeutic areas in which we believe our drug candidates will provide the greatest benefit with a significant market opportunity and intend to utilize our technology to build out a pipeline of custom designed therapeutics for additional high-value disease targets. We are developing several preclinical programs using our PATrOL™ platform, including: NT0100, targeted at Huntington’s Disease (“HD”), a repeat expansion disorder; and NT0200, targeted at type 1 myotonic dystrophy (“DM1”). Preclinical studies are being conducted to evaluate both the PATrOL™ platform technology broadly, as well as our program candidates in the areas of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and we expect to report the results from those studies beginning in the first calendar quarter of 2020 and in the second calendar quarter of 2020. In addition, we plan to continue developing our emerging pipeline of other assets that target primary and secondary RNA structure and genomic DNA, which may afford us a unique market advantage across a variety of rare diseases and oncology targets.


Using our PATrOL™ platform, we believe we can create ASOs that have distinct potential advantages over other chemical entities currently in the market or in development for gene silencing applications. These potential advantages include, among others: a backbone that has only one chiral center and thus forms only one stereoisomer; the ability of the PNA backbone to intercalate (insert into), open up secondary (RNA folded upon itself) and tertiary structures (RNA molecules that interact with other RNA molecules in the cell) and bind within these double-stranded RNAs in a highly selective manner; a proprietary set of engineered nuclear bases to increase selectivity to specific target sequences including secondary and tertiary structures that has been licensed exclusively from Carnegie Mellon University (“CMU”); technology to allow self-assembly of our small gamma peptide-nucleic acid (“gamma-PNA”) at the RNA target to increase selectivity, which has been licensed exclusively from CMU; the ability to modulate cell permeability and be broadly distributed across the body when administered systemically; the lack of innate or acquired immune responses of similar gamma-PNAs in preclinical models; and potential for low toxicity based on previous in vivo studies in rodent models. With these advantages, we believe our PATrOL™ platform-enabled therapies can potentially address a multitude of rare genetic diseases and cancer, among other indications.


Business Strategy
 
We employ a rational approach to selecting disease targets, considering many scientific, technical, business and indication-specific factors before choosing each indication. We intend to build a diverse portfolio of drugs custom-designed to treat a variety of health conditions, with an emphasis on rare genetic diseases and cancer. A key component of this strategy is continuing to improve the scientific understanding of our platform technology and programs, including how various components of our platform technology perform, and our drug candidates impact the biological processes of the target diseases, so that we can utilize this information to reduce risk in our future programs and indications. In addition, with our expertise in discovering and characterizing novel antisense drugs, we believe that our scientists can optimize the properties of our PATrOL™-enabled drug candidates for use with particular targets that we determine to be of high value.

The depth of our knowledge and expertise with gamma-PNA, bifacial nucleotides, engineered nucleotides, genetics and genomics and therapeutic development of first-in-class modalities provides potential flexibility to determine the optimal development and commercialization strategy to maximize the near and longer-term value of our drug candidates.
 
We have distinct partnering strategies that we plan to employ based on the specific drug candidate, therapeutic area expertise and resources potential partners may bring to a collaboration. For some drug candidates, we may choose to develop and, if approved, commercialize them ourselves or through our affiliates. For other drug candidates, we may form single or multi asset partnerships leveraging our partners’ global expertise and resources needed to support large commercial opportunities.
 
Industry Segment Background
 
Rare Genetic Diseases
 
Globally, there are thousands of genetic diseases, most of which lack any therapeutic options. In addition, rare genetic diseases are often particularly severe, debilitating or fatal. Traditionally, therapeutic development for each rare genetic disorder has been approached with a unique strategy, which is inefficient, as there are thousands of diseases that need treatment solutions. The collective population of people with rare diseases stands to benefit profoundly from the emergence of a scalable and modular treatment development platform that allows for a more efficient discovery of drug product candidates to address these conditions cohesively.


Mutated proteins resulting from errors in deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) sequences cause many rare genetic diseases and cancer. DNA in each cell of the body is transcribed into pre-RNA, which is then processed (spliced) into mRNA which is exported into the cytoplasm of the cell and translated into protein. This is termed the “central dogma” of biology. Therefore, when errors in a DNA sequence occur, they are propagated to RNAs and can become a damaging protein. ASOs can inactivate target RNAs before they can produce harmful proteins by binding them in a sequence-specific manner, which can potentially delay disease progression or even eliminate genetic disease symptoms. ASOs designed to target known disease-related mutant RNA sequences could potentially address any dominantly inherited genetic disease caused by a single genetic mutation. Similarly, applications in modifying splicing of pre-RNA in the nucleus of the cell could be developed to exclude damaging exons from the final mRNA product. We also believe that given the ability of PNAs to insert into double stranded DNA and RNA targets, we can potentially pursue the development of drug candidates that target these types of nucleic acid sequences uniquely.


We believe the breadth of the PATrOL™ platform gives us the ability to potentially address thousands of inherited genetic diseases. The technology may also allow us to target and inactivate gain-of-function mutations by sequestering excess transcripts, and by inactivating transcripts with change-of-function mutations in them (vs. their wild-type or normal counterparts). The technology may also allow us to address targets in recessive disease and haploinsufficiencies by altering splicing to remove damaging exons/mutations. Various fields of use are available, including in oncology by reducing expression of activated oncogenes or modifying gene regulation by targeting microRNAs, for example, in complex genetic disease where subtle gene variants predispose to downstream diseases together with environmental triggers, or potentially in genome editing.


ASO Therapies
 
ASO therapies have been in development for several decades and are largely comprised of chemically modified, short-length RNA or DNA strands, commonly known as oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA and DNA—that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. In nucleic acid molecules that have not been modified for therapeutic use, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester (“PO”) bonds. Such unmodified nucleic acid molecules are unsuitable for use as therapeutics, because they are rapidly degraded by enzymes called nucleases which are widely distributed in the human body, are rapidly cleared by the kidneys and are taken up poorly by targeted cells. The industry has employed chemical modifications of the nucleotides and PO bonds that improve the stability, biodistribution and cellular uptake of nucleic acid therapeutics.

Challenges of Historical ASOs
 
ASOs can be highly specific to a singular RNA sequence, decreasing the chance of potentially toxic off-target effects. When designed properly, ASOs target exactly one mutated RNA sequence, corresponding directly to the genetic disorder of interest. Because they are targeted selectively to one sequence, optimally constructed ASOs do not target any additional genes and thus potentially reduce the likelihood of adverse events or side effects. While they have great potential, in practice, the current generation of ASOs is constrained by several factors intrinsic to their composition, including some or all of the following factors:



● | they are not designed for optimal cell permeability, requiring them to be delivered at high concentrations or using other modalities that lead to other therapeutic and development challenges; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | they fail to demonstrate consistently broad tissue distribution throughout the body, often localizing predominantly to the liver when delivered systemically; 
● | they do not cross the blood-brain barrier, so they cannot access the central nervous system to address neurological disease without being delivered directly to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection; 
● | they can self-aggregate, leading to potential toxic accumulation of the drug and thus possible safety issues; and 
● | because natural oligonucleotides are recognized by enzymes throughout the body, they are subject to degradation before they can take effect, and thus others have had to extensively modify backbones resulting in immunological activation and challenges in manufacturing. 

Peptide Nucleic Acids and Janus Bases 
 
Details on PNAs were first published in 1991 by Peter Nielson, Michael Egholm and Ole Buchardt (Nielsen PE, Egholm M, Berg RH, Buchardt O. (1991) Sequence-selective recognition of DNA by strand displacement with a thymine-substituted polyamide. Science. 254 (5037): 1497–500). While these PNAs were shown to be able to bind nucleic acid strands in a sequence specific manner, this effect was not possible with targets comprised of both purines and pyrimidines. These first PNAs were also not water soluble, could not pass across plasma membranes, and self-aggregated, leading to potential toxic accumulation of the drug and thus possible safety issues. Based on this early data, the PNA backbone was modified at both the alpha positions to add conformational homogeneity enabling binding with mixed purine/pyrimidine natural nuclear base targets and additionally to allow water solubility. In 1996, Neil Branda, Guido Kurtz and Jean-Marie Lehn published “JANUS WEDGES: a new approach towards nucleobase-pair recognition” in the journal Chemical Communications. These bifacial nuclear bases had the potential to open a double helix and bind to both strands at a genomic locus in a “triad” motif utilizing the maximum number of Watson-Crick interactions. An issue with these early bi-facial nucleotides was that they were not uniform in their size and thus could not be used together on a peptide backbone to achieve the potential of binding both faces of an open DNA (or RNA) double helix.
PATrOL™ Technology Platform
 
Backbone technology: The PATrOLTM platform represents a next-generation gene silencing technology that we believe has the potential to significantly improve upon standard ASO techniques by combining the specificity of antisense approaches with the intracellular penetration and broad organ distribution capabilities of small molecule therapeutics. We are developing ASO therapies using our modular PATrOL™ platform. Our PATrOL™-enabled therapies act by binding to the mutant pre-RNA or messenger RNA (“mRNA”) primary sequence (or secondary or tertiary conformations) to prevent translation by ribosomes into mutant proteins or otherwise eliminate a pathogenic feature of the mutant transcript. Unlike other ASOs, which have a sugar backbone or a chemically modified sugar backbone, our PATrOL™-enabled therapies are designed with a peptide backbone. Some of the potential advantages of using a peptide backbone include:

● | the peptide backbone only has two stereoisomers (which can be selected with a single chemical modification at the chiral center), making it conformationally stable and enabling our approach to be modular by swapping in nuclear bases of interest; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the peptide backbone is of neutral charge, thus facilitating the potential to intercalate (open up and insert) into double-stranded DNA and RNA hairpins, which we believe provides a unique advantage relative to other ASO chemistry in that its enables targetable “real estate” and also allows designs based on primary sequence that are not prohibited by secondary structures; and 
● | PATrOL™-enabled drugs are pre-organized into a right-handed helical conformation which meshes with double-stranded RNA molecules (namely hairpins) and thus have a higher potential binding affinity; and 
● | PATrOL™-enabled therapeutic candidates can target tissues throughout the body (due to the proprietary active moieties coupled to the protein backbone of the PNAs as described above) and are stable in circulation due to resistance against degradation as shown in previous studies with similar gamma-PNAs (Demidov VV, Potaman VN, Frank-Kamenetskii MD, Egholm M, Buchard O, Sönnichsen SH, Nielsen PE. (1994) Stability of peptide nucleic acids in human serum and cellular extracts. Biochem Pharmacol. 48(6):1310-3; McMahon BM, Mays D, Lipsky J, Stewart JA, Fauq A, Richelson E. Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of a peptide nucleic acid after intravenous administration. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002 Apr;12(2):65-70

Targeting technology: In early preclinical studies, our PATrOL™-enabled therapeutic candidates have shown potential advantages over the existing generation of ASOs. We believe that chief among these advantages are cell permeability and broad tissue distribution which have been demonstrated in early preclinical studies. These advantages would allow our PATrOL™ therapeutic candidates to potentially address a wide range of disorders affecting various organs and tissues with systemic or local administration.
 
The chemistry that we have licensed from CMU includes proprietary modifications to the peptide backbone to include an active moiety, which has been shown to be able to deliver payloads into cells through a process that appears to be endosome-independent, termed “active translocation.” The preclinical studies that we reference, and which are the genesis of a medicinal chemistry process by the academics at CMU over the course of more than a decade of research, were published in a peer reviewed publication in 1999 by Steven Dowdy’s team (Schwarze SR, Ho A, Vocero-Akbani A and Dowdy SF. (1999) In Vivo Protein Transduction: Delivery of a Biologically Active Protein into the Mouse. 285: 1569-1572). These preclinical data describe how the active moiety can traffic a payload of 120kD not only into most tissues, but also across the blood-brain barrier and into the cell bodies of neurons through all regions of the brain. In 2006, a team at CMU was the first to couple a similar active moiety to the peptide backbone of PNAs and show penetration through cell membranes (Dragulescu-Andrasi A, Rapireddy S, He G, Bhattacharya B, Hyldig-Nielsen JJ, Zon G, Ly DH. (2006) Cell-permeable peptide nucleic acid designed to bind to the 5'-untranslated region of E-cadherin transcript induces potent and sequence-specific antisense effects. J Am Chem Soc.  128(50):16104-12.).

Nucleotide technology: With our proprietary modular technology, we are capable of designing therapies with a peptide backbone onto which are coupled natural nuclear bases. Natural nuclear bases are commercially available. The peptide backbone subunits, each coupled to the proprietary active moiety, are manufactured by us and/or our suppliers. The natural nuclear bases are then coupled to the cell-permeable peptide backbone subunit to form a “monomer.” In addition to being able to create these cell-permeable broadly distributed monomers that contain natural nuclear bases, we have licensed proprietary engineered nuclear bases (including bi-specific “Janus” bases) exclusively from CMU which can also be coupled to cell-permeable peptide backbone subunits. With these cell permeable monomers forming the basis of the platform, they can be linked together to form oligomers of any sequence composition, which can target primary RNA sequences as well as secondary RNA structures. A key attribute of the peptide backbone is that it is pre-organized chemically to form a rigid backbone (see discussion above). We believe that the modular components (i.e. the “monomers”) together with the lack of chirality in the backbone makes the platform highly scalable for manufacturing purposes, thus enabling a more efficient discovery of drug product candidates for mutant gene silencing than traditional methods.
 
We believe we are the first and only company to successfully create Janus bases, engineered nucleic acids that target double-stranded RNA and potentially DNA by engaging both strands at once. The concept of Janus bases was first conceived nearly two decades ago but had not yet been realized due to the difficulty in chemical process development and the re-engineering required to allow the bifacial bases to have equal size – key considerations in creating tightly binding triple helices (or triads). A team of scientists, including our director of chemistry, has co-invented 16 different Janus bases to interface with every possible combination of 16 canonical and non-canonical nucleobase pairs that could occur in target RNA. Janus bases can be combined in various combinations to bind in a sequence-specific manner to secondary and tertiary RNA structures, whereas traditional antisense therapies generally cannot, and thus many sequences have heretofore not been targetable. This gives us the ability to expand the applicability of antisense therapies beyond their current capabilities as our candidates are not limited to regions of RNA that are free of secondary structure and thus potentially opens up a multitude of additional sequence targets. Our approach can also potentially be utilized for DNA therapeutics, such as gene editing, gene regulation and liquid biopsy diagnostics.
 
We have licensed proprietary technology from CMU, which comprises the modular elements of the PATrOL™ platform, including gamma-PNAs with a series of backbone modifications, such as with the proprietary active moieties critical for cell permeability in combination with exclusively licensed chemically engineered bifacial nucleotides against not only canonical base pairs (A-T or C-G hydrogen bonding), but also non-canonical binding, which allows targeting of RNA hairpins where the double-stranded RNA cannot bind to itself due to a mismatch, but that mismatch can be bound and stabilized by the non-canonical bifacial nucleotide. The elegance of this approach is the combination of the non-charged peptide backbone that does not cause repulsion when near a DNA or RNA negatively charged double helix with the proprietary bifacial nucleotides of uniform size. This combination is particularly powerful at the RNA level in addressing RNA hairpins with non-canonical bases to stabilize them and potentially eliminate the ability of target transcripts to be translated. The following Figure 1 illustrates the concept of how our chemically engineered bifacial nuclear bases tethered to a peptide backbone can intercalate into the double helix of double-stranded RNA and assume a stable and sterically appropriate triple helix. The technology was developed over the course of almost a decade, and we believe it is unique to us, allowing us to target RNA secondary structures either by opening them up via our gamma-PNA technology to bind in a primary sequence-specific manner or by intercalating into secondary (or potentially even tertiary) structures, thus allowing sequence-specific selectivity of targets that have been largely not addressable to competing RNA silencing technologies.



Figure 1. Simulations of a bifacial Janus base binding to an RNA duplex containing the corresponding base-pairs illustrating the pre-organized right-handed structure of the gamma-PNA and the steric uniformity of the bifacial nucleotides.
 
While traditional ASOs can be long (i.e., 16-mers or longer), PATrOL™-enabled therapies can be as small as a 3-mer gamma-PNA due to the Janus bases, allowing them to better reach target tissue and disseminate evenly within cells. As a result of their capability to disperse through many body tissues, PATrOL™-enabled therapies have the potential to address whole-body symptoms of diseases that manifest in multiple organ systems.

Product Pipeline
 
Huntington’s Disease
 
HD is a devastating rare neurodegenerative disorder. After onset, symptoms such as uncontrolled movements, cognitive impairments and emotional disturbances worsen over time. HD is caused by toxic aggregation of mutant huntingtin protein, leading to progressive neuron loss in the striatum and cortex of the brain. The wildtype huntingtin gene (HTT) has a region in which a three-base DNA sequence, CAG, is repeated many times. When the DNA sequence CAG is repeated 26 or fewer times in this region, the resulting protein behaves normally. While the wildtype function of HTT is largely uncharacterized, the protein is known to be essential for normal brain development. When the DNA sequence CAG is repeated 40 times or more in this region, the resulting protein becomes toxic and causes HD. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of the HTT. Only one of the alleles (the “mutant” allele) needs to bear at least 40 CAG repeats for HD to occur. HD is one of many known repeat expansion disorders, which are a set of genetic disorders caused by a mutation that leads to a repeat of nucleotides exceeding the normal threshold. Current therapies for patients with HD can only manage individual symptoms. There is no approved therapy that has been shown to delay or halt disease progression. There are approximately 30,000 symptomatic patients in the U.S. and more than 200,000 at-risk of inheriting the disease.


NT0100 Program - PATrOL™ Enabled PNA for Huntington’s Disease 
 
The PATrOL™ platform has the potential to address many dominantly inherited genetic diseases. We will be initially focused on HD, a fatal rare genetic repeat expansion disorder with no viable treatment options.
 
One especially important advantage of the PATrOL™ platform that makes it promising for the treatment of repeat expansion disorders like HD is the ability of our small ASOs to potentially self-assemble within an RNA hairpin. As the number of repeats increases, the PATrOL™ oligonucleotides bind more tightly to each other and the mutant RNA. This allows our therapies to potentially inactivate mutant HTT mRNA before it can be translated into harmful protein via selective binding to the expanded CAG repeats while leaving the normal HTT mRNA largely unbound to drug and producing functional protein. Achieving mutant allele selectivity would be a key advantage for any RNA-based approach aiming to treat HD. The PATrOL™-enabled NT0100 program is currently in preclinical development for the treatment of HD.


NT0200 Program- PATrOL™ Enabled gamma-PNA for Myotonic Dystophy Type 1 


Our pipeline also contains a second near-term, potentially transformative medicine, which we believe has significant potential for a different severe and rare trinucleotide repeat disease, DM1. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder that primarily affects skeletal and smooth muscle. DM1 is caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the noncoding region of the DMPK gene, which captures and sequesters splice proteins. Sequestered splice proteins cannot then fulfill their normal functions. The diagnosis of DM1 is suspected in individuals with characteristic muscle weakness and is confirmed by molecular genetic testing of DMPK. CTG repeat length exceeding 34 repeats is abnormal. Molecular genetic testing detects pathogenic variants in nearly 100% of affected individuals. It is estimated that the global prevalence of DM1 is 1:20,000 individuals. The clinical candidates in development target the DM1 expanded allele with PATrOL™-enabled drug candidates to disrupt and/or open the mutant hairpin and allow release of sequestered splice proteins.
Additional Indications
 
In addition, we are in the process of building an early stage pipeline of other therapies that focus on the unique advantages of our technology across a variety of rare diseases.
Intellectual Property 
 
We have a strong intellectual property position behind our fundamental PATrOL™ technology that was developed at CMU. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates in the United States and other countries. We have exclusively licensed patent applications, pursuant to our license agreement with CMU (the “CMU License Agreement”), protecting our platform for development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics. We will focus our resources on obtaining patents and filing new patent applications that drive value.
 
We have an exclusive license to patent applications pursuant to the CMU License Agreement that may provide exclusivity for product candidates in our pipeline and may provide exclusivity for our core technology. Our core technology patent applications are directed to chemically-modified nucleosides and peptide nucleic acids to form compounds of biological and clinical interest. We have exclusively licensed patent applications pursuant to the CMU License Agreement to cover 16 Janus bases and treatment of repeat expansion disorders using this technology.

Peptide Nucleic Acids containing Modified Nucleobases
 
We have exclusively licensed patent applications pursuant to the CMU License Agreement covering peptide nucleic acid oligomers containing modified nucleobases, which can be used as a basis for therapeutics. Nucleosides and chemically modified nucleosides are the basic building blocks of our drug development platform. Therefore, claims that cover an oligonucleotide incorporating one of our proprietary modified nucleosides may apply to a wide array of mechanisms of action and therapeutic targets. Our modified nucleobases may comprise a divalent nucleobase in sequence with several other divalent nucleobases to create a PNA.


We have filed patent applications in this category in the United States and pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
 
Methods of Producing Peptide Nucleic Acids with Modified Nucleobases
 
We have exclusively licensed a patent (with an estimated expiration date of April 11, 2034) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement disclosing a method of manufacturing a peptide nucleic acid oligomer containing a modified nucleobase. We have exclusively licensed a provisional patent application (with an estimated expiration date of March 21, 2040) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement disclosing a method of synthesis of LH and RH gamma PNA monomers with on-resin sidechain functionalization.
Use of Peptide Nucleic Acids to Disrupt RNA Structure
 
We have exclusively licensed a provisional patent application (with an estimated expiration date of June 7, 2039) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement covering use of a peptide nucleic acid oligomer for disrupting a target RNA structure, to prevent translation of a target protein.
Use of Peptide Nucleic Acids to Treat Repeat Expansion Disorders
 
We have exclusively licensed patent applications (with an estimated expiration date of February 22, 2040) in the United States pursuant to the CMU License Agreement covering the use of a peptide nucleic acid oligomer for the treatment of repeat expansion disorders, including, for example, HD and DM1.
Patent Portfolio
 
As of January 7, 2020, we owned or in-licensed approximately 2 issued patents, which will expire in approximately 2034 without taking into account and possible patent term adjustments or extensions. As of January 7, 2020, we also owned or in-licensed approximately 13 patent applications, which if ultimately issued would expire as late as approximately 2040, based upon the potential expiration date of the last to expire of those patent applications without taking into account any possible patent term adjustments or extensions. As to the in-licensed patents and patent applications, they include 2 issued patents and 12 patent applications from CMU pursuant to the CMU License Agreement.
 
We plan to seek patent protection in significant markets and/or countries for each product to be developed. We also seek to maximize patent terms. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulatory review. The patent exclusivity period for a drug may deter generic drugs from entering the market. Patent exclusivity depends on a number of factors including initial patent term and available patent term extensions based upon delays caused by the regulatory approval process.
 
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our field.

While we have obtained patents and have patent applications pending, the extent of effective patent protection in the United States and other countries is highly uncertain. No consistent policy addresses the breadth of claims allowed in or the degree of protection afforded under patents of medical and pharmaceutical companies. Patents we currently own or may obtain might not be sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors with similar technology. Any of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented.
 
The holders of competing patents could determine to commence a lawsuit against us and may even prevail in any such lawsuit. Litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, which may harm our business. In addition, our efforts to protect or defend our proprietary rights may not be successful or, even if successful, may result in substantial cost to us.
 
License Agreement with Carnegie Mellon University
 
On December 17, 2018, we entered into the CMU License Agreement. Under the CMU License Agreement, CMU granted us an exclusive, worldwide right to the PATrOL™ technology, with 14 patents and patent applications describing composition of matter and uses of the platform. Our exclusive, worldwide right to the PATrOL™ technology is subject to CMU’s right (which is exercisable only upon our written consent) to grant a non-exclusive license to a third party as a means of resolving disputes or to settle claims arising out of allegations that the licensed technology under the CMU License Agreement infringes upon the intellectual property rights of such third party.
 
As partial consideration for the license right, we issued and delivered to CMU 835,625 shares of our common stock, which constituted 8.2% of the then fully diluted shares of our common stock. Further, as partial consideration for the license right, we issued a warrant to CMU, exercisable only upon the earlier of (i) the day that we received cumulative capital funding or revenues equal to $2 million or (ii) 30 days prior to any change of control event that provides for the issuance of shares, for a number of shares of our common stock sufficient such that when added to the 835,625 shares of our common stock, CMU’s holds in the aggregate an amount equal to 8.2% of the fully-diluted shares of our common stock; provided, however, that for purposes of calculating 8.2%, only the first $2 million of capital funding shall be considered in the determination of fully-diluted shares of our common stock. CMU exercised the warrant issued under the CMU License Agreement prior to the effective time of the Merger (as defined below) for an aggregate of 103,787 shares of our common stock. Under the CMU License Agreement, CMU has preemptive rights with respect to certain future sales of securities by us for capital-raising purposes, “piggyback” registration rights and co-sale rights with respect to certain resales of shares by our stockholders.


Pursuant to the CMU License Agreement, we paid CMU a one-time payment of approximately $54,000 for patenting and other intellectual property protection costs incurred by CMU prior to the effective date of the CMU License Agreement and relating to the licensed technology thereunder. Further, we must achieve certain milestones to demonstrate certain developments of the licensed product. We may obtain one 6-month extension to meet each milestone by making a nominal payment to CMU. Further, subject to certain conditions, we will pay to CMU royalties at a low single-digit percentage of aggregate annual net sales of licensed products and a percentage at the higher range of the bottom third of sublicensing fees.
 
The term of the CMU License Agreement concludes at the end of 20 years from its effective date or on the expiration date of the last-to-expire patent licensed, whichever comes later, unless otherwise terminated. The CMU License Agreement may be terminated (or the exclusivity of the license may be terminated) before the term due to customary payment default and fundamental change default provisions and failure of performance obligations. In addition, CMU may terminate the CMU License Agreement if we or our affiliates challenge the validity of the intellectual property licensed thereunder in a judicial or administrative proceeding. In the event we or our affiliates successfully challenge the validity of the intellectual property licensed thereunder, the royalties payable to CMU increase by a single digit percentage. We may terminate the CMU License Agreement upon payment of termination fees, the amounts of which depend on the date of such termination, but only if at the time of such termination, a licensed patent contains a valid claim. If not earlier terminated, at the expiration of the term, the rights and licenses granted to us by CMU survive in perpetuity, subject to our compliance with indemnification and dispute resolution obligations.

Manufacturing 
 
We currently manufacture our starting materials using third-party suppliers and our research-scale final products both in-house and externally. We intend to rely on third parties for larger scale manufacturing going forward. We do not have any current contractual arrangements for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our product candidates that we may develop. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.
Sales and Marketing 
 
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for any of our future product candidates. Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives when it approaches approval for the use of our product candidates for one or more indications.
Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is highly competitive and involves a high degree of risk. Potential competitors in the United States and worldwide are numerous and include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, educational institutions and research foundations. We compete with many of these companies who, either alone or with their strategic partners, have far greater experience, capital resources, research and technical resources, marketing experience, clinical trial experience, research and development staffs and facilities than we do. Some of our competitors may develop and commercialize products that compete directly with our product candidates, and they may introduce products to market earlier than our products or on a more cost-effective basis. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and also, in the future, to recruit clinical trial sites and subjects for our clinical trials.
 
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their competing products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for any of our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
There are currently no approved treatments available to slow the progression of HD. Based on publicly available information, Roche and Ionis have an investigational drug in Phase III clinical development, and several companies have ongoing clinical and preclinical programs targeting the underlying disease in HD, including Wave Life Sciences, LTD., Sangamo Biosciences, ProQR, Nuredis, uniQure, Spark Therapeutics (which was recently acquired by Roche) and Voyager Therapeutics. A number of other companies are developing drugs focused on treating the symptoms associated with HD, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Phase II), Vaccinex (Phase II), Prana Biotechnology (Phase II), Omeros Corporation (Phase II), Stealth BioTherapeutics (Phase II) and Azevan Pharmaceuticals (Phase II), among others.
 
There are no disease-modifying treatments available for DM1. Based on review of the clinictrials.gov and clinicialtrialsregister.eu websites, AMO Pharmaceuticals reported results of a 16-patient non-randomized, clinical trial in congenital DM1 with tidegluseb, a thiazoledione that inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, and is also currently initiating a 56 patient Phase II/III randomized, controlled study. Ionis conducted a Phase I/II trial of IONIS-DMPKRx in a randomized, controlled 48 patients with DM1 that did not demonstrate efficacy, and has since abandoned the indication. The Centre d’Etude des Cellules Souches (CECS), a non-commercial sponsor, is conducting a 40-patient clinical trial of metformin in DM1 in France. In addition to AMO Pharmaceuticals, Dyne, Vertex, Triplet Therapeutics, Expansion Therapeutics, and Nuredis are investigating agents to treat DM1.

Reverse Stock Split
 
On January 18, 2019, following a special meeting of our stockholders, our board of directors approved a one-for-twenty reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). On January 23, 2019, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split. Our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened on February 4, 2019. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the outstanding common stock decreased from 56,466,428 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to 2,829,248 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share.
 
Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information included in the financial statements and notes thereto, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split as if such Reverse Stock Split occurred on the first day of the first period presented. Certain amounts in the financial statements, the notes thereto, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, may be slightly different than previously reported due to rounding of fractional shares as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. 
 
Merger
 
On July 12, 2019, Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ohr”), completed a merger with NeuBase Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy NeuBase”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger Reorganization entered into on January 2, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) a subsidiary of Ohr merged with and into Legacy NeuBase, with Legacy NeuBase (renamed as “NeuBase Corporation”) continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ohr and the surviving corporation of the merger and (ii) Ohr was renamed as “NeuBase Therapeutics, Inc.” (the “Merger”). At the closing of the Merger, each outstanding share of Legacy NeuBase’s capital stock was converted into the right to receive 1.019055643 shares of the Company’s common stock. Shares of the Company’s common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “NBSE” as of market open on July 15, 2019. The Company’s previous ticker symbol was “OHRP”.
 
Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information included in the financial statements and notes thereto, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted for the Merger as if such Merger occurred on the first day of the first period presented. Certain amounts in the financial statements, the notes thereto, and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, may be slightly different than previously reported due to rounding of fractional shares as a result of the Merger.
 
Pre-Merger Financing
 
On July 11, 2019, prior to the completion of the Merger, Legacy NeuBase completed transactions contemplated by certain financing agreements (the “Pre-Merger Financing”) resulting in gross proceeds to Legacy NeuBase of approximately $9.0 million, consisting of (i) a private placement with certain accredited investors, whereby, among other things, Legacy NeuBase issued to such investors shares of Legacy NeuBase common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.40 million (the “Legacy NeuBase Equity Financing”) and (ii) the conversion of outstanding convertible notes of Legacy NeuBase with an aggregate principal amount of $600,000 (the “Legacy NeuBase Debt Financing”), which were automatically converted into Legacy NeuBase common stock immediately preceding the closing of the Legacy NeuBase Equity Financing at a conversion price equal to 90% of the purchase price per share of the Legacy NeuBase common stock issued in the Legacy NeuBase Equity Financing.
 
Post-Merger Financing
 
On July 12, 2019, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to sell to the investors an aggregate of 1,538,462 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $3.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 million (the “Post-Merger Financing”). On July 16, 2019, we completed the Post-Merger Financing and issued an aggregate of 1,538,462 shares of our common stock.
 
Legacy Pre-Merger Programs
 
As a result of the Merger, our going-forward operations will be primarily those of Legacy NeuBase. Pursuant to the Merger, we retained certain assets and technologies that were Ohr’s assets and technologies before the consummation of the Merger. Despite our expectation that our primary operations will be those of Legacy NeuBase on a going-forward basis, we may choose to monetize legacy Ohr assets in the future. Previously, Ohr acquired the SKS Ocular 1 LLC sustained release technology, which was designed to develop best in class drug formulations for ocular disease (the “SKS Assets”) and exclusive rights to an animal model for dry macular degeneration and rights to produce and use carboxyethylpyrrole (“CEP”) for research, clinical and commercial applications (the “CEP Assets”). In September 2019, we terminated the licenses for the SKS Assets and the CEP Assets, as the Board determined there would be substantial costs associated with continuing to maintain such assets and attempts to monetize such assets would be a distraction to our management and other employees and an inefficient use of their time. We continue to retain an equity interest in DepYmed, Inc. (“DepYmed”), a joint venture that Ohr entered into with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 2014. DepYmed is a preclinical stage company focused on Wilson’s disease, Rett syndrome, and oncology applications. We also retain intellectual property which has been licensed to DepYmed and have no other ongoing obligations (monetary or otherwise) to DepYmed.

Governmental Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Food and Drug Administration Regulation and Marketing Approval
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) of a clinical hold on clinical trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
 
These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
 
The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practice or other applicable regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which allows clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; 
· | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected, and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors and to assure clinical trial data integrity; 
· | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites; and 
· | FDA approval of an NDA, which must occur before a drug can be marketed or sold. 

 
15

 

IND and Clinical Trials
 
Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an IND, which contains the results of preclinical studies along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during drug development. Further, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the investigational plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
 
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
 

· | Phase I - The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients in order to determine metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase II - Clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. 
· | Phase III - When Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase III clinical trials, Phase III clinical trials in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical sites may be undertaken. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. 
· | Phase IV - The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These Phase IV clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. 

 
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
 
An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in the same dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with some of our product candidates, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial, is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

The NDA Approval Process
 
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA submission requires a substantial user fee payment (exceeding $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019) unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies, or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II clinical trials, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end-of-Phase II clinical trials meetings to discuss their Phase II clinical trials results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III registration trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for the NDA sponsor’s manufacturing the product in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
 
The results of drug development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and seeks to review standard NDAs within 12 months from submission of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or effectiveness to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
17

 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP regulations, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, Phase IV clinical trials, which are additional clinical trials performed after a product is approved. Phase IV clinical trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase IV clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA now has express statutory authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency.
 
The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”), which is the most restrictive REMS. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases if consensus is not obtained until after the “review date” set forth under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, as amended, the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the United States, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Our initial two programs are targeting orphan indications.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide a process for listing patents pertaining to approved products in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book) and for a competitor seeking approval of an application that references a product with listed patents to make certifications pertaining to such patents. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide for a statutory protection, known as non-patent exclusivity, against the FDA’s acceptance or approval of certain competitor applications.
Patent Term Restoration
 
Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during drug development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Orange Book Listing
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed by the NDA holder listed in the drug’s application or otherwise are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a Section VIII statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
An applicant submitting an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA (a “Section 505(b)(2) NDA”), which permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is required to certify to the FDA regarding any patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved product it references to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
19

 

Market Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Post-Marketing Requirements. 
 
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet, including social media. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval, or may include in a lengthy review process.
 
Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, as amended, a part of the FDCA.
 
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific, approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. NeuBase relies, and expects to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase IV testing, REMS to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly-discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products in development.

Reimbursement, Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The Medicare Modernization Act (“MMA”) established the Medicare Part D program (“Part D”) to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance), Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for product candidates for which NeuBase receives regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for our product candidates covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.
 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a clinical trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates, if approved. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis.

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be priced significantly lower than in the United States.
 
As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, or other good or service for which payment in whole or in part may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices or our future relationships with medical professionals might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize product candidates that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our product candidates, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a federal False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a federal False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
 
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.

The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
 
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (1) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (2) additions or modifications to product labeling; (3) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (4) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “PPACA”), was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

· | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the PPACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of the average manufacturer prices (“AMP”) and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The PPACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The CMS have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. In addition, the PPACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.

· | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly-eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
· | The PPACA imposes a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”). 

 
23

 


· | The PPACA imposes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to track this information and were required to make their first reports in March 2014. The information reported is publicly available on a searchable website. 
· | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the PPACA to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 
· | The PPACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. 
· | The PPACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 

 
Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and, at this time, the full effect of the PPACA on our business remains unclear. Further, there have been recent public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress, President Trump and his administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the PPACA. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which, among other things, eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage, effective January 1, 2019. We cannot predict the ultimate form or timing of any repeal or replacement of the PPACA or the effect such a repeal or replacement would have on our business.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the “BPCA”), certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a “Written Request”) relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would need to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with, and are responsive to, the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (the “PREA”), an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The PREA also authorizes the FDA to require holders of approved NDAs for marketed drugs to conduct pediatric studies under certain circumstances. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (the “FDASIA”), in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
