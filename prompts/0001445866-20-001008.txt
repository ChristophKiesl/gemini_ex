ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Events
 We are a mining company engaged in the business acquiring and developing metal and mineral properties that may contain recoverable gold and/or silver deposits. Although management is optimistic about its plans for developing certain such properties, to date, minimal mining activities have commenced and there can be no assurance that they will or that if they do commence, that the Company’s mining activities will be profitable. After the dismissal from bankruptcy in June 2016, we had no assets and approximately $20 million of indebtedness was reinstated.
 The properties we currently own were acquired subsequent to our dismissal from bankruptcy proceedings. We are in the process of raising capital that is required, in part, to begin development of our current mining properties and to help meet our working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the capital necessary to implement our business plan or if we are successful, that there may not be additional or superseding demands on our capital resources. Although the Company has been successful in meeting its capital requirements in the past, since emerging from Bankruptcy and management is optimistic about being able to secure needed funding, any failure to do so or any unforeseen expenses or other demands on the Company’s capital could result in the need to curtail or cease operation, resulting in losses to investors. 
 We are an exploration company that owns certain mining leases and other mineral rights. None of our properties contain any proven and probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7, and all of our activities on all of our properties are exploratory in nature.

Overview of Recent Developments
 Old New Mexico Properties Acquisitions
 In August 2017, the Company acquired the Malone Mine claims, Playa Hidalgo Placer claims. On October 23, 2017, the Pinos Altos claims were purchased for an aggregate of $500. These mining claims are located in Grant County and Hidalgo County, New Mexico.  
Alhambra Acquisition
 Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated August 2017, the Company acquired all the capital stock of Bullard’s Peak Corporation and the related patented unpatented claims in the Black Hawk district of New Mexico from Black Hawk Consolidated Mines Company for a purchase price of $3,115,365. The Company granted the seller a 2% net smelter return in perpetuity on all patented and unpatented claims.  The net smelter return is the greater of (i) all monies the Company receives for or from any and all ore removed from the property comprising the mining claims whether for exploration, mining operations or any other reason, and (ii) the fair market value of removed ore from the property comprising the mining claims.

Based upon the Company’s review of FASB’s Business Combinations (Topic 805) Update amendment and the acquisition and outside independent documentation for this acquisition, it does not meet the requirements of acquiring a business or a business combination. All assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset, Land. The Company relies on Sections 805-10-55-5, 805-10-55-5A and 805-10-55-5B that identify the acquisition is not considered a business or business combination.
 There were no mining operations being conducted on the property on the date of acquisition. Based on the Company’s analysis and understanding of documents obtained from outside sources and the sellers’ representations, no mining operations have been conducted on the property for the last five years. This is based on records from the New Mexico Department of Mines reflecting that they have no records of mining or exploration permits having ever been issued to any entity called Bullard’s Peak Corporation. A review of filed corporate tax returns also reflects no operational activities. To further assist the Company to determine if it acquired a business or a business combination, it looked to Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805).

 To date, there have been no mining or exploration activities at this mine site. With limited information, the Company has done an initial economic feasibility study and will need to complete future exploration activity on the property prior to developing a proper mining plan for the site. The Company currently considers the location as an exploration property with required geological work yet to be performed.
 British Columbia Properties
 On November 30, 2017, the Company entered into substantially identical agreements with Fortune Graphite, Inc. and Worldwide Graphite Producers, Ltd. to acquire a total of four placer claims for aggregate consideration of Can$400,000 and the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of Company common stock. Title to these claims remains in trust with the sellers until payment in full. To date, the Company has paid Can$260,000. The Company owes the sellers Can$140,000 and 10,000,000 shares of Company common stock. Based upon our subsequent scrutiny and analysis of the transaction, the Company in February 2019 initiated an arbitration proceeding against the seller to void and rescind the purchase of these British Columbia properties. In addition to voiding and rescinding the transaction, the Company is seeking additional remedies. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this arbitration, and there is no assurance that the Company will not lose its interest in these claims, or owe seller the remaining outstanding amounts. In connection with this arbitration, the Company’s legal position is to void the transaction and, due to the uncertainty of the outcome, has provided an impairment of the amount at June 30, 2019, in the amount of $210,116. 
Agreement for Two New Mexico Mining Properties
 The Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Minerals Acquisitions, LLC, that entered into an Agreement with a mining operator in January 2019 to purchase two properties in western New Mexico, known as the Billali Mine and the Jim Crow Imperial Mine (the “Billali Agreement” and the “Jim Crow Agreement.”) The purchase price for all rights and interests to be conveyed is $2,500,000 for the Billali Mine and $7,500,000 for the Jim Crow Imperial Mine, each documented as separate definitive agreements, with aggregate consideration for both definitive agreements payable as follows pursuant to the third amendment to the aforementioned agreements dated effective May 1, 2020: 
 *
$500,000 paid to date as of the filing date; 
 *
buyer to pay $50,000 monthly commencing July 1, 2020 and continuing for the next subsequent 19 months; 
 *
commencing 30 days after the last payment above, and continuing for the for an additional 48 subsequent payments, buyer to make each 30 days a payment in the amount of $175,000; 
 *
 after the final payment above and 30 days thereafter, the buyer will make the final payment of $100,000 completing the purchase. 
 *
each payment made hereunder will be allocated twenty-five per cent (25%) to the Billali and seventy-five percent (75%) to the Jim Crow, Imperial. 
 The Agreement has a 5% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on the nine patented Lode Claims up $650,000, and a 3% NSR royalty thereafter.
 Title and all rights and interest in the properties will be conveyed under the agreements upon completion of the payments of the purchase prices of the properties. The Company has the right to cancel the Agreement at any time.

Minerals Acquisitions, LLC was transferred the Jim Crow mine permit on August 20, 2019, from the selling party. The Company leases water rights for the mine site. The Company began initial site mining preparations at the Jim Crow mine during the last calendar quarter of 2019 and anticipates the first shipment of processed mineralized ore in the third calendar quarter of 2020 to our smelter. There can be no assurance of continued shipments of our processed mineralized ore until the Company enters into a long-term contract with the smelter, upon acceptance of our mineralized ore.
 Due to Covid-19 the smelter and all laboratories are on a very slow pace. We sent a sample to a laboratory, designated by our potential smelter, was taking four to six weeks to provide an analysis of the ore sample submitted. Upon receipt of successful laboratory results, the smelter will discuss an initial contract for our material.
 There were no mining operations being conducted on the property on the date of purchase. Based on the Company’s analysis and understanding of annual filed reports filed by the sellers, no mining operations have been conducted on the properties in the last four or five years. A review of the tax returns for the calendar years ended 2016-2018 support this position. The Company has inquired with the New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division to obtain the last few years of filings on Form 7, Annual Report Metal and Mill Concentrate Operations. The current reports obtained from the Division, reflect no mining operations have occurred in the years 2014 to 2018. Accordingly, (i) there were no revenue-producing activities and (ii) in connection with the acquisition, no employee base was associated with the acquisition, no market distribution system was associated with the acquisition, no sales force or customer base was associated with the acquisition, and no production techniques or actual production was associated with the acquisition of the properties. The Company believes that the physical facilities need various improvements prior to beginning mining operations.
 To further assist the Company to determine if it acquired a business or a business combination, it looked to Accounting Standards Update 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805). Based upon the Company’s review of the purchase agreement that provides for only the purchase of patented and unpatented mining claims as detailed in the agreement. Ownership transfers of these claims are not to transferred until the full amount specified in the agreement is paid in full. The Company has reviewed the tax returns of the sellers for their calendar tax years 2016-2018, which indicate no operations have occurred in those years. Based upon the Company’s review of FASB’s Business Combinations (Topic 805) Update amendment and the review of the acquisition documentation, this acquisition does not meet the requirements of acquiring a business. All assets to be acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, patented mining leases, as descripted in the Agreement. The Company relies on Sections 805-10-55-5, 805-10-55A and 805-10-55-5B that identify the acquisition is not considered a business or a business combination.
 The Company considers this property to be an exploration property. The Company will capitalize the payments under the Agreement as made to the sellers for the mineral interest. Initial activities on the sites will be to complete limited exploration activities and required mine development projects with the intent to start limited mining activities in the first half of calendar 2020. These activities may be delayed based on the current outbreak of Covid-19 situation and current unknown factors at this time.
 When the Company begins receiving revenue stream from these projects, the Company will amortize the capitalized payment balance each quarter thereafter. Companies that have reserves under Guide 7 typically capitalize these costs, and subsequently depreciate or amortize them on a units-of-production basis as reserves are mined. Unlike these other companies, on properties that have no reserves we will depreciate or amortize any capitalized costs based on the most appropriate amortization method, which includes straight-line or units-of-production method over the estimated life of the mine, as determined by our geologist. As we have no reliable information to compute a units of production methodology, we will amortize our capitalized costs on a straight-line basis. Because of these and other differences, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of mining companies that have established reserves on their properties.
 Competition 
 The mining industry is highly competitive. We will be competing with numerous companies, substantially all of which have far greater resources available to them that we are likely to when we commence operations. We therefore may be at a significant disadvantage in the course of obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment from time to time. Additionally, we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of mining exploration and development. 
Compliance with Government Regulations
 Overview
 Continuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the State of New Mexico will require the Company to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of New Mexico and the United States.
 The mining industry, (specifically the activities of exploration, drilling) operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. Thus, permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, 

8

also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues. 
 Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and to protect threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of our mining operations. These include “permitting” or “pre-operating approval” requirements that are designed: (i) to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, (ii) to ensure operating plans are designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, mining operations, and reclamation and (iii) that post-operation plans are designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once commercial mining operations have ceased.
 United States. Mining in the State of New Mexico is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of particular importance to the Company’s U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment.
 Land Ownership. On Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (General Mining Law) as amended, 30 U.S.C. §§ 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and Nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances. 
 Mining Operations
The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. The State of New Mexico likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. The State of New Mexico Mining and Minerals Division requires mine permits for each mining location. The permit has an Annual Permit Fee that is due by April 30 of each year. The Annual Permit Fee for minimal impact mines is currently $250. 
 Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project. Generally, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan to restore or replace the affected area. Often these requirements result in delays and/or costly studies or changes in the proposed activities; which may extend the time to completion. Although this may be necessary in order to mitigate the negative impact of certain aspects of an initial plan. All of these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate; and have a negative, and sometimes fatal, impact on the economic viability of the exploration or mining operation at issue. Finally, it is possible that future changes in laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, requiring the planned activities to be economically reevaluated at that time.
 Environmental Law
 Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies—in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act—have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
 The Clean Water Act.  The Federal Clean Water Act is the principal Federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 At the state level, water quality is regulated by the New Mexico Environment Department. If our exploration or any future development activities could affect a ground water aquifer, we are required to apply for a ground water discharge permit in compliance with the groundwater regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with surface water regulations is required.
 The Clean Air Act.  The Federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a Federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined 

9

in the Federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the Federal Clean Air Act to include various metals. The Federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
 National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.
 Endangered Species Act (“ESA”).  The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that “may affect” a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a “biological assessment” of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
 National Forest Management Act.  The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
 Wilderness Act.  The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of Federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA generally imposes joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, such persons may be subject to strict joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold the Company responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released.
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens’ suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
 National Historic Preservation Act.  The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
Effect of Existing or Potential Government Regulations 
  Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company at this time, although there can be no assurances that regulations may not arise in the future. To the extent that government regulations do arise in the future, they may have a negative effect on our operations, which may in turn, result in losses to investors. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
 Reclamation
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. As soon as we have a mining operation, we will be required to arrange and pledge certificates of deposits for reclamation with the state regulatory agencies. At this time no reclamation cost is calculated or carried forward. 

10

Employees
 We currently have two full time employees as of our current fiscal year end. In order to implement our business plan, we will be required to employ or retain qualified consultants with the technical expertise to evaluate and mine our mineral properties and for administrative duties as required.
 We initially planned to employ approximately ten to twelve miners upon commencing our initial mining operations in New Mexico in late 2019. Thereafter, we hired approximately thirteen and as of the most recent date hereof, we have eight employees working on our mining operations in New Mexico in June 2020. The reduction in employees is due to the continuing effects of Covid-19.
Insurance
 We currently maintain liability and workmen’s compensation insurance coverage to cover losses or risks incurred in the ordinary course of business. 
 Exploration
 The Company has spent only nominal amounts during each of the last three fiscal years on exploration and mine development. 
 Seasonality 
 We have no properties at this time that are subject to material restrictions on our operations due to seasonality. 
 Office Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 3544 Rio Grande Blvd. NW, Albuquerque, NM 87107. Our telephone number is (505) 255-4852. 
 Dismissal of Bankruptcy Proceeding and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization
 In August 2015, the Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware in order to secure the existing assets from creditor actions, Case No. 15-11761 (MFW). Jakes Jordaan, our former chief executive officer, filed an affidavit in support of the first day motion that we had only one remaining option (plan) to have an orderly sale of all assets to satisfying qualified debt without any plan thereafter and he began working with an investment banker to assist with these efforts. The “asset sale” took place in February 2016 and left Santa Fe and its subsidiaries without any assets but with the remaining debt.
 After the dismissal of the bankruptcy case, the Company had limited assets, but remained liable for all commitments and debts that then were outstanding. Santa Fe Gold Barbados, The Lordsburg Mining Company and AZCO are subsidiaries of the Company with nominal assets and all of their commitments and debts remain. The bankruptcy court set up a trust fund funded by the activities of the Summit mine (main asset sold in bankruptcy proceedings) for five years from the inception of mine production at the Summit mine, with the funds held in trust distributed by an independent trustee to certain unsecured creditors. 
 Santa Fe failed to provide a plan of reorganization in connection with its petition under Chapter 11of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The significant transactions that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy were as follows:
 ·

The approximately $20 million of indebtedness outstanding on account of the Company’s senior notes and unsecured claims were reinstated; and 
 ·

The courts established a trust in April 2016 for the benefit of certain creditors. A profit interest was attached to the Summit mine for the benefit of certain creditors holding unsecured claims filed by each creditor. 
 The Company received Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the dismissal in June 2016, and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy. The only funds available for the future administrative costs were prepaid insurance funds of approximately $49,000. The Company subsequently began selling on a best-efforts basis equity for the cash needed for working capital purposes. Currently we have no continuing commitment from any party to provide working capital, and there is no certainty that the Company will be able to continue its current business plan. 
 At the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company wrote off debt and related, accrued interest in the aggregate amount of $12,506,540. The write off of debt was related to two finance facilities that were outside of the British Columbia statutes of limitations. The Company retained legal services in British Columbia to research the British Columbia statutes of limitations on the collectability of the finance facilities. Legal counsel reviewed all related documents, records of proceedings and all records and 

11

documents deemed relevant to the two finance facilities. It was determined that the finance facilities were subject to the laws of the Providence of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada. The Company received a written legal opinion from legal counsel, with respect to the two finance facilities and any sums due there under. Our counsel determined, after researching the Limitations Act (British Columbia) and relevant case law in the Provence of British Columbia, that the sums the Company had been carrying on its books and records related to those two finance facilities were time barred from any collection efforts because they are outside of statute of limitations period allowed under British Columbia law. Stated differently, the statutes of limitations has run for the two finance facility liabilities pursuant to the Limitations Act (British Columbia) and no future claims can be commenced in the Providence of British Columbia for collection thereunder. Therefore, the Company has no outstanding legal obligation on the two finance facilities.
