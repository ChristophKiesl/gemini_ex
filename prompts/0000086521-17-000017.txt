GOVERNMENT REGULATION
California State Utility Regulation
The California Utilities are principally regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
The CPUC: 

▪ | consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms.


▪ | regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in “United States Utility Regulation.”


▪ | has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California.


▪ | conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines, and conducts investigations into various matters, such as safety, deregulation, competition and the environment, to determine its future policies.


▪ | regulates the interactions and transactions of the California Utilities with Sempra Energy and its other affiliates.

The CPUC also oversees and regulates new products and services, including solar and wind energy, bioenergy, alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC’s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety violations.
We provide further discussion in Notes 13, 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
The CEC publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories. Based on these forecasts, the CEC:

▪ | determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;


▪ | sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;


▪ | promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand within the state of California for electricity and natural gas;


▪ | maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and


▪ | certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.

The CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and costs of transportation and distribution. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the California Utilities’ long-term investment decisions.
The state of California requires certain California electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver a percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by both the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) Program. We discuss this requirement as it applies to SDG&E in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” in the Annual Report.
Certification of a generation project by the CEC as an Eligible Renewable Energy Resource (ERR) allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the RPS Program requirements, if such purchase meets the provisions of California Senate Bill X1-2. This may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by Sempra Renewables and Sempra Mexico, particularly from California utilities. We have obtained or plan to obtain ERR certification for all of our renewable facilities operating in and/or providing power to California as they become operational.
California Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The bill requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emission reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor’s Office in the Executive Branch of California State Government. Sempra LNG & Midstream and Sempra Mexico are also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB. We provide further discussion of GHG emissions in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
The operation and maintenance of SoCalGas’ natural gas storage facilities are regulated by the California Department of Conservation’s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR), in accordance with various other state and local agencies described below in “Other State and Local Regulation Within the U.S.”
United States Utility Regulation
The California Utilities are also regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).
In the case of SDG&E, the FERC regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return on transmission investment, the uniform systems of accounts, rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale. The National Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for transmission service. The FERC approved the California investor-owned utilities’ (IOUs) transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the Independent System Operator (ISO) in 1998.
In the case of SoCalGas, the FERC regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts.
The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the United States, including the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS), in which SDG&E owns a 20-percent interest. NRC and various state regulations require extensive review of the safety, radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities. The majority owner of SONGS, Southern California Edison Company (Edison), made a decision to permanently retire the facility in June 2013. We provide further discussion of current SONGS matters involving the NRC and the closure of the facility in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
The DOT, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable to the California Utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California. The PHMSA also is in the process of promulgating regulations applicable to the California Utilities’ natural gas storage facilities. See “Other U.S. Regulation” below.
Other State and Local Regulation Within the U.S.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin in Southern California. The district’s territory covers all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
SoCalGas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and the 223 cities in its service territory. These franchises allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration date. Some franchises have fixed expiration dates, ranging from 2017 to 2062. SoCalGas seeks to renew or extend these agreements prior to their expiration. Major franchise agreements include those for Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County franchise agreement was entered into in 1955, with the current extension expiring in December 2017. The City of Los Angeles franchise was entered into in 1992, with the current extension expiring in June 2017.
SDG&E has

▪ | electric franchises with the two counties served and the 27 cities in or adjoining its electric service territory; and


▪ | natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory.

These franchises allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates. Some natural gas and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range from 2021 to 2035.
Sempra Renewables has operations, investments or development projects in various U.S. markets. Sempra LNG & Midstream develops and invests in liquefied natural gas (LNG)-related infrastructure in North America, develops and operates natural gas storage facilities in Alabama and Mississippi and owns a 50.2-percent interest in a liquefaction project in Louisiana. It is also seeking authorization to develop an LNG natural gas liquefaction and export terminal in Port Arthur, Texas.
Other U.S. Regulation
The FERC regulates certain Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream assets pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and Natural Gas Act, which provide for FERC jurisdiction over, among other things, sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce, transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting of LNG terminals. In addition, certain Sempra Renewables power generation assets are required under the FPA to comply with reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Bay Gas Storage Company, Ltd.’s (Bay Gas) natural gas storage operations are also regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Sempra LNG & Midstream also has an investment in Cameron LNG Holdings, LLC (Cameron LNG JV), located in Louisiana, that is subject to regulations of the DOE regarding the export of LNG. We discuss Sempra LNG & Midstream’s investments further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 
The FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. FERC-regulated rates at the following businesses are

▪ | Sempra Renewables and Sempra LNG & Midstream: market-based for wholesale electricity sales


▪ | Sempra LNG & Midstream: cost-based for the transportation of natural gas


▪ | Sempra LNG & Midstream: market-based for the storage of natural gas, as well as the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas

The California Utilities, Sempra LNG & Midstream and businesses that Sempra LNG & Midstream invests in are subject to DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. PHMSA, acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety, is responsible for administering the DOT’s national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipeline, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities. The California Utilities, Sempra LNG & Midstream, Sempra Renewables and Sempra Mexico are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

(1) | A QF is a generating facility which meets the requirements for QF status under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.

It includes cogeneration facilities, which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) 
used for industrial, commercial, residential or institutional purposes.

(2) | Tolling contracts are purchased-power agreements under which SDG&E provides natural gas for generation to the energy supplier.


(3) | Agreements to purchase firm energy during specific periods at fixed prices.

Charges under most of the contracts with QFs are based on what it would incrementally cost SDG&E to produce the power or procure it from other sources. Charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and as-generated energy, and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. The prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated.
Natural Gas Supply
SDG&E buys natural gas under short-term contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchased-power arrangements. Purchases are from various southwestern U.S. suppliers and are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices. 
Power Pool
SDG&E is a participant in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities, power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers located throughout the United States and Canada. Participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC. Participation in the Western Systems Power Pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk.
Electric Transmission System
Service to SDG&E’s customers is supported by the electric transmission system. SDG&E’s 500-kilovolt (kV) Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E’s share of the line is 1,162 megawatts (MW), although it can be less under certain system conditions. SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line constructed and operated by SDG&E with import capability of 1,000 MW of power. 
Mexico’s Baja California system is connected to SDG&E’s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity up to 408 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction, although it can be less under certain system conditions.
Edison’s transmission is connected to SDG&E’s system at SONGS via five 230-kV transmission lines.
Chilquinta Energía
Customers
Chilquinta Energía has approximately 688,000 customer meters in the region of Valparaíso in central Chile, with a service area covering 4,400 square miles. At December 31, 2016, its customer meters consisted of approximately:

• | 634,700 residential


• | 38,700 commercial


• | 1,400 industrial


• | 7,700 street and highway lighting


• | 5,300 agricultural

In Chile, customers are classified as regulated and non-regulated customers based on installed capacity. Regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is less than 500 kilowatts (kW). Non-regulated customers are those whose installed capacity is greater than 2,000 kW. Customers with installed capacity between 500 kW and 2,000 kW may choose to be classified as regulated or non-regulated. Non-regulated customers can buy power from other sources, such as directly from the generator.
In 2016, Chilquinta Energía added approximately 16,000 new customer meters at a growth rate of 2.3 percent. Chilquinta Energía’s electric energy sales increased by approximately 13,000 megawatt hours (MWh) and decreased by approximately 57,000 MWh in 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an annual growth rate of 0.4 percent in 2016 and a decline of 1.9 percent in 2015. The decrease in electric energy sales in 2015 was primarily due to the transfer of certain non-regulated customers from Chilquinta Energía to the energy-services company, Tecnored S.A., a subsidiary of Sempra South American Utilities in Chile.
Electric Resources
The supply of electric power available to Chilquinta Energía comes from purchased-power contracts currently in place with its various suppliers and its suppliers’ generating facilities. This supply as of December 31, 2016 was as follows:

CHILQUINTA ENERGÍA ELECTRIC RESOURCES
Resource | Number of contracts | | Expiration date | | Megawatts
Purchased-power contracts(1)(2): | | | 
 | Thermal/Hydro/Wind/Solar/Biomass | 29 | | 2020 to 2026 | | 447
Small generation plants: | | | | | | 
 | Thermal | | | | | 8 
Total | | | | | 455 | 


(1) | Contracts with fuel sources that include natural gas, coal or diesel are collectively referred to as thermal.


(2) | In 2016, energy contracts in the Central Interconnected System, where Chilquinta Energía operates, were supplied 53

percent from thermal, 37 percent from hydro, 4 percent from wind, 3 percent from solar and 3 percent from biomass sources.
Power Generation System
Centers for Economic Load Dispatch (Centros de Despacho Económico de Carga, or CDEC), private organizations, were in charge of coordinating the operation of the electricity system until December 31, 2016. Each interconnected system was subject to its own CDEC. Chilquinta Energía operates within CDEC-SIC (Sistema Interconectado Central, or Central Interconnected System).
Effective January 1, 2017, the National Electric System is operated and coordinated by the National Electric Coordinator (Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional), a new independent entity. This institution is managed by a Directive Council (Consejo Directivo) formed by five members designated through a public tender. This new entity functions as a continuation of the CDEC for the central and northern interconnected system.
Transmission System and Access
Transmission lines in Chile are either part of its main transmission system (sistema de transmisión troncal) or its sub-transmission system (sistema de subtransmisión). Sub-transmission systems, including those owned by Chilquinta Energía, are comprised of infrastructure that is interconnected to the electricity system to supply non-regulated and regulated end-users located in the distribution service area.
We discuss transmission line projects that have been completed or are ongoing at Chilquinta Energía’s joint ventures in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business” in the Annual Report.
Luz del Sur 
Customers
Luz del Sur has approximately 1,078,000 customer meters in the southern zone of metropolitan Lima, Peru, with a service area covering approximately 1,394 square miles. At December 31, 2016, its customer meters consisted of approximately:

• | 1,011,500 residential


• | 56,600 commercial


• | 4,100 industrial


• | 5,100 street and highway lighting


• | 500 agricultural

In Peru, customers are classified as regulated and non-regulated customers based on capacity demand. Regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is less than 200 kW and their energy supply is considered public service. Non-regulated customers are those whose capacity demand is greater than 2,500 kW. Customers with capacity demand between 200 kW and 2,500 kW may choose to be classified as regulated or non-regulated.
In 2016, Luz del Sur added approximately 25,000 new customer meters at a growth rate of 2.4 percent. However, Luz del Sur’s electric energy sales decreased by approximately 162,000 MWh in 2016, compared to an increase of approximately 262,000 MWh in 2015, representing a decrease in annual growth rate of 2.1 percent in 2016 and an increase of 3.6 percent in 2015. The decrease in electric energy sales in 2016 is primarily due to the migration of regulated and non-regulated customers to tolling customers, who only pay a tolling fee and do not contribute to customer load.
Electric Resources
The supply of electric power available to Luz del Sur comes from purchased-power contracts currently in place with various suppliers, as well as purchases made on an as-needed basis. Luz del Sur also uses the supply of power generated by Santa Teresa, its wholly owned 100-MW hydroelectric power plant in Peru’s Cusco region.
Luz del Sur’s electric power supply as of December 31, 2016 was as follows:

LUZ DEL SUR ELECTRIC RESOURCES 
Resource | Number of contracts | | Expiration date | | Megawatts
Purchased-power contracts(1): | | | 
Bilateral contract: | | | | |

 | Thermal | 21 | | 2021 to 2025 | | 687 
 | Hydro/Thermal | 26 | | 2021 to 2025 | | 537 
 | Total contracted | | | | | 1,482
Owned generation, Hydro: | | | | | 
 | Santa Teresa(2) | | | | | 61 
Total contracted and owned generation | | | | | 1,543 | 


(1) | Contracts with fuel sources that include natural gas, coal or diesel are collectively referred to as thermal.


(2) | Firm capacity is estimated at 61 MW based on guidelines established by the system operator in Peru and historical water

flows. Available excess capacity is sold on the spot market.
Power Generation System
The Sistema Eléctrico Interconectado Nacional (SEIN) is the Peruvian national interconnected system. The OSINERGMIN, in addition to setting tariffs as discussed above, supervises the bidding processes for energy purchases between distribution companies and generators.
The Committee of Economic Operation of the National Interconnected System (Comité de Operación Económica del Sistema Interconectado Nacional) coordinates the operation and dispatch of electricity of the SEIN.
Transmission System and Access
Transmission lines in Peru are divided into principal and secondary systems. The principal system lines are accessible by all generators and allow the flow of energy through the national grid. The secondary system lines connect principal transmission with the network of distribution companies or connect directly to certain final customers. The transmission company receives tariff revenues and collects tolls based on a charge per unit of electricity.
We discuss ongoing transmission line and substation projects at Luz del Sur in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business” in the Annual Report.
CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS
SoCalGas and SDG&E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers and SDG&E’s core customers on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others. We discuss the California Utilities’ resource planning, natural gas procurement, contractual commitments, and related regulatory matters below. We also provide further discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

At December 31, 2016, SoCalGas had approximately 5.9 million customer meters consisting of approximately:

▪ | 5,656,500 residential


▪ | 247,300 commercial


▪ | 26,000 industrial


▪ | 50 electric generation and wholesale

At December 31, 2016, SDG&E had approximately 878,000 natural gas customer meters consisting of approximately:

▪ | 845,600 residential


▪ | 28,600 commercial


▪ | 3,900 electric generation and transportation

For regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Noncore customers at SoCalGas consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, large commercial and industrial, and enhanced oil recovery customers. SoCalGas’ wholesale customers are primarily other IOUs, including SDG&E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers.
Most core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers, marketers or brokers, the California Utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers. Noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements. 
Natural Gas Procurement and Transportation
SoCalGas purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts for the California Utilities’ residential and smaller business customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from various sources, including from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern regions of the U.S. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices.
To help ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs of customers, SoCalGas has firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights. Pipeline companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas’ intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas or its transportation customers from outside of California. 
Natural Gas Storage
SoCalGas owns four natural gas storage facilities. The facilities have a combined working gas capacity of 137 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and have over 200 injection, withdrawal and observation wells. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for ensuring service reliability during peak demand periods, including heating needs in the winter, as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility represents 63 percent of SoCalGas’ natural gas storage capacity. SoCalGas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the Aliso Canyon facility in October 2015, and permanently sealed the well in February 2016. SoCalGas has not injected natural gas into Aliso Canyon since October 25, 2015, pursuant to orders from DOGGR and the Governor, and Senate Bill (SB) 380, all discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. Limited withdrawals of natural gas from Aliso Canyon have been made in 2017 to augment natural gas supplies during critical demand periods. SoCalGas completed its measurement of the natural gas lost from the leak and calculated that approximately 4.62 Bcf of natural gas was released from the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility as a result of the leak. In November 2016, SoCalGas submitted a request to DOGGR seeking authorization to resume injection operations at the Aliso Canyon storage facility. In accordance with SB 380, DOGGR held public meetings on February 1 and 2, 2017 to receive public comment on DOGGR’s findings from its gas storage and well safety review and proposed pressure limits for the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility. The public comment period has expired. It remains for DOGGR to issue its safety determination, after which the CPUC must concur with DOGGR’s determination, before injections at the facility can resume. We discuss the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility gas leak in “Risk Factors” below and in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 
SoCalGas also provides natural gas storage services directly to its customers. It uses the majority of its natural gas storage capacity to provide service to its residential and smaller business customers and offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others. 
Demand for Natural Gas
Demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, California’s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Other external factors such as weather, the price of electricity, the use of hydroelectric power, development of renewable energy resources, development of new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas outside the state of California, and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in market price, which may in turn impact demand.
One of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation. Natural gas-fired electric generation within Southern California (and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants) competes with electric power generated throughout the western United States. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity, growth in renewable generation (including rooftop solar), the addition of more efficient gas technologies, new energy efficiency initiatives, and the extent that regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the California Utilities’ respective service areas. The demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to climate change, weather conditions and other impacts, and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources. We provide additional information regarding the electric industry and related infrastructure projects and regulatory impacts at the California Utilities in “Our Business” and “Factors Influencing Future Performance” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
The natural gas distribution business is seasonal, and cash provided from operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months. As is prevalent in the industry, but subject to current regulatory limitations, SoCalGas usually injects natural gas into storage during the summer months (April through October), which reduces cash provided from operating activities during this period, for withdrawal from storage usually during the winter months (November through March), which increases cash provided from operating activities, when customer demand is higher. 
RATES AND REGULATION
We provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to our utilities in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Notes 1, 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE
We provide descriptions of Sempra Infrastructure’s segments and information concerning their operations in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Notes 1, 3, 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
Competition
Sempra Energy’s non-utility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar services. They are engaged in competitive activities that require significant capital investments and skilled and experienced personnel. Among these competitors there may be significant variation in financial, personnel and other resources compared to Sempra Infrastructure.
Generation – Renewables
Sempra Renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity through its development of and investments in wind and solar power generation facilities. Sempra Renewables also competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, and other energy service companies for sales of non-contracted renewable energy. The number and type of competitors may vary based on location, generation type and project size. Also, regulatory initiatives designed to enhance energy consumption from renewable resources for regulated utility companies may increase competition from these types of institutions. These utilities may have a cost of capital that differs from most independent renewable power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms. This allows them to build, buy and upgrade renewable generation projects without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments. Additionally, generation from Sempra Renewables’ renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight.
Our renewable energy competitors include, among others:

§ | Avangrid | § | MidAmerican Energy 
§ | First Solar | § | NextEra Energy Resources
§ | Invenergy | § | NRG Energy 

Because Sempra Mexico sells the power that it generates at its Energía Sierra Juárez wind power generation facility into California, it is also impacted by these competitive factors.
LNG
Technological advances associated with shale gas and tight oil production have significantly reduced the need for North American LNG import facilities and increased interest in liquefaction and export opportunities.
At current forward gas prices, U.S. Gulf Coast liquefaction is among the most price competitive potential LNG supply in the world. Brownfield liquefaction is particularly price competitive, resulting from many factors, including:

▪ | high levels of developed and undeveloped North American unconventional natural gas and tight oil resources relative to domestic consumption levels;


▪ | increasing gas and oil drilling productivity and decreasing unit costs of gas production;


▪ | low breakeven prices of marginal North American unconventional gas production;


▪ | proximity to ample existing gas transmission pipeline and underground gas storage capacity; and


▪ | existing LNG tankage and berths.

Global LNG competition may limit U.S. LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match U.S. Gulf Coast LNG production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility. Host governments for international liquefaction projects are altering fiscal and tax regimes in an effort to make projects in their jurisdictions competitive relative to U.S. projects; however, sustained low oil prices may cause some of the international projects to become unfeasible due to their LNG price formulas’ link to oil prices. It is expected that U.S. LNG exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand, and thereby facilitate development of a global commodity market for natural gas and LNG.
Sempra LNG & Midstream has a 50.2-percent equity interest in Cameron LNG JV, which owns a regasification facility in Hackberry, Louisiana. The joint venture began construction in the second half of 2014 on a natural gas liquefaction export facility using some of the existing regasification infrastructure. The joint venture has authorization to export LNG to both Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries and to countries that do not have an FTA with the United States.
Cameron LNG JV has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with ENGIE S.A. and affiliates of Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., which subscribe the full nameplate capacity of three trains at the facility. In addition, Cameron LNG JV is working on the development of up to two additional trains. We discuss Cameron LNG JV in Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the construction of the first three trains in “Our Business” and “Factors Influencing Future Performance” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report. Our joint venture partners, affiliates of ENGIE S.A., Mitsubishi Corporation (through a related company jointly established with Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha), and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., compete globally to market and sell LNG to end users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG importing countries around the world. By providing liquefaction services, Cameron LNG JV will compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe.
Sempra Energy is also taking steps to explore the development of additional LNG export facilities at Sempra LNG & Midstream’s Port Arthur, Texas property and Sempra Mexico’s Energía Costa Azul regasification facility.
Our LNG liquefaction business’ major domestic and international competitors will include, among others, the following companies and their related LNG affiliates:

§ | BP | § | Petronas 
§ | Cheniere Energy | § | Qatar Petroleum 
§ | Chevron | § | Royal Dutch Shell
§ | ConocoPhillips | § | Total 
§ | ExxonMobil | § | Woodside 
§ | Kinder Morgan | | 

Natural Gas Pipelines and Storage Facilities
Within their respective market areas, Sempra LNG & Midstream’s and Sempra Mexico’s pipeline businesses and Sempra LNG & Midstream’s storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets.
Sempra LNG & Midstream’s competitors include, among others:

§ | Boardwalk Pipeline Partners | § | Kinder Morgan 
§ | Cardinal Gas Storage Partners | § | Macquarie Infrastructure Partners
§ | Columbia Energy | § | Plains All American Pipeline 
§ | Enbridge | § | Southern Company Gas 
§ | Energy Transfer Partners | § | TransCanada 
§ | Enterprise Products Partners | § | The Williams Companies 

Sempra Mexico’s competitors include, among others:

§ | Carso Energy | § | Fermaca 
§ | Enagas | § | Kinder Morgan
§ | ENGIE S.A. | § | TransCanada 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.
Hazardous Substances
The CPUC’s Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism allows California’s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. This mechanism permits the California Utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70 percent of the related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, the California Utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.
We record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.
Air and Water Quality
The electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent air-quality and greenhouse gas standards, such as those established by the EPA, the CARB and SCAQMD. The California Utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards. We discuss greenhouse gas standards and credits further in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
We discuss environmental matters concerning SoCalGas’ Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in “Risk Factors” below, and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Influencing Future Performance” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
