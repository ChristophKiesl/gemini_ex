Life Sciences Market
Our life sciences businesses serve a broad range of end markets within the life sciences industry to address a confluence of life sciences trends, such as technology, information management and new sophisticated tools and applications. With the advent of biologics and personalized medicine, biological samples have become critical assets to the success of drug and therapy pipelines, and the proper management and protection of these samples has gained increased importance to our customers. We believe this trend has created a sizable market opportunity for Brooks to provide comprehensive sample management and genomic solutions.
Since the successful mapping of the full human genome at the turn of this century, the market for genomic services has grown in support of research in biologic drug development, personalized medicine and cell/gene therapy. Top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can use their in-house laboratory resources to sequence the millions of genes needed as part of their research workflow. Still, many companies look to outsource their gene sequencing to independent laboratories that provide expedited results and expert consultative services. Other companies and institutions have fewer or no in-house options and make use of outsourced capabilities as their primary solution. We participate in this market as a value-added laboratory services provider, offering high quality genetic testing services with fast turnaround time. 
We have more than 8,700 customers globally and we address only a fraction of the industry. We serve top customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, the most advanced research hospitals performing clinical research and therapy development, as well as some of the newest and leading-edge start-ups in the biotech space. We also serve academic and government institutions. We believe that the sample-based services and products business will continue to demonstrate a growth trajectory and we do not observe cyclical characteristics in demand for these offerings. `
