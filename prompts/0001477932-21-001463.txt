Our objective is to provide our shareholders with solid returns through strategic investments across multiple consumer product and food ingredient platforms. The platforms we are focusing on include:

Once we secure sufficient capital to enable us to fully implement our business plan, we expect revenues and associated margins to increase as we continue to commercialize segments and products within our portfolio.

· | Consumer goods with focus on supplements, functional foods & beverages; 
· | Life science technology that has applications in consumer products with a focus on nutritional, brain and heart health products; and
· | Intellectual property and/or licenses in recognized brand platforms. 

 
In addition to investments in brands and technology, we will seek to acquire positions in businesses to support our strategy through the use of common and/or preferred equity, senior secured, unsecured, and convertible debt in organizations who meet our investment goals. Through our management and directors vast expertise in both the consumer branded segment and strategic investment experience, we seek to provide our shareholders a sound return on their investment. 
 
The Company’s strategic objective is to:

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
