Restaurant Brands
 
Better Burgers Fast Casual
 
We operate and franchise a system-wide total of 39 fast casual restaurants specializing the “Better Burger” category of which 27 are company-owned and 12 are owned and operated by franchisees under franchise agreements.
 
American Burger Company (“ABC”) is a fast-casual dining chain consisting of 9 locations in North Carolina, South Carolina and New York, known for its diverse menu featuring fresh salads, customized burgers, milk shakes, sandwiches, and beer and wine.

BGR: The Burger Joint (“BGR”) was acquired in March 2015 and consists of 10 company-owned locations in the United States and 12 franchisee-operated locations in the United States and the Middle East.
 
Little Big Burger (“LBB”) was acquired in September 2015 and consists of 8 company-owned locations in the Portland, Oregon area.
 
We plan to accelerate expansion of our better burger business through a combination of company-owned stores, franchising and partnerships primarily in the United States. Within the Burger group, we plan to focus the majority of our resources on growing Little Big Burger, where we are realizing industry-leading margins and returns on capital from our current store locations. We are also considering opportunities to expand the better burger business internationally, primarily focusing on those regions where we operate Hooters restaurants to leverage our local infrastructure and management teams across multiple brands. For our BGR and American Burger Company brands, we intend to open new stores in 2017, albeit at a slower pace than for our Little Big Burger Brand.
 
Just Fresh Fast Casual
 
We operate Just Fresh, our healthier eating fast casual concept with 7 company owned locations in Charlotte, North Carolina. Just Fresh offers fresh-squeezed juices, gourmet coffee, fresh-baked goods and premium-quality, made-to-order sandwiches, salads and soups. We currently hold a 56% controlling interest in Just Fresh.
 
Our plans for Just Fresh include maximizing cash flow from our current locations while we evaluate the optimal growth strategy for the brand. As we have allocated the majority of our current internal and financial resources on growing Little Big Burger, we do not anticipate opening new Just Fresh locations in the near term. However, we believe the Just Fresh tradename and operating model provides significant untapped potential for future growth as a company or franchise model and intend to formalize the longer-term growth strategy for this brand over the coming year.
 
Hooters Full Service
 
Hooters restaurants are casual beach-themed establishments featuring music, sports on large flat screens, and a menu that includes seafood, sandwiches, burgers, salads, and of course, Hooters original chicken wings and the “nearly world famous” Hooters Girls.
 
We own and operate 9 Hooters full service restaurants in the United States, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Chanticleer started initially as an investor in Hooters of America and, subsequently evolved into a franchisee operator. We continue to hold a minority investment stake in Hooters of America and operate Hooters restaurants in our regions. However, we do not currently intend to invest in growing the Hooters segment and instead plan to utilize the cash flows from this segment to support growth in our other fast casual brands.
 
Restaurant Geographic Locations
 
United States
 
We currently operate ABC, BGR and LBB restaurants in the United States as our Better Burger Group. ABC is located in North Carolina, South Carolina and New York. BGR operates company restaurants in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as franchise locations in the US and internationally. LBB operates in the Portland and Eugene, Oregon areas.
 
We operate Just Fresh restaurants in the Charlotte, North Carolina area.
 
We operate Hooters restaurants in Tacoma, Washington and Portland, Oregon (“Hooters Pacific NW”). We also operate gaming machines in Portland, Oregon under license from the Oregon Lottery Commission.

We currently own and operate 6 Hooters locations in South Africa: Durban, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg (3 locations).
 
Europe
 
We currently own 100% of West End Wings, Ltd, the entity that holds the franchise rights and operates the Hooters restaurant in Nottingham, England (“Hooters Nottingham”).
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is extremely competitive. We compete with other restaurants on the taste, quality and price of our food offerings. Additionally, we compete with other restaurants on service, ambience, location and overall customer experience. We believe that we compete primarily with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining and quick casual establishments, and to a lesser extent with quick service restaurants in general. Many of our competitors are well-established national, regional or local chains and many have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees.
Proprietary Rights
 
We have trademarks and trade names associated with Just Fresh, American Burger, BGR and Little Big Burger. We believe that the trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights that we use in our restaurants have significant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts. Although we believe that we have sufficient rights to all of our trademarks and service marks, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to market our restaurants and promote our brand. Any such litigation may be costly and divert resources from our business. Moreover, if we are unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may be prevented from using our trademarks or service marks in the future and may be liable for damages.
 
We also use the “Hooters” mark and certain other service marks and trademarks used in our Hooters restaurants pursuant to our franchise agreements with Hooters of America.
 
Government Regulation
 
Environmental regulation.
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 
Local regulation.
 
Our locations are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, which may include health, sanitation, safety, fire, building and other agencies in the countries, states or municipalities in which the restaurants are located. Opening sites in new areas could be delayed by license and approval processes or by more requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors. Our agreements with our franchisees require them to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.
 
Each restaurant requires appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell liquor, beer and wine, and each restaurant requires food service licenses from local health authorities. Our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our employees of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control. We are subject to various regulations by foreign governments related to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages and to health, sanitation and fire and safety standards. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.

Franchise regulation.
 
We must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and with several state and foreign laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (“FTC Rule”) and certain state and foreign laws require that we furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise disclosure document containing information prescribed by the FTC Rule and applicable state and foreign laws and regulations. We register the disclosure document in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that require registration for the sale of franchises. Our domestic franchise disclosure document complies with FTC Rule and various state disclosure requirements, and our international disclosure documents comply with applicable requirements.
 
We also must comply with a number of state and foreign laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. These laws may limit a franchisor’s ability to: terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause; interfere with the right of free association among franchisees; disapprove the transfer of a franchise; discriminate among franchisees with regard to charges, royalties and other fees; and place new stores near existing franchises. Bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into the United States Congress on several occasions during the last decade, but none have been enacted.
 
Employment regulations.
 
We are subject to state and federal labor laws that govern our relationship with our employees, such as minimum wage requirements, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements. Many of our employees are paid at rates which are influenced by changes in the federal and state wage regulations. Accordingly, changes in the wage regulations could increase our labor costs. The work conditions at our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and are subject to periodic inspections by this agency. In addition, the enactment of recent legislation and resulting new government regulation relating to healthcare benefits may result in additional cost increases and other effects in the future.
 
Gaming regulations.
 
We are also subject to regulations in Oregon where we operate gaming machines. Gaming operations are generally highly regulated and conducted under the permission and oversight of the state or local gaming commission, lottery or other government agencies.
 
Other regulations.
 
We are subject to a variety of consumer protection and similar laws and regulations at the federal, state and local level. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to financial and other penalties.
 
Seasonality
 
The sales of our restaurants may peak at various times throughout the year due to certain promotional events, weather and holiday related events. For example, our restaurants in South Africa generally peak in our winter months during their summer holidays. In contrast, our domestic fast casual restaurants tend to peak in the Spring, Summer and Fall months when the weather is milder. Quarterly results also may be affected by the timing of the opening of new stores and the closing of existing stores. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Corporate Information
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 7621 Little Avenue, Suite 414, Charlotte, NC 28226. Our web site is www.chanticleerholdings.com.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016, our locations had approximately 957 employees, including 306 in South Africa, 48 in the United Kingdom, and 603 in the United States. Approximately 70 of our South African employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppage and believe that our employee relationships are good.
