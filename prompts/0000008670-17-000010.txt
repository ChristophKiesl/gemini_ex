Item 1. Business
CORPORATE BACKGROUND
General
ADP was founded in 1949 on an innovative idea: to help business owners focus on core business activities by relieving them of certain administrative tasks such as payroll. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in June 1961 and completed its initial public offering in September 1961. A pioneer in business process outsourcing, today we are one of the world’s leading providers of human capital management (“HCM”) solutions to employers, offering solutions to businesses of all sizes, whether they have simple or complex needs. We serve approximately 700,000 clients in more than 110 countries and territories. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market® under the symbol “ADP.”
When we refer to “we,” “us,” “our,” “ADP,” or the “Company” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Employer Services’ Products and Services
Human Capital Management. In order to serve the unique needs of diverse types of businesses, ADP provides a range of solutions, via a software- and service-based delivery model, which businesses of all types and sizes can use to recruit, pay, manage, and retain employees.

ADP has also opened access to developers and system integrators to certain of our platforms’ Application Programming Interface libraries through the ADP Marketplace. With ADP Marketplace, clients can integrate employee data from ADP core services across their other business systems, providers or platforms. This access enables the exchange of client data housed in ADP's databases in order to create a unified HCM ecosystem for clients informed by a single repository of their workforce data.

• | Outside the United States, ADP offers comprehensive HCM solutions on local, country-specific platforms. These suites of services offer various combinations of payroll services, HR management, time and attendance management, talent management and benefits management, depending on the country in which the solution is provided.

Payroll Services. ADP pays approximately 26 million (approximately 1 out of every 6) workers in the United States, and approximately 13 million workers outside the United States. ADP provides flexible payroll services to employers of all sizes, including the preparation of employee paychecks, pay statements, supporting journals, summaries, and management reports. ADP provides employers with a wide range of payroll options, including entering their payroll data online with an Internet-based solution or via a mobile device, and outsourcing their entire payroll process to ADP. ADP also enables its clients to connect their major enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) applications with ADP’s payroll services. Employers can choose a variety of payroll payment options ranging from professionally printed checks to ADP’s electronic wage payment and, in the United States, payroll card solutions. On behalf of our clients in the United States, ADP prepares and files federal, state and local payroll tax returns and quarterly and annual Social Security, Medicare, and federal, state and local income tax withholding reports, and prepares and files similar reports internationally. In addition, as part of our payroll services globally, ADP supplies year-end regulatory and legislative tax statements and other forms to our clients’ employees. For those clients in the United States who choose to process payroll in-house, ADP also offers our Tax and Compliance Solutions described below.
Benefits Administration. In the United States, ADP provides flexible solutions for outsourced employee benefits administration. Employee benefits administration options in the United States include health and welfare administration, leave administration services, insurance carrier enrollment services, employee communication services, and dependent verification services. In addition, ADP benefits administration solutions offer employers an efficient cloud-based eligibility and enrollment system that provides their employees with tools, communications, and other resources they need to understand their benefits options and make informed choices.
Talent Management. ADP’s Talent Management solutions simplify and improve the talent acquisition, management, and activation process from recruitment to ongoing employee engagement and development. ADP’s talent acquisition solutions help employers recruit, screen and on-board talent quickly and cost effectively. Employers can also meet their hiring needs by outsourcing their internal recruitment function to ADP. ADP’s talent management solutions provide performance, learning, succession and compensation management tools that help employers align goals to outcomes, while enabling managers to identify and mitigate potential retention risks. ADP’s talent activation solutions include research-based tools that drive employee engagement and leadership development, which in turn help clients drive employee performance and reliably measure the impact in relation to business outcomes.
Human Resources Management. Commonly referred to as Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), ADP’s Human Resources Management Solutions provide employers with a single system of record to support the entry, validation, maintenance, and reporting of data required for effective HR management, including employee names, addresses, job types, salary grades, employment history, and educational background. ADP’s Human Resources Management Solutions can also be combined with ADP’s Talent Management Solutions and other HCM offerings.
Time and Attendance Management. ADP offers multiple options for employers of all sizes to collect employee time and attendance information, including electronic timesheets, badge cards, biometric and touch-screen time clocks, telephone/interactive voice response, and mobile smartphones and tablets. ADP’s time and attendance tracking tools simplify employee scheduling and automate the calculation and reporting of hours worked, helping employers consistently enforce leave and attendance policies, control overtime, and manage compliance with wage and hour regulations.
Insurance Services. ADP’s Insurance Services business, in conjunction with our licensed insurance agency, Automatic Data Processing Insurance Agency, Inc., facilitates access in the United States to workers’ compensation and group health insurance for small and mid-sized clients through a variety of insurance carriers. ADP’s automated Pay-by-Pay® premium payment program calculates and collects workers’ compensation premium payments each pay period simplifying this task for employers.
Retirement Services. ADP Retirement Services helps employers in the United States administer various types of retirement plans, such as 401(k) (including “safe harbor” 401(k) and Roth 401(k)), profit sharing (including new comparability), SIMPLE IRA, and executive deferred compensation plans. ADP Retirement Services offers a full service 401(k) plan program which provides recordkeeping and administrative services, combined with an investment platform offered through ADP Broker-Dealer, Inc. that gives our clients’ employees access to a wide range of non-proprietary investment options and online tools to monitor the performance of their investments. In addition, ADP Retirement Services offers investment management services to retirement plans through a subsidiary that is a registered investment adviser under the 
5

Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). ADP Retirement Services also offers trustee services through a third party.
Tax and Compliance Services
ADP SmartCompliance. In the United States, ADP SmartCompliance® integrates client data delivered from ADP's integrated HCM platforms or third-party payroll, HR and financial systems into a single, cloud-based platform enabling clients to consolidate their data in one location. ADP’s specialized teams use the data to work with clients to help them manage changing regulatory landscapes and improve business processes. ADP SmartCompliance integrates several HCM-related compliance processes, including health care reform under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (the "Affordable Care Act") employment tax, wage payments, tax credits, wage garnishments, unemployment claims, and employment verifications.
ADP SmartCompliance Employment Tax. As part of ADP’s employment tax services in the United States, ADP prepares and files employment tax returns on our clients’ behalf with federal, state, and local tax agencies. In connection with these services, ADP collects federal, state, and local employment taxes from clients and remits these taxes, as appropriate, to approximately 7,000 federal, state, and local tax agencies. ADP also responds to inquiries from tax agencies. In addition to our full-service employment tax solution, ADP offers a software solution for do-it-yourself employment tax management that can complement a client’s in-house payroll system. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”), ADP in the United States processed and delivered approximately 61 million employee year-end tax statements. In addition, we moved approximately $1.85 trillion in client funds to taxing and other agencies and to our clients’ employees and other payees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, and check.
ADP SmartCompliance Wage Payments. In the United States, in addition to ADPCheck, ADP’s traditional payroll check offering, ADP offers electronic payroll disbursement options that can be integrated with clients’ payroll systems and ERP applications. With ALINE Pay by ADP®, payroll can be disbursed via ALINE Check by ADP®, direct deposit, or the ALINE Card by ADP®, a network-branded payroll card. ALINE Check by ADP gives employees the ability to receive wages through a self-completed payroll check that can be negotiated just as a traditionally issued payroll check. Using the ALINE Card by ADP, employees can access their payroll funds immediately, including via a network member bank or an ATM, make purchases or pay bills, load additional funds onto the card, including government benefits or tax refunds, and transfer funds to a bank account in the United States.

6

MARKETS AND SALES
Employer Services’ HCM solutions are offered in more than 110 countries and territories. The most material markets for our HCM solutions are the United States, Canada and Europe. In each market, we have both country-specific solutions and multi-country solutions, for employers of all sizes and complexities. The major components of our HCM offerings throughout these geographies are payroll, HR outsourcing and time and attendance management. In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Australia, India, and China. PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States.
We market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. Employer Services also markets its solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and certified public accountants, among others. None of ADP’s major business groups has a single homogeneous client base or market. While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client, industry or industry group is material to ADP’s overall revenues. ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk.
COMPETITION
The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive. ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of HR outsourcing solutions in the world. Employer Services competes with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions. PEO Services competes with other PEOs providing similar services, 
7

as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions. Other competitive factors include a company’s in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems.
Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on service and product quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of services and products, and price. We believe that ADP is competitive in each of these areas and that our commitment to service excellence, together with our leading-edge technology, distinguishes us from our competitors.
INDUSTRY REGULATION
Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.
As one of the world’s largest providers of HR outsourcing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and data security-related laws, including federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data. The changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. In addition, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and ADP TotalSource.
As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients’ employees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, prepaid access and ADPCheck. Certain elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements. In addition, our U.S. prepaid access offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the “BSA”). Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar licensing and anti-money laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services. Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. ADP TotalSource is subject to various state licensing requirements and maintains certifications with the Internal Revenue Service. Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees, we may be subject to certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a rule which treats ADP Retirement Services as a “fiduciary” for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code in connection with certain services it provides. As a result, we have formed a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act that will provide certain investment management and advisory services under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and will be regulated as an investment adviser by the SEC.
In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services. For example, our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages. In addition, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States take advantage of tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits, which are subject to renewal, amendment or rescission.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences.

CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS
ADP provides its services to approximately 700,000 clients. In fiscal 2017, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of ADP’s annual consolidated revenues.
ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months). In some cases, the period may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation. Although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed, we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business. This metric is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients. In addition, some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years. However, this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of ADP’s expected future revenue, is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not used by management internally to estimate ADP’s future revenue.
Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP. ADP’s client retention is estimated at approximately 10 years in Employer Services, and approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its solutions and services. In general, new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and, given our recurring revenue model, do not have a material and immediate effect on ADP's revenues. ADP believes that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.
SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADP invested approximately $859 million, $818 million, and $767 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms, the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.
LICENSES
ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. ADP’s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP’s business as a whole.
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES
ADP employed approximately 58,000 persons as of June 30, 2017.
