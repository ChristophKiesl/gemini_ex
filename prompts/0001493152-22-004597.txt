Business Overview
 
We are a reporting issuer in Canada listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSX-V”) under the symbol “WMG.V”. Our common stock is also traded in the United States on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets (the “OTCQB”) under the symbol “MLYF” and in Germany on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “3WM”.
 
We have developed proprietary magnesium production technology with the aim of becoming a premier low-cost producer of green primary magnesium metal. We are in the final stages of construction and commencing test production of magnesium at a research and development pilot plant in metropolitan Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. We have commenced test production at this facility in the last calendar quarter of 2021with full pilot facility operations expected to commence in the second calendar quarter of 2022 after all safety testing is complete. Our proprietary technology utilizes a continuous silicothermic process that is expected to produce high grade magnesium with low labor and energy costs while generating minimal waste and toxic by-products.
 
In addition, we own a 100% interest in 81 unpatented lode mining claims totaling approximately 1,673 acres (the “Tami Mosi Mining Claim”), four unpatented lode mining claims totaling approximately 10 acres located in the Moor Mining District in Elco County, Nevada and a 100% interest in three patented mining claims located in the Pinto mining district of Nevada totaling approximately 296 acres (the “Silverado Mining Claim”). We do not plan on commencing extraction of minerals at this time from any mining claims we hold because we have identified alternative sources of supply of dolomite and ferrosilicon, the primary raw materials used to produce pure magnesium. We may in the future, however, commence extraction of minerals from the Tami Mosi Mining Claim if we are unable to purchase raw materials from the alternative sources we have identified at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, we do not consider our mining claims to be material to our business or financial condition.
 
General Development of Our Business
 
In 2006, we acquired the Silverado Mining Claim. During the year ended October 31, 2013, an impairment was recorded on this claim for $412,793 reducing its book value to $1.
 
In 2009, we acquired 27 mining claims totaling approximately 1,744 acres on property located southeast of Beaverdell, British Columbia (the “Beaverdell Mining Claim”). During the year ended October 31, 2013, an impairment was recorded on this claim for $335,133 reducing its book value to $1. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we sold our interest in the Beaverdell Mining Claim for $50,000 and recognized a gain on sale of $37,156.
 
On October 9, 2006, we acquired the Tami Mosi Mining Claims. On May 1, 2009, an Initial Resource Estimate was completed by Norm Tribe & Associates, Ltd. On June 11, 2010, a Phase 1 Process Development Study for Exploitation of the Tami Mosi Mining Claims was completed by Haze Research, Inc. On August 3, 2011, an updated resource estimate was completed by Tetra Tech, Inc. (“Tetra Tech”), on September 15, 2011 a Preliminary Economic Assessment and Technical Report of the Tami-Mosi Magnesium Project was completed by Tetra Tech and amended on July 4, 2014.
 
On April 4, 2017, we completed construction of a bench scale test furnace that employed our proprietary continuous silicothermic process and in October 2017, we successfully completed furnace preparations - a major milestone in the testing of our bench scale pilot furnace.
 
In November 2017, we completed “proof of concept” in the production of magnesium metal from our bench scale test furnace. The metal produced was a result from a partial test charge being conducted in order to identify any operational deficiencies in the furnace prior to a full charge test of dolime material.

In January 2018, we received a final assay report assessing the purity of the raw magnesium metal produced from our bench scale pilot furnace test program. In accordance with ASTM International standard ASTM E1479-16, the testing was analyzed via inductively coupled plasma (ICP). This unrefined magnesium metal was found to have a very good metal purity capable of producing ASTM B92 grade metal with minimal treatment. No impurities were found which would impact food grade applications.
 
In July 2018, we entered into an agreement with Industrial Surplus Ltd. (“ISL”) to build a silicothermic reduction furnace based on our bench scale test furnace.
 
In December 2018, our technical team produced a magnesium ingot from dolomite obtained from the Tami Mosi Mining Claims. This accomplishment completed the proof-of-concept stage allowing us to develop a pilot magnesium furnace based on the bench scale furnace.
 
Our Business
 
We have developed proprietary magnesium production technology with the aim of becoming a premier low-cost producer of green primary magnesium metal. We are in the final stages of construction and commencing test production at a research and development pilot plant in Metropolitan Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Our proprietary technology utilizes a continuous silicothermic process that is expected to produce high grade magnesium with low labor and energy costs while generating minimal toxic by-products.
Plan of Operations
 
In order to complete construction and commencing testing at our planned research and development pilot plant, the following are the key milestones that expect to achieve over the next 12 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

● | Complete construction of the plant; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commission the plant and complete final training of operations staff; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commence metal production under various scenarios to ensure sufficient data is collected; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Begin the request for proposal process for commercial engineering, procurement and construction management (“EPCM”) firm; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Select EPCM firm; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Review all pilot data with chosen EPCM firm and validate proposed required operational scenarios; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Begin geotechnical assessments of proposed full-scale magnesium production facility in Harrison County, Ohio. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We estimate that the costs to complete this work will be approximately $8,000,000. We have commenced production in the pilot reactor in the last calendar quarter of 2021 with full pilot facility operations expected to commence in the second calendar quarter of 2022 after all safety testing is complete.
 
Following completion of our magnesium research and development pilot plant, we intend to construct a full-scale magnesium production facility with expected capacity to produce 100,000 metric tons per year that will be scalable for greater production levels located on 122 acre property located in Harrison County, Ohio. The proposed plant will be adjacent to the future home of a modern mixed fuels power plant which is expected to provide power to our planned magnesium production plant. The proposed Harrison County, Ohio location is close to a dolomite supply and has an infrastructure of rail and highway that is capable of transporting our magnesium finished product to industries across the United States. Our plans will require a significant amount of additional capital.

Magnesium and Its Production
 
Magnesium is the lightest and strongest of the structural metals, just one-fourth the weight of steel, two-fifths the weight of titanium, and two-thirds the weight of aluminum. Magnesium has multiple industrial and consumer applications. Magnesium ingots are a prime raw material input for the production of titanium and aluminum alloys and magnesium alloys. Magnesium powder and granules are used to remove sulfur in the production of steel. Due to their unique light weight and high strength properties, magnesium alloys are used in a variety of aircraft and automobile parts, as well as in electronic equipment such as computers, cameras and cellular phones.
 
Most magnesium produced globally comes from natural minerals such as dolomite and magnesite in the form of magnesium carbonate. It can also be found in seawater and in salt lakes brines or underground mineral salt deposits. Magnesium can be produced through several different methods including the electrolytic process or thermal-reduction as practiced in the most commonly used Pidgeon process.
 
The electrolytic process involves the electrolysis of molten magnesium chloride which produces molten magnesium and chlorine. The metal is cast into ingots for further processing as needed and the chlorine by product may be sold for use in the production of polymers such as polyvinyl chloride pipe (PVC).
 
In the thermal-reduction method calcined magnesium containing ores (magnesite and dolomite) are broken down into fine powder and mixed with reducing agents and catalyst agent. The mixture is heated in a vacuum chamber producing magnesium vapors which later condense into crystals. The crystals are then melted, refined and poured into ingots for further processing.
 
The Pidgeon process, using ferrosilicon as s catalyst, is most commonly used for production of magnesium as its operation is relatively easy and has a low capital cost. The traditional process using horizontal retorts is high in energy consumption and has low productivity.
 
Dependence on Customers, Principal Products, or Services
 
Since we have not commenced production of magnesium and have no revenues, we are currently not dependent on any customers. In addition, we do not anticipate producing any significant quantities of magnesium until we launch a full-scale production facility following the launch and testing of our magnesium research and development pilot facility.
Competitive Conditions and Our Position
 
Magnesium production is highly competitive and is dominated by several large producers in China, the United States, Israel, Brazil, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey. Once we commence magnesium, we will compete with existing producers that may have greater resources, access to public equity markets, more experienced management or may be more mature as a business. Production costs associated with the energy needed to fuel the magnesium refinery and raw material costs are a significant challenge facing all producers. We believe that the more energy efficient proprietary silicothermic magnesium production technology we are developing will enable us to be competitive with other magnesium producers who use the less energy efficient electrolytic process or thermal-reduction as practiced in the most commonly used Pidgeon process that consumes significantly greater resources. Further, we believe we face competition from manufacturers of other products, such as aluminum alloys, steel, titanium, plastics, composites, ceramics, and glass, among others. Product quality, price and availability are important differentiating factors. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” We expect to face significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on expected revenues.”

Sources and Availability of Materials
 
As discussed above, we are currently in the final stages of developing a research and development pilot magnesium production facility and consequently have no current need to obtain dolomite and ferrosilicon, the primary raw materials used to produce pure magnesium. The production of magnesium products is dependent, however, on a number of key inputs and their related costs, including raw materials and supplies related to production, as well as electricity and other local utilities. Dolomite and ferrosilicon are in abundant supply in Canada, where our research and development pilot plant is being constructed, and the United States, where we intend to construct our full-scale production facility. Once we commence commercial production of magnesium, any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs, such as the raw material cost of dolomite and ferrosilicon, could, however, materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. We intend to purchase dolomite and ferrosilicon on a purchase order basis from local suppliers at market prices based on our production requirements. In addition, we believe there will be adequate availability of electricity needed to power our magnesium furnace and operate our production facility. Consequently, our management believes that we will have access to a sufficient supply of the key inputs for the foreseeable future.
 
Intellectual Property—Patents, Trademarks
 
We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our production process and methods. We rely on non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements and segregate development and engineering duties among certain members of our development team to protect our intellectual property rights. To the extent we describe or disclose our proprietary production techniques, we redact or request redaction of such information prior to public disclosure. Despite these measures, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. Effective trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to produce magnesium or offer our products for sale to the same extent as in the United States. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” with respect to intellectual property.
 
We own the website domain www.westernmagnesium.com and www.westmagcorp.com and social media accounts across certain major platforms.
 
We do not have any patents or trademarks nor have we filed any patent or trademark applications in the United States or Canada.
 
Regulation of Magnesium Production and Mining, Environmental Compliance
 
Our pilot magnesium production facility that we are currently developing in Metropolitan Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, will require local governmental approval before pilot operations can commence. We have applied for a business license, building permit, and all sub trade permits, which all have been issued along with a conditional business license. This license allows us to currently operate our Vancouver facility until we receive a final license which we expect to be issued in the first half of 2022 following a final inspection of the facility. A final inspection has been delayed due to a backlog in the permitting process due to COVID-19. Once operational, we will be subject to compliance with various types of government laws and regulations which often provide discretion to government authorities and could be interpreted, applied, or modified in ways to make our operations or compliance activities more costly. These laws and regulations include those relating to health and safety (WorkSafe BC, ASME, OSHA) (including those promulgated in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), competition, data privacy and security and environmental compliance. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Part I Item 1A of this prospectus.

Once we commence pilot magnesium production in Canada and mining in the U.S., we will be subject to extensive provincial environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, and greenhouse gas emissions. Since our planned pilot magnesium production facility is not currently operational, we have not incurred any material costs for compliance with environmental laws.
 
We believe our planned operations in Canada and the holding of mining claims in the U.S. comply with the current environmental protection requirements. We are not subject to any admonition, penalty, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators in Canada and the U.S., nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as a defendant for violation of any environmental laws and regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2021, we had 19 employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
