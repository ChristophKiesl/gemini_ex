ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History and Overview
 
History of Edge Data Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation
 
EDGE DATA SOLUTIONS, INC. (the “Company”), formerly Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc. (formerly Southeastern Holdings, Inc., formerly Safe Lane Systems, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. Safe Lane Systems, Inc. redomiciled to become a Delaware holding corporation in September of 2016. On September 22, 2016, Safe Lane Systems, Inc. formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, SLS Industrial, Inc and Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (both Delaware corporations) and on September 30, 2016 completed a merger and reorganization in which Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (now Edge Data Solutions, Inc.) became the holding company. On December 1, 2016, the Company spun off its wholly owned subsidiary, SLS Industrial, Inc., along with its assets and liabilities, leaving Southeastern Holdings, Inc. as the only surviving entity.
 
On August 23, 2018, the Company entered into a Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Blockchain Holdings, LLC (“BH LLC”) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the assets of BH LLC which are used in the business of sourcing of blockchain mining equipment from various suppliers for their customers and also providing management of the equipment hosted, mining pools and tech work on such equipment. The Company issued 300,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $.0001 valued at $300,000 to the members of Blockchain in exchange for the assets of Blockchain.
 
The Company accounted for this transaction as a reverse recapitalization under ASC 805, under which the operating entity, Blockchain Holdings, LLC, adopted the assets, liabilities and equity structure of Edge Data Solutions, Inc. on August 23, 2018, while retaining its historical activity. The financial statements therefore present activity beginning with Blockchain Holdings, LLC’s inception date of February 5, 2018 through September 30, 2018.
 
On August 30, 2018 the Company changed its name to Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc.
 
On January 13, 2020, the Company changed its name to Edge Data Solutions, Inc.
 
Edge Data Solutions, Inc believes it is poised to be an industry-leading infrastructure provider. In an increasingly data-driven world, GPU computing is changing the way we create, learn, and play. Through strategic partners, the Company has assembled a full-stack solution to help businesses realize the potential of CPU/GPU computing, backed by a rapidly growing network of high-density modular data centers that place compute directly at the point of data collection, reducing latency, improving performance and security.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. New business opportunities may never emerge, and we may not be able to sufficiently fund the pursuit of new business opportunities should they arise.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $831,209 in cash on hand. Our current monthly operating cash requirement is approximately $170,000, and it is expected that rate will continue and will increase as we execute on our business plan. There can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient revenues, profits and cash to cover operating costs.

Growth Strategy
 
According to the IDC Data Age 2025 report, nearly 30% of data by 2025 will require real-time processing. Data consumption shows no signs of slowing down and this ever-increasing demand will need to be addressed at a hyper-local level. EDSI’s scalable high-density immersion-cooled technology solutions, which can be deployed rapidly and cost effectively with the ability to provide high density data delivery at the edge, are an effective method to roll out capacity and meet growing demand.
 
To meet this demand, EDSI plans to continue development of and sell its EPP and focus on relationships and growth in the cryptocurrency mining and enterprise spaces. Further, EDSI plans to deploy its next-generation immersion-cooled edge data centers to strategic locations based on demand, such as real estate properties, Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, outside of major metropolitan areas, and underserved markets. With the rise and proliferation of technology adoption across many devices, we seek to solidify our footprint by deepening our relationships with enterprise customers, developing strategic partnerships and securing multiple locations across the US.
