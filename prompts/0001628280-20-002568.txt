ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.® (the “Company” or “we” or “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the areas of thrombosis, other hematologic diseases and inflammation for patients who currently have limited or no approved treatment options. Our headquarters is located in South San Francisco, California.
Our lead product is Andexxa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo] which we are marketing under the brand name of Ondexxya in Europe. Andexxa is the first and only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the European Commission (“EC”) for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. We are conducting clinical trials with cerdulatinib, an investigational oral, dual spleen tyrosine kinase (“SYK”) and Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor to treat hematologic cancers.

Cerdulatinib | Oral, dual Syk and JAK inhibitor | Relapsed/refractory B- and T-cell malignancies | Phase 2a | Worldwide excluding topical formulation in non-oncology indications

Our strategy
We are building a global biopharmaceutical company, focusing our efforts and resources on marketing Andexxa in the United States and Europe while we conduct additional clinical trials to obtain full regulatory approvals and expand approved indications. Additionally, we are conducting clinical trials for cerdulatinib as we pursue partnering opportunities or other strategic transactions. 
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Pursue and prioritize the commercial launch of Andexxa in the United States and Ondexxya in Europe;


• | Increase engagement with medical, scientific and academic professionals and associations to establish Andexxa as the standard of care for treating life-threatening Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeds;


• | Continue to build our European operations and execute a phased launch of Ondexxya in Europe, with an initial focus on Germany, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (together, the "Wave 1 Countries");


• | Launch Ondexxya in France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Ireland and other countries yet to be determined (together, the "Wave 2 Countries");


• | Develop clinical data supporting full approvals for Andexxa in the United States and Ondexxya in Europe;


• | Pursue additional regulatory approvals for Andexxa, including reversal of additional anticoagulants such as edoxaban and enoxaparin, and reversal of Factor Xa inhibitors for emergency surgery/urgent procedures;


• | Establish and improve reimbursement and market access for Andexxa/Ondexxya;


• | Support our commercial marketing partners Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company (“BMS”) and Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) to advance the development and commercialization of Andexxa for the Japanese market; and


• | Advance development of cerdulatinib for the treatment of hematologic cancers while pursuing partnering opportunities or other strategic transactions.

Approved Products
Andexxa
Andexxa is approved by the FDA as a reversal agent for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Andexxa was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval pathway based on the change from baseline in anti-Factor Xa activity in healthy volunteers. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon post-marketing study results that verify that clinical benefit is conferred to patients. 
We are conducting a randomized controlled trial of Andexxa (U.S.)/Ondexxya (EU) against a usual care cohort control arm (known as "ANNEXA-I") to provide clinical data supporting full approval. ANNEXA-I was initiated in early 2019 and we anticipate that it will include approximately 440 patients with intracranial hemorrhage and compare outcomes of patients treated with Andexxa to the usual care on a 1:1 randomized scheme. We plan to conduct this study globally with our expected completion date in 2023. We are also conducting the ANNEXA-S study: a single-arm, open-label clinical trial in approximately 200 patients enrolled from approximately 80 hospitals worldwide. ANNEXA-S will evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients requiring urgent surgery while taking apixaban, edoxaban, enoxaparin, or rivaroxaban. The primary endpoint of ANNEXA-S is hemostatic efficacy, as assessed by intraoperative assessment of hemostasis. The study is expected to be completed in 2022.
In the U.S., we initially received approval from the FDA in May 2018 to market product manufactured under our Gen 1 process using the clinical-scale process at the facility that produced material for our clinical trials. We conducted a limited launch in the second half of 2018 through an Early Supply Program (“ESP”) intended to reach hospitals with a large number of patients with Factor Xa bleeds and who were able to start using Andexxa during the ESP period. On December 31, 2018, the FDA approved our Gen 2 manufacturing process, which provides commercial scale volume that we believe is sufficient to support a global launch. In early January 2019, we began shipping Gen 2 product and commenced a full-scale commercial launch in the U.S.. 
Andexanet alfa received conditional approval under the brand name Ondexxya by the EC on April 26, 2019. This conditional approval included several post-authorization requirements, including specific obligations to submit a final clinical study report for ANNEXA-I, a final clinical study report for the ANNEXA-4 study, and an obligation to provide some additional pharmacokinetic data.
We completed our first sales of Ondexxya in Europe in July 2019 and are executing a phased launch of Ondexxya in Europe, with an initial focus on the Wave 1 Countries. We also intend to launch Ondexxya in the Wave 2 countries and establish an early access program for Ondexxya through a distribution partner. We launched in the EU using Gen 2 product in July 2019.
In May 2019, we announced a new analysis of the ANNEXA-4 study among patients with spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracranial hemorrhage - a bleeding event in the brain not caused by trauma and associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The data presented demonstrate that, even among this important and difficult-to-treat subset of patients, the hemostatic efficacy and safety of Andexxa is compelling and consistent. Specifically, the data show:

• | A high rate of hemostatic efficacy (79%) consistent with that of the full ANNEXA-4 trial across patients with all types of bleeds (82%);


• | Of the patients that achieved excellent or good hemostatic efficacy within one hour-post Andexxa administration, 98% (n=55/56) maintained excellent or good hemostatic control 12 hours following Andexxa administration;


• | The majority of thrombotic events occurred in patients who delayed or did not re-start anticoagulation therapy with a Factor Xa inhibitor during the follow-up period; and


• | No thrombotic events were observed among the 18 patients who re-started oral anticoagulation therapy within 30 days.

Andexxa is administered almost exclusively in the hospital and urgent care setting and is reimbursed either under Medicare Part A through an applicable Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group ("MS-DRG") payment related to the patient condition for inpatient use, or separately reimbursed under a C code through Medicare with respect to outpatient usage covered by Medicare Part B based on Average Sales Price. In addition, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") has supplemented Part A reimbursement with a New Technology Add-on Payment ("NTAP"), which was first effective in October 2018 at a maximum of 50% of wholesale acquisition cost ("WAC") for the standard dose, and increased in October 2019 to a maximum of 65% of WAC. The actual NTAP amount will vary based on the amount by which the cost of a case exceeds the MS-DRG payment. The CMS NTAP program was created by Congress to support timely access to innovative therapies used to treat Medicare beneficiaries in the hospital inpatient setting. For a new technology to qualify for an add-on payment, it must meet the NTAP definition of "new," demonstrate a substantial clinical improvement and meet specific cost thresholds.
The worldwide use of Factor Xa inhibitors is rapidly growing because of their efficacy and safety profile compared to warfarin and enoxaparin in preventing and treating thromboembolic conditions such as stroke, pulmonary embolism and venous 
thromboembolism ("VTE"). This growth has come with a proportional increase in the incidence of hospital admissions and deaths related to bleeding, the major complication of anticoagulation. In 2018, in the United States, there were approximately 150,000 hospital admissions attributable to Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding. We believe that Andexxa has the potential to act as a universal reversal agent for all direct and indirect Factor Xa inhibitors. We plan to continue clinical development to support global approvals as a reversal agent for other Factor Xa inhibitors. In addition, we plan to continue clinical development to support global approvals for reversal of the anticoagulant effects in Factor Xa inhibitor-treated patients who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures.
We hold worldwide commercial rights to Andexxa with the exception of Japan. In 2016, we entered into collaboration agreements with BMS and Pfizer whereby BMS and Pfizer will seek to obtain Japanese regulatory approval and to commercialize Andexxa in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement we received an upfront payment of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive potential regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to $90.0 million, as well as tiered single-digit to double-digit royalties based on net sales in Japan. BMS and Pfizer obtained the rights to develop and commercialize Andexxa in Japan and will be responsible for all development, regulatory and commercialization activities. Under the terms of the agreement, BMS and Pfizer will purchase drug from us at cost for both clinical studies and, upon approval, commercial sales in Japan.
Bevyxxa
Bevyxxa was the first anticoagulant approved in the United States for hospital and extended duration prophylaxis of VTE in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE. Bevyxxa was approved by the FDA in June 2017 and we commenced the commercial launch in the United States in January 2018.
Following the approval of Andexxa in May 2018, we made the business decision to focus our resources on the launch of Andexxa and significantly scaled back our commercial efforts on Bevyxxa. Throughout 2019, we engaged with potential business collaborators for Bevyxxa, and in the fourth quarter of 2019, we determined that it was unlikely that we will find a viable partner. Accordingly, we have begun to wind down Bevyxxa operations to eliminate future operational and financial obligations. 
Product Candidates:
Cerdulatinib
Cerdulatinib is our investigational SYK and Janus kinase ("JAK") inhibitor that uniquely inhibits two key cell signaling pathways implicated in certain hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. There is a rationale for inhibiting both SYK (B-cell receptor pathway) and JAK (cytokine receptors) in B-cell malignancies where both targets have been shown to promote cancer cell growth and survival. In addition, pre-clinical data suggest an important role for SYK and JAK in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (“PTCL”) tumor survival.
There is a significant unmet need for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL. Current approved therapies for relapsed/refractory PTCL are all given via IV infusion and have limited activity with overall response rates of approximately 30%. In addition, most of these responses are partial responses. Based on the unmet need and on the activity to date with cerdulatinib, we have prioritized development in PTCL. Following our End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in January 2019, the FDA requested additional data supporting the proposed dose and we submitted the requested data. We have reached an agreement with the FDA on the design of a registration study ("CELTIC-1").
In December 2019, we presented new interim Phase 2a data for cerdulatinib in heavily pre-treated T-cell malignancies at the American Society of Hematology ("ASH") Annual Meeting. Patients with PTCL exhibited a 34% overall response rate and a subset of those patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ("AITL") exhibited an overall response rate of 52% and a complete response of 37%. Additionally, patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ("CTCL") exhibited a 43% overall response rate. Cerdulatinib demonstrated good tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL patients. Additionally, we presented interim Phase 2a data for cerdulatinib alone and in combination with rituximab in Follicular Lymphoma ("FL") patients at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2019. Data among patients in the single-agent cerdulatinib arm demonstrated consistent clinical activity (including a 48% overall response rate) and good tolerability of cerdulatinib with no evidence of cumulative toxicity. The combination of cerdulatinib with rituximab resulted in improved response rates (including a 76% overall response rate) with a similar safety profile when compared to the data from the single-agent cerdulatinib arm. Follow-up analysis of these cohorts is ongoing.
The FDA granted cerdulatinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PTCL in September 2018. The FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan status to support development of medicines for the treatment of rare diseases. Orphan Drug Designation may provide certain benefits, including a seven-year period of market exclusivity if the drug is approved, tax credits for qualified clinical trials and an exemption from FDA market application fees. 
In December 2016, we licensed worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of cerdulatinib in topical applications beyond oncology to Dermavant Sciences GmbH (“Dermavant”), a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences. We retain full rights to all non-topical formulations, including oral formulations.  Dermavant is evaluating cerdulatinib as a topical treatment option for vitiligo and other inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Dermavant has presented Phase 1 results with topical cerdulatinib in atopic dermatitis patients and in December 2019 announced that the first patient was dosed in its Phase 2a vitiligo clinical trial.
Other Early Stage Programs
We continue to progress certain early discovery activities that align with our scientific expertise.
Sales and marketing
We target our U.S. sales and marketing efforts at the approximately 2,100 target accounts that would account for the large majority of the prescribing base for Andexxa. We market Andexxa in the United States using a hospital-based sales force. This sales force is supported by an experienced sales leadership team of regional sales managers and account managers, and our commercial team comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, marketing research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. In the EU, during 2019 we established commercial operations to launch Ondexxya in the Wave 1 Countries and are establishing operations to market Ondexxya in Wave 2 Countries. Hospitals in Europe can purchase our products directly from Portola (Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) or indirectly from wholesale distributors (Sweden, Finland and Denmark). Outside of these countries, we also expect to establish an early access program for Ondexxya through a distribution partner. To achieve global commercialization, we anticipate using a variety of distribution agreements and commercial partnerships in those territories where we do not establish our own sales force. 
Customers
Our products are purchased in the United States and Europe primarily by hospitals. U.S. hospitals purchase our products through a network of specialty and wholesale distributors and EU hospitals purchase directly from Portola and, to a lesser extent, distributors. We do not believe that the loss of one of these distributors would significantly impact our ability to distribute our product, as we expect that sales volume would be absorbed by the remaining distributors. 
Other Key Licenses and Collaborations
As part of our business strategy, we establish collaborations with other companies, universities and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also evaluate opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies, universities and medical research institutions. For more information regarding certain of these relationships, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, see Note 3, "Revenue Recognition" and Note 7, "Asset Acquisition and License Agreements" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Andexxa

• | BMS and Pfizer

We have worked in collaboration with BMS and Pfizer to study Andexxa as a reversal agent for their jointly-owned, FDA-approved oral Factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, since the inception of our Phase 2 proof-of-concept in 2012. We remain actively engaged with both parties as part of the 2016 collaboration and license agreement whereby BMS and Pfizer obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Andexxa in Japan. BMS and Pfizer are responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities in Japan and we will reimburse BMS and Pfizer for expenses they incur for research and development activities specific to Factor Xa inhibitors other than apixaban. Pursuant to this agreement, we are obligated to provide certain research and development activities outside of Japan, provide clinical drug supply and related manufacturing services and to participate on various committees in exchange for a non-refundable upfront fee of $15.0 million. We are also eligible to receive contingent payments totaling up to $20.0 million which may be earned upon achievement of certain regulatory events and up to $70.0 million which may be earned upon achievement of specified annual net sales volumes in Japan. We are also entitled to receive royalties ranging from 5% to 15% on net sales of Andexxa in Japan. Under this agreement, we have agreed to provide Andexxa to BMS and Pfizer at cost in order to supply clinical and commercial demand in Japan.

• | Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (“Daiichi Sankyo”)

In 2013, we entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to include subjects dosed with edoxaban, its Factor Xa inhibitor product, in our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of Andexxa. In July 2014, we entered into a second collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to perform the necessary development and regulatory activities to support potential U.S. and EU regulatory approval of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent for edoxaban. Under this Phase 3 collaboration agreement we received an upfront payment of $15.0 million. To date, we have received $5.0 million in milestone payments and are eligible to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $2.5 million. In 2016, we amended the 2014 agreement to expedite development activities in exchange for $15.0 million and a net increase in total eligible milestones of $7.5 million. We have received $7.0 million in milestone payments under this amended agreement. This amended collaboration agreement will continue in force until the approval of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent for edoxaban by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency ("EMA").
In 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to include edoxoban in the clinical studies necessary for approval of Andexxa in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in additional milestone payments based on Japanese regulatory approval of Andexxa as an antidote for edoxaban.

• | Bayer Pharma, AG ("Bayer").

In 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer to include rivaroxaban in the clinical studies necessary for approval of Andexxa in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $5.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in additional milestone payments based on Japanese regulatory approval of Andexxa as an antidote for rivaroxaban.
Other Programs

• | We have a number of licenses and collaborations with several partners - Takeda, Ora, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc.

Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies.
Andexxa
Apart from Andexxa, there are currently no therapies approved as antidotes for Factor Xa inhibitors. However, Andexxa competes with off-label treatments to attenuate bleeding including Fresh Frozen Plasma (“FFP”), 4-factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (“PCCs”), recombinant activated Factor VII (“rFVIIa”), Vitamin K, protamine and whole blood. In addition, several companies have conducted clinical research on compounds that are intended to reverse the effects of one or more direct Factor Xa inhibitors which, if developed and approved, may be competitive with Andexxa.
Cerdulatinib
In the market for the treatment of FL, PTCL and CTCL, cerdulatinib, if approved, will compete with existing therapies (used as a single agent or in combination with other therapies), such as rituximab and obinutuzumab which are marketed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd and Genentech, Inc., idelalisib, which is marketed by Gilead Sciences Inc., brentuximab, which is marketed by Seattle Genetics, Inc. and Takeda,  copanlisib, which is marketed by Bayer AG, duvelisib, which is marketed by Verastem, Inc., lenalidomide and romidepsin, which are marketed by Celgene Corporation (a subsidiary of BMS), pralatrexate and belinostat, which are marketed by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., mogamulizumab, which is marketed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin; and potentially other therapies currently in development by a number of different companies.
Intellectual property
Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our drug candidates, including composition-of-matter, dosage and formulation patents, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and other important technology inventions and know-how. In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see the section of this Annual Report entitled “Risk factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Andexanet alfa
Our Factor Xa inhibitor antidote patent portfolio is wholly owned by us and includes 13 issued U.S. patents and 11 U.S. patent applications covering the composition of and methods of making and using andexanet alfa or its analogs.  We retain full commercialization rights to andexanet alfa on a worldwide basis except for Japan where commercial rights have been licensed to BMS and Pfizer.
The last to expire of the U.S. patents relating to the composition of matter is not expected to expire before June 2030. Related international patent applications have issued in 45 countries, and additional related international patent applications are pending. These international patents and patent applications, if issued, would not be due to expire before September 2028. Several other international patent applications have issued in Europe, Japan and other countries, and international patent applications are still pending in Europe and a number of other countries.
Betrixaban
Our betrixaban patent portfolio includes 24 issued U.S. patents and five U.S. patent applications covering the composition of and methods of making and using betrixaban or its analogs, including those owned by us and those licensed from Takeda. The U.S. issued patents relating to the composition of matter of betrixaban are not due to expire before September 2020 and may be extended up to September 2025, if betrixaban receives the patent term extension we have timely petitioned with the U.S. Patent Office, pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Related international patent applications have issued in 39 countries. These related international patents would not be due to expire before September 2020.
In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years for one patent related to an approved therapy. We believe that we are eligible for a full five-year patent term extension for one patent relating to betrixaban.
In addition, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides that the period of patent exclusivity for a drug may be extended for six months if the owner of the drug conducts studies of the drug in children pursuant to a request from the FDA. We have commenced a pediatric study of bextrixaban in the United States.
Cerdulatinib
Our dual SYK-JAK inhibitor patent portfolio is owned in part by us and licensed in part from Astellas and includes six issued U.S. patents covering the composition of and methods of making and using cerdulatinib or its analogs. The last to expire of the U.S. patents is not expected to expire before July 2029. Related international patent applications have issued in 51 countries and a related patent application is pending in Brazil. 
Trademarks
We plan to market all of our products under a trademark or trademarks we select and we will own all rights, title and interest, including goodwill, associated with such trademarks. In the United States, Andexxa, Annexa, Bevyxxa and Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our logo are our registered trademarks. The Ondexxya trademark has been registered in the United States and in the EU. Andexxa and Ondexxya are our registered trademarks in Japan.
Manufacturing
We rely exclusively on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture our drugs and drug candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive U.S. and foreign regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that our current agreements and purchase orders with third-party manufacturers provide for sufficient operating capacity to support anticipated commercial and clinical supply needs for the next several years.
Andexxa
Andexxa is a recombinant biologic molecule produced in living cells, a process that is inherently complex and requires specialized knowledge and extensive process optimization and product characterization to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes.
Primary commercial manufacturing of Andexxa bulk drug substance is conducted at Lonza AG (“Lonza”). Drug product manufacturing is conducted at Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC (“Baxter”). We expect that future clinical studies of Andexxa will also be conducted primarily using product manufactured by these third party-manufacturing organizations. We also rely on other third-party manufacturers for packaging, testing and shipping.
Government regulation
Healthcare and reimbursement regulation
Our research, sales, marketing, promotion, medical education and other activities are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) including the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and state and local governments. Our marketing, promotional, and scientific/educational programs and interactions with health care professionals, patients, third-party payers, pharmacies, distributors and others must comply with, among other laws, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act and analogous state laws, federal and state false claims laws including the federal civil False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, federal and state price reporting laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and federal and state transparency laws. 
Our interactions with health care professionals, third-party payers, patients, distributors, pharmacies and others are subject to scrutiny and enforcement under one or more federal or state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which could affect our ability to operate our business, including:
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, payers, and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product and reimbursement support and patient assistance programs.
The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by private individuals in the name of the government, who may then share in any monetary recovery. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for 
a variety of alleged improper activities including causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable uses, inflating prices reported to private price publication services which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs, and other interactions with prescribers and other customers including those that may have affected their billing or coding practices and submission to the federal government. Because of the potential for treble monetary damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of significant potential damages and penalties that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Settlements may require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
State law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that restrict certain marketing-related activities and require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing or laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
Violations of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations are punishable by significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment of individuals, damages, fines, government-imposed remediation programs and exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and the product candidates that we develop may not ultimately be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a 
specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with products administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available on a timely basis, or at all, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act and uncertainty regarding various constitutional and other legal challenges to the Act, will likely continue to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, review the differences between domestic and international pricing for drug products and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
Reporting and Other Obligations Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Other Federal Programs
We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being available for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data we are required to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment obligations could negatively impact our financial results, as described in the risk factor entitled “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations” in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report.
We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and, as a result, federal law requires us to also participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), requires us to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the 
Medicaid rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation or regulation could lower our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations. 
HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation. HRSA also has implemented a reporting requirement pursuant to which we are required to report the 340B ceiling prices for our drugs to HRSA every quarter. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
Federal law also requires that companies participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. 
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also are required to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), pricing program. As part of this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard).
The FCP is based on the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP), which we are required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS pricing and contracting obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. For additional information regarding obligations under federal health care programs, refer to the risk factor entitled “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations” in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report.
Foreign healthcare regulation
The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country. Some countries, including many EU member countries, require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, including EU member countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. In some foreign markets, including some EU member countries, current standard of care and/or competitive products may be used as a benchmark or reference to determine pricing and reimbursement level for novel products such as Andexxa. To the extent that comparators are available at lower prices than our anticipated pricing for Andexxa, the pricing and reimbursement level of our products in the EU and other foreign markets could be negatively impacted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country, or even reduce the commercial viability of the product to an extent that prevents the launch altogether.
Clinical Development, Marketing Approvals and Commercialization of Prescription Drug Products
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Numerous agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products.
The process required by the regulatory authorities before product candidates may be marketed generally involves:

• | nonclinical laboratory and animal testing of the product;


• | submission of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug for its intended use;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with manufacturing and clinical practice standards; and


• | Approval of a marketing application prior to commercial marketing for specific indications.

These steps require substantial time, effort and financial resources. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase 1 - Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.


• | Phase 2 - Studies are conducted with patients with a specified disease or condition to provide data regarding preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted.


• | Phase 3 - Clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dose, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product compared to placebo or current standard of care and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.


• | The regulatory authorities may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. The results of post-marketing studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information gathered in routine medical practice. Their failure to do so can result in adverse consequences for the product and the company. 

In addition, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing in accordance with regulatory manufacturing requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches and, among other things, the sponsor must also develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to establish an appropriate shelf life for the drug.
Under EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products and certain other innovative medical products and is optional for certain other medicinal products, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. For drugs without approval in a EU member state, the decentralized procedure provides for assessment of a marketing application by one-member state, known as the reference member state, and review and possible approval of that assessment by one or more other, or concerned, member states. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of related materials. Each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. The decentralized procedure must be completed within 210 days, excluding potential clock-stops, during which the applicant can respond to questions. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states. It is also possible to apply for a marketing authorization in one EU member state only, which could thereafter serve as a reference medicinal product for obtaining marketing authorization in one or more other EU Member States through a mutual recognition procedure.
Post-approval requirements and enforcement 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Our contracted third-party drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the regulatory authorities and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by them, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with regulatory manufacturing regulations and other regulatory requirements. If our suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the regulatory authorities may halt our manufacturing or clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the marketing application.
Andexxa was granted an Accelerated Approval by the FDA with a requirement for a post-marketing study to verify and describe Andexxa’s clinical benefit via an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of Andexxa in acute intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving oral Factor Xa inhibitors. In the EU, marketing authorization was granted for Ondexxya in 2019, subject to several post-approval commitments, including an obligation to submit a final clinical study report from the randomized controlled trial of Ondexxya and an obligation to provide some additional pharmacokinetic data.
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or clinical practices associated with the product through adverse event monitoring and reporting or otherwise, or the failure to comply with applicable FDA or foreign regulatory requirements, can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, administrative enforcement, warning or untitled letters from the FDA or foreign regulators, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs, and a company’s failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such “off-label uses” are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use.
Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, False Claims Act actions, including “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, administrative actions, or integrity oversight and reporting obligations. Separately, FDA has authority to regulate the manufacturing of drug products, and failure to comply with good manufacturing practices can result in total or partial suspension of production, enforcement actions including import alerts, and suspension of regulatory review of a pending application.

Legal proceedings
On January 16, 2020, a stockholder filed a putative class action against the Company and certain officers (the “Defendants”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned Hayden v. Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 3:20-cv-00367-VC (N.D. Cal.).  On February 7, 2020, another stockholder filed a related putative class action against Defendants, captioned McCutcheon v. Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al., No. 3:20-cv-00949 (N.D. Cal.).  
The stockholder plaintiffs allege that the Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act by making misrepresentations and omissions in public disclosures concerning the Company’s sales of andexanet alfa, marketed as Andexxa in the United States and Ondexxya in Europe, between May 8, 2019 and January 9, 2020.  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements about the demand for Andexxa, and usage of Andexxa by hospitals and healthcare organizations.  Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements about the Company’s accounting for its reserve for returns, and that the Defendants failed to disclose that the Company was shifting from a short-dated version of Andexxa to a longer-dated version, impacting the reserve for returns and impacting revenue for the Company. The Plaintiffs contend that the alleged fraud was revealed on January 9, 2020, when the Company announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019.  A lead plaintiff has not yet been appointed, and the Company has not yet responded to the complaints.
The plaintiffs seek to recover unspecified monetary relief, interest, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  Given the early stage of these proceedings, we cannot presently predict the likelihood of obtaining dismissal of the case, nor can we estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time.
