ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Pear is a commercial-stage healthcare company pioneering a new class of software-based medicines, sometimes referred to as Prescription Digital Therapeutics (“PDTs”), which use software to treat diseases directly. Our vision is to advance healthcare through the widespread use of PDTs, and to be the one-stop shop for PDTs offered both by Pear and by other organizations that may choose to host their products on our commercial platform. 
Recent global trends are converging to highlight a significant unmet need for new and innovative solutions for the treatment of diseases. We believe that our software-based, data-driven solutions are well suited to satisfy this growing unmet need for treatment of diseases, including addiction and insomnia. We believe that PDTs have the potential to become a cornerstone of the emerging digital health ecosystem and that PDTs are a transformative new generation of therapeutics. 
We believe that Pear’s platform has the potential to provide for discovery, development, and commercialization of PDTs at scale. We have designed our development platform to allow for the repeated advancement of PDTs through U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) market authorization. Over time, our commercial platform, PearConnect, is similarly designed to offer the infrastructure needed to distribute PDTs developed by us or others. Due to our first-mover advantage, we believe that Pear is positioned to be a long-term leader in this novel therapeutic class. 
Pear is one of the category creators and leaders of the PDT industry, as evidenced by being the first company to receive FDA market authorization for a PDT. Our marketed PDTs, reSET, reSET-O and Somryst, were among the first three PDTs authorized by FDA and address psychiatric indications, an area with significant unmet need. 
Two of Pear’s FDA-authorized PDTs treat addiction, which currently affects more than 20 million people in the United States (“US”). 
Pear’s first product, reSET, is indicated for the treatment of substance use disorder (“SUD”) as a monotherapy. To combat SUD, reSET works to enhance patient abstinence, improve patient treatment retention relative to human intervention-based alternatives, and extend clinicians’ reach outside of scheduled office visits. reSET’s mechanisms of action seek to directly modify addiction-related neurocircuitry and induce dopamine in the brain, a process with the potential to repair dysfunctional neurophysiology. 
Pear’s second product, reSET-O, is the first PDT to receive FDA Breakthrough Designation, and is FDA-authorized for treatment of opioid use disorder (“OUD”) in combination with buprenorphine. Approximately 1.6 million Americans suffer from OUD annually in the US, and approximately 50,000 Americans die each year from opioid overdose. To combat OUD, reSET-O works alongside buprenorphine to reduce dependence on opioids, and, similar to reSET, to improve patient treatment adherence and extend clinicians’ reach outside of scheduled office visits. 
Pear’s third product, Somryst, is the only software-based, FDA-authorized, and guideline-recommended treatment for chronic insomnia. Chronic insomnia is estimated to affect approximately 30 million people in the US. In addition to adversely affecting quality of life, chronic insomnia can also give rise to other serious and life-threatening medical conditions. Many patients turn to sleep medications to combat their chronic insomnia. Most available sleep medications are only recommended for short-term use due to their habit-forming side effects, and, as a result, are not a long-term solution to treat chronic insomnia. We believe that the lack of a convenient and effective solution for chronic insomnia represents a significant unmet medical need that Somryst can help address to reduce the occurrence of chronic insomnia. 
We believe that PDTs have the potential to directly treat a breadth of additional diseases beyond our initial products for the treatment of addiction and insomnia, including the diseases listed in the graphic below. To capitalize on this potential, Pear has developed a robust pipeline of PDTs for a variety of additional indications across psychiatry, neurology, and other therapeutic areas. Pear currently has a pipeline of 14 PDT product 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 4


candidates, as well as the infrastructure and knowledge base needed to continue to expand upon this pipeline, which we believe has the potential to deliver more than one hundred PDTs.
Note: Diseases show above are potential medication conditions that PDTs could address in the future. 
The Prescription Digital Therapeutic Opportunity 
For decades, innovations have expanded the classes of therapeutics to treat disease, from small molecules starting in the 1900s to biologics starting in the late 1970s to cell and gene therapies starting around 2000. This collective innovation has resulted in consistent improvement of health outcomes around the world. Still, across numerous disease states, limited treatment options and substantial barriers to access persist. These barriers include excessive cost, conditions that are difficult to treat with drugs, geographic inaccessibility, and unfavorable side effect profiles. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 5


Pear is advancing PDTs, a novel class of therapeutics, which are software that can be prescribed by a clinician, either alone or in combination with drugs, to treat disease directly. We believe that PDTs are a transformative new class of medicines. 
Similar to pharmaceuticals, novel PDTs undergo rigorous clinical development via clinical trials designed to seek FDA authorization to safely and effectively treat disease. Similar to wellness apps, PDTs utilize digital technology to remotely interface with patients. PDTs are designed to expand access and convenience for patients, improve reach for clinicians, and reduce cost for payors by reducing and/or augmenting human intervention, providing for more efficient care, and by ideally improving clinical outcomes. 
Currently, the medical community is embracing the integration of software into the navigation and delivery of care. Payors are increasingly recognizing the near- and long-term cost benefit of using software for treatment of diseases. The pervasiveness of technology and growth of telehealth allows for virtual access that was not previously available. As the category creator and leader in PDTs, Pear is defining and expanding the opportunities in this market due to factors which include, but are not limited to: 
•being the first mover and leader in the PDT space, defining the industry via the first three FDA-authorized products.
•having products in major markets, with reSET and reSET-O for the treatment of addiction, and Somryst for the treatment of chronic insomnia, with the potential to address, in the aggregate, more than 50 million US patients and more than 850 million patients worldwide.
•having a deep and broad pipeline of PDTs, with 14 product candidates with the potential to redefine care across a range of therapeutic areas via diverse mechanisms of action.
•having the first scalable end-to-end platform to discover, develop, and deliver PDTs to patients, creating the horizontal infrastructure to enable our PDTs, and potentially those of other companies, to come to market and be delivered to patients. Pear’s platform also has the potential to integrate into care delivery and payor infrastructure with virtuous network effects and modularity, facilitating speed and scale in PDT deployment.
•demonstrating adoption by patients, clinicians, and payors, which could be leveraged across various future opportunities.
Products and Pipeline 
PDTs are software applications authorized by FDA that are intended to treat disease. PDTs are designed to be prescribed by clinicians, reimbursed by third-party payors, and used by patients to improve clinical outcomes as part of a patient’s care, similar to FDA approved medications and medical devices. PDTs are authorized to deliver evidence-based mechanisms-of-action, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, contingency management, and exposure therapy, that the patient engages with on their mobile device and may be used alone or in combination with medications. The value of Pear’s FDA-authorized PDTs is supported by evidence demonstrating safety and 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 6


clinical effectiveness in randomized control trials, collected data on PDT usage and clinical outcomes in real-world data, and health economic value. 
We believe PDTs can be utilized in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. Pear’s first three FDA-authorized products address behavioral health indications: 
•reSET is authorized in the US and Singapore for the treatment of substance use disorder related to alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants (such as methamphetamine).
•reSET-O is authorized for use in combination with buprenorphine in the US for the treatment of opioid use disorder and was the first PDT to receive FDA Breakthrough Designation.
•Somryst is the only software-based FDA-authorized and guideline-recommended treatment for chronic insomnia and the first PDT submitted through FDA’s traditional 510(k) pathway while simultaneously being reviewed as part of FDA’s Software Precertification Pilot Program.
Our pipeline consists of 14 product candidates, including candidates in psychiatry, neurology, and outside of central nervous system therapeutic areas such as gastrointestinal (“GI”), oncology, and cardiovascular. We are initially focusing on psychiatric and neurologic conditions, which supports our strategy to commercialize our own products. 
All of Pear’s product candidate development is, at present, conducted in humans. As therapeutic candidates consisting of software, there are no in vivo animal or in vitro pre-clinical or non-clinical studies. This reduces the translational risk of going from animals to humans that is encountered by many biotechnology and typical pharmaceutical companies. 
The pipeline chart below uses four stages of development: Discovery, Proof of Concept (“POC”), Pivotal, and Commercial. Because PDTs are regulated as medical devices, these four stages align with guidance from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), which has two broad stages of clinical development before commercialization—pre-pivotal (such as feasibility, including first-in-human) and pivotal (generates definitive evidence of the safety and effectiveness for a specified intended use). Pear breaks down the pre-pivotal clinical development stage into Discovery and POC. 
Pre-commercial development at Pear is segregated into three stages: Discovery, POC, and Pivotal. Pear refers to the stage before clinical development as Discovery. Discovery is the concept stage, in which the product candidate, its mechanism(s) of action and target patient population(s) are defined, technical capabilities and prototypes are built, and then the candidate concept is rapidly tested in iterative evaluations. Some Discovery stage programs are focused on a specific indication, and others are focused on a disease area that may be refined based on further research. POC is the early clinical development stage, in which the product candidate is being tested in human clinical trials designed to prove that the candidate concept is worthy of advancement to the Pivotal stage. POC stage activities are related to technical work, study design, planning, other operational clinical trial activities, and statistical analysis. Pivotal is the registrational phase, in which the product candidate is tested in a randomized controlled trial designed to support market authorization from a regulatory authority such as FDA. Pivotal stage activities are related to technical work, study design, planning, other operational clinical trial activities, and/or statistical analysis that are part of a regulatory submission. Commercial stage includes any products which have received market authorization from FDA. 
Pear seeks out and licenses content suitable for the development of PDTs that has been initially developed by third parties. These parties, or content partners, are primarily academics or academic institutions, and Pear’s current partners are listed in the table below.

*Dartmouth transaction is with a researcher employed by Dartmouth. Pear has no direct contractual relationship with Dartmouth relating to this content.
**Karolinska transaction is with individual researchers who are employed by the Karolinska Institute. Pear has no direct contractual relationship with the Karolinska Institute relating to this content.
***Services agreement with Ironwood to evaluate a PDT in GI diseases.
As reflected above, Pear has licensed or otherwise acquired rights in content suitable for the development of PDTs from a variety of content partners. For further information concerning content collaborations see the section below entitled “License Agreements.”
Our agreement involving the University of Virginia relates to our license agreement with BeHealth Solutions, LLC and the relationship between Pear and University of Virginia Patent Foundation d/b/a University of Virginia Licensing & Ventures. 
Our license with Red 5 Group LLC relates to our content collaboration involving a researcher employed by Dartmouth College. 
Pear licenses certain content related to treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (“IBS”) developed by individual researchers employed by the Karolinska Institute who founded a company called Hedman-Lagerlöf Och Ljótsson Psykologi AB (“NCAB”) and assigned intellectual property rights in and to the IBS-related content to NCAB. Under Pear’s license agreement with NCAB, entered into on December 14, 2019, Pear was granted an exclusive license in the US and a non-exclusive license throughout the rest of the world to develop and commercialize digital therapeutic products incorporating NCAB’s IBS-related content, in exchange for an upfront payment in the mid-five figures, one-time milestone payments in low-six figures upon delivery to Pear of updated IBS-related content and upon first FDA approval of such a therapeutic product, and a royalty percentage in the low-single digits on net sales of such therapeutic products. 
Pear licenses contain content related to treatment of stress disorders from the University of Southern California (“USC”). Under the Technology License and Distribution Agreement entered into with USC on January 11, 2016, Pear was granted worldwide exclusive rights to develop drug/software combination products incorporating that 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 8


content to treat disorders, illness or trauma, in addition to certain worldwide non-exclusive rights. Pear initially paid USC an upfront fee in the low-five figures and agreed to pay a royalty percentage in the low-to-mid single digits on net sales of licensed products, an annual license fee (creditable against royalty payment obligations in the same year) increasing in amount from the low-six figures in 2018 to the low-seven figures in 2021, and regulatory and commercialization milestone payments that, in the aggregate, could reach a total in the low-seven figures. On February 11, 2019, Pear notified USC of its election no longer to pay the annual license fee, thus converting the exclusive license granted by USC to a non-exclusive license. 
Pear licenses certain contain related to treatment of mental health conditions including anxiety and depression from Instituto Auxologico Italiano (“IAI”). Under a software license agreement dated March 23, 2015, IAI granted Pear worldwide exclusive rights to develop drug/software combination products incorporating that content, in addition to certain worldwide non-exclusive rights. Pear agreed to pay IAI a royalty percentage in the low-to-mid single digits on net sales of licensed products, subject to an annual minimum revenue threshold in the low-six figures beginning in the fifth year of the license to maintain exclusivity; as this threshold was not met, Pear’s license from IAI is now non-exclusive. 
Pear licenses certain content related to treatment of migraine headaches from Children’s Hospital Medical Center, d/b/a Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (“CHMC”). Under a license agreement entered by the parties on December 17, 2019, CHMC granted a worldwide, non-exclusive license to Pear to develop and commercialize therapeutic products incorporating CHMC’s migraine-related content in exchange for an upfront payment in the mid-five figures and Pear’s agreement to pay CHMC one-time regulatory and commercial milestone payments that, in the aggregate, could reach a total in the mid-six figures, and a royalty percentage in low-single digits on net sales of such therapeutic products. 
Under a services agreement dated January 9, 2020 with Apricity Health, LLC (“Apricity”), a company engaged in the business of creating digital health therapeutic solutions for improving cancer treatment, Pear has a right of first offer to negotiate terms of a license with Apricity to develop and commercialize each of the first two commercial products developed by Apricity. 
Under a services agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ironwood”) dated October 25, 2019, Ironwood agreed to pay Pear a sum not to exceed the low-six figures to develop initial concepts for PDTs for treatment of gastrointestinal indications. 
Under an assignment agreement dated January 15, 2019, Pear acquired rights in certain assets primarily related to treatment of acute and chronic pain from Firsthand Technology, Inc. (“Firsthand”) (the “Firsthand Agreement”). In exchange for acquiring those assets, Legacy Pear issued Legacy Pear Common Shares to Firsthand, agreed to pay an amount capped in the low-six figures to certain creditors of Firsthand, and agreed to pay a one-time milestone payment in the mid-six figures to Firsthand upon first commercial sale of an FDA-cleared Product (as defined in the Firsthand Agreement) and to pay a royalty percentage in the low-single digits on net sales of such Products. Other than the agreements with ISF, Red 5 and BeHealth, Pear does not consider any of the foregoing agreements to be material for purposes of Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K. 
Pear’s PDTs and its product candidates achieve their therapeutic potential by delivering evidence-based mechanisms-of-action, such as standard behavioral treatments. For example, reSET delivers an addiction-specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy called Community Reinforcement Approach (“CRA”), fluency training, and contingency management (“CM”). Somryst delivers a disease-specific intervention called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (“CBTi”), which is also the first-line treatment recommended for patients with chronic insomnia in the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s clinical guidelines for patients with chronic insomnia. Across Pear’s pipeline, the product candidates each deliver various forms of standardized and disease-specific behavioral treatments such cognitive behavioral therapy (“CBT”), behavioral activation (“BA”), exposure therapy, and/or cognitive restructuring. Product candidates that are intended to treat diseases with standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, such as schizophrenia, for example, would make recommendations on medication usage to support overall care. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 9


Pear’s products and product candidates may be studied both in trials sponsored and conducted by Pear and trials that are conducted by non-Pear researchers in collaborative and investigator-initiated trials. Pear is currently enrolling patients in a study that it is sponsoring and conducting on its own involving gamification of reSET-O, which is an outpatient-based, randomized-controlled, open-label study conducted at two addiction treatment programs of a gamified-version of reSET-O. This trial is partially supported by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The study objectives are (i) to evaluate participant engagement data [Time Frame: From Week 1 to Week 8 (End of Treatment)], and (ii) to evaluate the number of active sessions per week between PEAR-008 (gamified version) and reSET-O.
Pear temporarily paused patient enrollment in its DREAM trial at the end of 2021 to make improvements to its development platform in order to gather additional follow up data. Pear received approval for their institutional review board protocol amendment on February 2, 2022, and will began to re-enroll patients (with an enrollment goal of 1,500 patients) in DREAM, which is an open-label, 9-week treatment, de-centralized trial to collect real-world evidence for Somryst. The study objectives are (i) to measure the change in the Insomnia Severity Index (“ISI”) [Time Frame: From baseline to Day 63 (End of Treatment) and Days 243, 428, 610, and 793 (Follow-up)], and (ii) to measure the change in the ISI total score from baseline to end of treatment and follow-up. The ISI’s total score ranges from 0 (not clinically significant) to 28 (clinically significant).
Key Elements of Our Growth Strategy 
Our mission is to use software to treat disease directly and increase access to care for patients, including underserved constituents of the healthcare ecosystem. We plan to accomplish this goal by developing, licensing, and acquiring PDTs, and building the preferred PDT commercialization platform for use by prescribing clinicians. We aim to be the one-stop shop for PDTs offered both by Pear and by other organizations that may choose to host their products on our commercial platform. To achieve our mission, we are pursuing the following strategies: 
•Capitalize on our leadership position in the PDT market. By obtaining FDA market authorization for the first three PDTs, we established ourselves as the leader and pioneer of a new category. We currently have 14 additional product candidates in our pipeline, and we intend to capitalize on our leadership position via horizontal scale. 
•Continue to invest in our efforts to create the primary commercial platform through which patients and clinicians access PDTs. We are pioneering new commercialization approaches for PDTs. We seek to capture the best of tech and life science approaches to create a scalable and capital-efficient model across our existing portfolio and downstream pipeline. To date, our sales, marketing, and medical affairs teams have engaged with more than 690 clinicians who have written prescriptions for one or more of our three FDA-authorized products. We expect that number will grow proportionally in response to increasing traction with payors and growth in the number of commercially available PDTs. In addition, we recently began piloting direct-to-patient engagement via our virtual care platform, which allows patients to obtain a prescription without going to a clinician’s office. 
•Establish reimbursement pathways. To date, we have 30 organizations across over 31.7 million individuals with healthcare coverage providing access to our three FDA-authorized products via listing on formulary, as a covered benefit, bulk purchase, or funding a study. Pear’s payor strategy focuses across all major payor channels, including employers, Integrated Delivery Networks (“IDNs”), pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), commercial payors, and government payors including Medicaid and Medicare. 
•Opportunistically license and acquire PDT product candidates and host third-party PDT products. We aspire to host products from other PDT companies on our multi-product Pear MD™ Clinician Dashboards and technology infrastructure. This has the potential to create a PDT marketplace for all patients to access safe, effective, and secure digital therapeutics. We believe we will be the acquirer and licensing partner of choice for other PDT companies and academia. Our development platform is designed to bring product candidates through development, and our commercialization platform could afford long-term commercial success. We will continue to opportunistically pursue acquisitions and licensing opportunities to grow our developmental pipeline. Pear’s experience developing and guiding PDTs through the regulatory review 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 10


process, as well as our scalable platform, provide a foundation on which Pear could potentially develop and host more than a hundred additional PDTs. 
•Protect our intellectual property. In addition to securing regulatory authorization for our PDTs, we make strategic use of various intellectual property regimes: patents; copyrights; trademarks; and trade secrets. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. 
•Expand outside the United States. Today, we operate only in the US. At this point, we intend to expand our capabilities to support ex-US partners who would commercialize specific products in specific regions. We plan on evaluating potential partners on a geography-by-geography basis and will pursue partnerships to maximize the value of our company. 
Industry Trends Overview 
Pear believes that major trends are converging to create a significant opportunity to treat disease with software, either alone or in combination with drugs, due to the following factors: 
•The ongoing burden of chronic disease. Ninety percent of the $3.8 trillion in US annual healthcare expenditures are for people with chronic and mental health conditions. 
•There is a pronounced shortage of clinicians. Across many disease areas there are tens of millions of patients with only a few thousand trained specialists who can provide treatment. 
•There is a rapid patient and clinician adoption of digital for healthcare delivery such as telemedicine. The number of people who have used telehealth has doubled from 40% prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to 80% post-quarantine. 
•There is pervasive use of technology. Americans spend an average of 5.4 hours per day on their mobile phones. Connection to a therapeutic delivered digitally is convenient and available for most Americans. The data captured by this engagement could also drive deeper insights into disease states and the ability to personalize treatment. 
We believe the trends described above have created a moment in time when technology-based approaches are essential to, and capable of, revolutionizing healthcare. We believe that these trends have accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in fewer in-person visits and increased the adoption and use of technology and digital health experiences across consumers, clinicians, payors, and the broader healthcare system. 
Our PDT Solution and Value Proposition 
PDTs are prescribed by clinicians, downloaded by the patient to a smart phone, tablet, or VR headset, and used under the supervision of a prescribing clinician. PDTs have a recommended frequency and duration of use, but patients can use the product whenever they want and wherever they are. PDTs receive market authorization from regulators, like FDA, with a label that addresses both safety and effectiveness. To obtain a label from FDA, PDT companies developing novel therapies are generally required to submit data from one or more randomized, controlled trials (“RCT”) that demonstrate safety and effectiveness, and product candidates must be developed in a good manufacturing practice (“GMP”)-compliant environment. 
In order for a patient to obtain a prescription, there is first an appropriate assessment and diagnosis of the patient, which is then followed by direction and ongoing guidance, as well as accountability related to product use and ongoing care management. Engagement levels for Pear’s PDTs significantly exceed that of published rates of health and wellness digital products. For patients with disease, a prescription is an enabler of access, engagement, and real-world effectiveness. PDTs integrate into existing healthcare infrastructure allowing for a digital experience via a patient’s own clinician, enhancing the continuum of care rather than fragmenting care paradigms. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 11


We believe that PDTs will become an important segment of the digital health revolution and a vital part of the medical armamentarium because they have qualities that are similar to those of both health and wellness apps and pharmaceuticals. PDTs leverage the pervasiveness and accessibility of digital technology to improve human health. However, PDTs are always developed in a GMP-compliant environment, maintain compliance with data security and HIPAA protocols, and integrate into standard of care. PDTs are also tested in RCTs and are FDA-authorized as safe and effective therapies for particular indications like pharmaceuticals but also enable clinicians to receive timely feedback regarding patient progress and therapy adherence. This patient monitoring capability afforded by PDTs may be the difference in a patient’s success during a course of treatment. The table below shows some of the key differences between PDTs and other products. 
Pear reimagined what treating disease could look like from the vantage point of patients, clinicians, and payors. We set out to disrupt the healthcare system with urgency because we believe there is a growing need for the treatments that can be provided by PDTs. With our proprietary development and commercialization platform, we can bring product candidates to FDA for market authorization, and we can bring FDA-authorized products to patients, clinicians, and payors. We continue to refine and optimize our development capabilities, and we believe we will be able to scale our operations significantly in the near-term, allowing us to pursue authorizations for more product candidates, to self-commercialize our products inside the US and commercialize our products outside of the US with the help of regional partners. 
Pear is a platform-based, product-driven company. Our end-to-end PDT engine, which currently includes three FDA-authorized products and a pipeline of 14 product candidates, continues to produce clinical and real-world data as well as health economic outcome research (“HEOR”) data that provide evidence of Pear’s ability to enhance outcomes, increase access and reduce healthcare costs, and validate Pear’s value proposition. We believe our value proposition will magnify over time, as our model scales and we expand the reach and impact of PDTs. 
We believe PDTs are poised to disrupt healthcare delivery in ways that could offer benefits to three major stakeholders: 
1.Patients: PDTs provide 24/7 remote treatment access to patients that can improve outcomes and be used alongside other standard of care treatments. Additionally, PDTs have a relatively benign side effect profile compared to traditional pharmaceutical therapies. 
2.Clinicians: PDTs provide additional treatment options and improve clinicians’ reach to patients, potentially resulting in broader patient impact. They are integrated into standard practice and may also be used alongside traditional drug-based treatments. Data from the PDT provides insight to the clinician and the clinical care team which can facilitate enhanced care navigation and delivery. They also provide reimbursable events for interactions on the “Pear MD Clinician Dashboard,” an end-to-end patient service center. 
3.Payors: PDTs have the potential to reduce overall healthcare costs to payors by providing patients with therapies that may be more cost-effective. Additionally, PDTs may fill gaps in care across indications with high prevalence. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 12


For Patients 
PDTs have the potential to be safe, effective, and accessible care options for patients with diseases and mental health disorders. These options are increasingly needed as diseases and mental health disorders require more innovative approaches to overcome current treatment challenges and realize better patient outcomes. With Pear’s PDTs, patients have 24/7 remote access to their treatment program and to clinicians who can monitor progress to inform their treatment approach, regardless of physical proximity. They can be integrated into standard of care and may be used alongside pharmacotherapy. Pear’s software is designed to be easy-to-use and intuitive, and it also generates data from patient usage to inform the treatment approach for each patient. Our clinical trial and real-world data also continue to demonstrate a favorable side-effect profile versus existing medications, which could foster stronger adherence to treatment programs. 
The privacy provided by reSET and reSET-O, for example, offers access to treatment of addiction without fear of stigma. Patients also gain control over where they conduct addiction treatment and can conduct clinician check-ins remotely, which empower patients to better navigate their care. Further, we believe that our software enables a larger portion of Americans access to addiction treatment. Only a small fraction of patients with addiction are actively enrolled in treatment today, and we believe that reSET and reSET-O may significantly lower treatment barriers to ongoing care and substantially increase the ability of clinicians to serve more and diverse patient needs. An analogous shift is seen in Somyrst, Pear’s treatment for chronic insomnia. Clinical guidelines indicate Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (“CBTi”) as the first-line treatment, but there are currently fewer than 300 certified and licensed CBTi clinicians in the US to treat a patient population of approximately 30 million. We believe that Somyrst as a therapeutic may substantially change the access paradigm, creating an ability for patients to get the treatment they need when they need it most. 
For Clinicians 
PDTs provide a new treatment option that clinicians can provide to their patients. Many clinicians today lack evidence-based treatment options with the potential to improve outcomes. PDTs are a standardized, evidence-based, cost-effective, and easily accessed class of treatments that can be used as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with pharmacotherapies. Not only can PDTs better enable clinicians to serve their patients, but PDTs can also improve the reach of clinicians, creating the potential for broader patient impact. 
In addition, we believe Pear’s products enable richer and more effective patient data and engagement capabilities. For clinicians prescribing reSET, reSET-O, or Somryst, clinicians may use our Pear MD Clinician Dashboard and review a wealth of data-based, real-time feedback that can help them better understand and manage their patients’ treatment journey. The Pear MD Clinical Dashboard is easy to use and accessible 24/7, enabling care teams to conveniently manage populations of patients. This real-time engagement is particularly impactful in the world of addiction, in which adherence is continually decided, moment to moment, outside of the walls of the clinician’s office. The ability of a clinician to regularly monitor and engage with their patient can make the difference in successful navigation of the treatment journey. 
Pear’s platform can also create reimbursable events for Pear MD Clinician Dashboard interactions. 
For Payors 
We believe Pear’s PDTs will reduce overall medical costs, support value-based care initiatives, and improve member experience. Insights and information collected by Pear’s PDTs can be integrated within care management workflows to provide payors with valuable insights that support population health management and value-based care initiatives. Pear’s PDTs can also fill gaps in specialty care across large populations, providing timely insights into patient engagement and practice performance via a dedicated platform. 
A study of 351 patients evaluating healthcare resource utilization via insurance claims six months after reSET-O initiation found that compared to a six-month baseline there was a 62% reduction in inpatient hospitalizations and a 20% reduction in emergency room visits, resulting in a near-term cost-savings of $2,150 per patient. The durability of reSET-O’s treatment effect at 9 months was evaluated in a larger group of patients and was communicated in publications. One of those publication compared outcomes between reSET-O patients and 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 13


controls and found that reSET-O-treated patients experienced costs that were $2,708 lower than for controls, and which were also driven by a reduction in hospital-related utilization. 
In addition, on May 19, 2021, Pear presented results of two analyses demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of reSET-O at the virtual annual meeting of The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research. The machine learning analysis showed that all clusters of engagement (low, medium, and high) each experienced a very similar reduction in emergency department and inpatient stays of approximately 60%. The budget impact analysis showed that reSET-O plus treatment-as-usual (“TAU”) (i.e., transmucosal buprenorphine, face-to-face counseling and contingency management) versus TAU alone resulted in a projected net cost reduction over a five-year period. Supporting this budget impact analysis are two subsequent publications examining the cost effectiveness and cost utility of reSET-O, both showing quality adjusted life year gains from increased retention and abstinence, respectively, which were accompanied by reductions in overall costs, supporting the economic advantages of reSET-O vs. TAU.
We believe that the real-world claims analysis and health economic modeling data, together with existing RCT effectiveness data, demonstrate that reSET-O can provide compelling clinical and economic cost-savings to payors seeking a high level of care for their members. 
Our Scalable Commercial Platform 
Pear’s commercial platform was designed to be agile and scalable with the ability to host multiple PDTs developed by Pear and potentially by third parties. We believe that the investments that we are making in our development engine, commercialization strategy, clinician and patient awareness, and HEOR data will enable our platform to become the industry standard. We also believe that this will be an advantage not only to Pear, but also to our third-party developers that can potentially host their PDTs on Pear’s commercial platform. Through this replicable process, Pear expects to further boost its industry-leading position as the primary provider of PDTs. 
With this potential ability to host third-party PDTs on its platform, Pear is positioning itself not only as a leading PDT developer, but also as a centralized marketplace for patients seeking PDTs, which is a key value proposition and brand definer for Pear. 
Our Advantages 
•Pear is pioneering the PDT industry. Pear is the first mover in the PDT industry, and as a result has advanced experience in developing and commercializing PDTs. Pear was the first company to receive FDA authorization for a PDT and the term PDT was conceived and defined during that initial authorization process. Pear currently has the greatest number of FDA-authorized PDTs and has been developing PDTs since 2013. 
•Pear leverages our data aggregation capabilities. Pear’s ability to collect data from existing PDTs, generate insights and improvements based on these data, and then quickly develop new PDTs using these insights has enabled us to bring to market the first three FDA-authorized PDTs. We believe it will enable us to continue to bring additional FDA-authorized PDTs to market across a breadth of indications. 
•Pear developed a reproducible process for cost-effective development and regulatory review of PDTs. We conduct agile software development in a GMP-compliant environment. Due to our remote clinical trial infrastructure, we are able to conduct clinical trials without the need for external sites and develop our products iteratively, which both accelerates timelines and reduces costs. This iterative product development paradigm contrasts with traditional drug development in which a molecule that enters the clinic cannot be improved or adapted along the way. 
•Pear utilizes a relatively lean and efficient salesforce to target customers at the enterprise level. Our commercialization model is built on the intersection of biotech, tech, and medical device commercialization methods. We take an enterprise-level, key-account management approach to pursuing IDNs, health systems, academic teaching hospitals, and large addiction clinics and systems. This is a capital-efficient and scalable model that allows for accelerated growth. As we secure additional 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 14


reimbursement contracts with payors, we will seek to accelerate revenue growth through increased investment in sales and marketing. Pear currently promotes reSET and reSET-O using a small specialty salesforce and targeted marketing budget. Despite our lean salesforce and budget, our commercialization efforts have resulted in over 700 clinicians across 32 states who have prescribed reSET and reSET-O over 20,000 times since launch. Pear currently boasts patient and prescriber satisfaction scores of 89% and 82%, respectively, which validates our approach. The results achieved by reSET and reSET-O provide Pear with a strong foundation to achieve scalable and sustainable sales over time. Pear currently promotes Somryst via a direct-to-consumer pilot that launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
•Pear is building a robust IP portfolio. Pear regularly applies for patents, copyrights, and trademarks throughout the development and iteration of its products, and also judiciously maintains trade secrets. Pear protects the iterations of its proprietary technology that are commercially important to its business by filing, maintaining, and, if necessary, defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on copyright, including registrations for product source code, graphic user interfaces and other content, as well as on trademarks. Finally, Pear maintains trade secrets relating to its proprietary PDT product development platform to enable Pear to strengthen its leadership position in the PDT industry over the long-term. 
•Pear has a diverse and scalable management team that is pioneering the PDT space. The discovery, development, and commercialization of PDTs as a new healthcare delivery system requires both a breadth and depth of experience. Our cross-disciplinary and cross-functional team of experts collectively synthesizes years of experience in medicine, biotech, technology, and data science. This breadth and depth of experience has enabled Pear to forge new pathways within the healthcare industry. 
Our Commercialization Strategy 
With three FDA-authorized products on the market, and a deep and broad pipeline of product candidates, Pear is currently at a commercial inflection point. Additionally, the PDT category continues to expand with three other companies recently receiving marketing authorization. There is strong momentum in the industry, and we believe our commercialization platform has the potential to set us up as the one-stop shop for PDTs. 
We are pioneering PDT commercialization 
By developing PDTs as a new class of medicines, Pear pioneers innovative approaches for its commercialization. Pear’s commercialization strategy attempts to combine the most effective features of the commercialization methodologies of both tech and life sciences companies to create a scalable yet capital-efficient PDT commercialization model. 
Pear deploys two distinct commercialization models. First, to capture the most effective features of traditional life sciences commercialization methodologies, Pear utilizes a conventional sales-enabled approach focused on targeting large, multi-specialty health systems. Second, to capture the most effective features of traditional tech commercialization methodologies, Pear utilizes a virtual care platform to directly engage with clinicians and patients. 
Pear’s platform enables the collection of data characterizing patient engagement and progress during treatment with PDTs. This data collection capability appeals to clinicians and payors who seek to track treatment progress. Pear’s centralized PDT platform is configured to provide robust data that describes patient treatment progress to clinicians and payors, thereby providing these stakeholders with insights that have the potential to improve clinical outcomes and lower costs. Clinicians can use the insights provided by Pear’s platform to enable the clinician to support a patient’s course of treatment outside of routine office visits, and during periods when the patient may be experiencing increased challenges with treatment adherence. Similarly, payors can use the data provided by Pear’s platform to supplement their understanding of population-level treatment outcomes, and to adjust access to PDTs accordingly. As a result, Pear’s PDT platform serves as an enterprise sales tool for stakeholders looking to monitor and improve the clinical outcomes of patients through data collection and analysis.

We are building patient, clinician, and payor awareness 
As the pioneer in PDTs, Pear is built to educate all participants of care delivery, including patients, clinicians and payors, about a new class of medicines. To inform and educate the public about PDTs, Pear has built and deployed sales, marketing, patient and clinician services, and medical affairs teams. These PDT specialists are dedicated to educating patients, clinicians, payors, and other stakeholders about PDTs. 
As a result of the efforts of our PDT specialists, PDTs are increasingly recognized as a treatment option by the medical community as evidenced by the increasing number of clinicians prescribing PDTs and the increasing number of PDT prescriptions being written. To date, Pear has educated more than 690 clinicians that have collectively written prescriptions for one or more of Pear’s three FDA-authorized products, and we expect that number will grow significantly over time. Once introduced to PDTs, those clinicians are equipped to provide valuable education and guidance to patients and other clinicians regarding how the use of PDTs. 
We are creating access to PDTs by establishing reimbursement pathways 
The Pear team is actively working to establish reimbursement pathways for PDTs, and we believe that as a result of these efforts, payors are increasingly providing their members with access to PDTs. To date, Pear has 30 payors across more than 31.7 million covered lives that provide access to its PDTs. reSET and reSET-O are currently covered as pharmacy benefits, medical benefits, and/or via direct purchase transactions. In an effort to onboard additional payors, Pear engages directly with payors to establish coding, coverage, and payment pathways for its PDTs and the PDT category as a whole. Pear is also exploring innovative contracting models with payors that utilize the strong correlation between patient engagement with PDTs and the resulting clinical and economic benefits. We believe that these continued payor engagement efforts will result in reimbursement for PDTs by both commercial and public payors in the US, including, but not limited to, self-insured employers, PBMs, health plans, IDNs, and public payors, including Medicaid and Medicare. 
In addition to pursuing traditional payor reimbursement of PDTs, Pear also offers a PEAR Assistance Program (“PAP”) to ensure that eligible, underserved patients living with SUD or OUD have access to reSET and reSET-O. PAP is designed for SUD or OUD patients who are being treated by a licensed US clinician on an outpatient basis and have been prescribed a PDT. PAP-qualifying patients have limited or no health insurance coverage, a demonstrated qualifying financial need, and live within the US. Patients enrolled in PAP generate additional real world and HEOR data that may be used to support the utilization and coverage of Pear’s products. 
We are building end-to-end infrastructure that provides ease of use to clinicians 
To enable a high degree of accessibility to PDTs for clinicians, Pear has developed and deployed a patient service platform, called PearConnect™, designed to be a convenient one-stop shop for PDTs. PearConnect features four distinct system components, consisting of PDTs for patient use, the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard, an end-to-end patient service center, and a data analytics system configured to aggregate patient engagement, adherence, and clinical outcome data for insight generation. These components of PearConnect are intentionally designed to improve accessibility to Pear’s PDTs. PearConnect also incorporates various data privacy and security features to support the protection, quality, and integrity of each component of our platform, including the data that is processed and stored by the platform. Each component plays a meaningful role in ongoing and product evolution and performance, building Pear’s PDT marketplace, and enabling clinicians and payors to assess the value of each PDT on a population and individual level. 
The Pear MD Clinician Dashboard displays icons representing multiple different PDTs to a viewing clinician. Via the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard, clinicians are able to learn about the PDTs offered and are able to gain valuable, timely insights into their patients’ progress over the course of a PDT prescription through the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard based on engagement, adherence, and clinical outcome data gathered and analyzed by the analytics component of the platform. If clinicians and payors deem initial PDT prescriptions a success as supported by this collected and displayed health economic data, we can easily add any new PDT products to existing agreements with clinicians and to the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 16


Pear’s end-to-end patient service center provides support to patients that have been prescribed PDTs, which includes informational and technical support regarding use of the PDT and the virtual care platform. The service makes it easier for clinicians to introduce new patients to PDTs and to Pear’s platform. 
The data analytics component of PearConnect collects patient engagement, adherence, and clinical outcome data, and generates insights based on this data. The insights generated by the data analytics component of PearConnect can be accessed by clinicians via the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard to inform clinicians of their patients’ progress over the course of a PDT prescription. The insights generated by the data analytics can also be used by us to incrementally evolve individual PDTs to better serve patients, and we believe will ultimately generate improved clinical outcomes. 
We are able to demonstrate the value of our PDTs with HEOR data generated based on commercial patients 
Pear’s commercial infrastructure allows for the analysis of patients’ healthcare claims data pre-, during, and post-use of Pear’s PDTs. Based on these robust analytics, Pear is able to gain insight into PDT utilization across patient groups, and to understand how use of its PDTs correlates with clinical outcomes. Data-derived insights support collaboration with clinicians, coverage and reimbursement by payors, and product enhancements. 
Discovery Strategy and Development Platform 
Developing an entirely new class of medicines led to Pear pioneering new approaches for the discovery and development of PDTs. We have invested in and created a model to progress from concept to market authorization, and we believe we have optimized that model to the point where it is now ready to scale. 
Pear is pioneering clinical development. Our three approaches consist of: (i) an integrated virtual and decentralized clinical study platform, (ii) agile development as therapeutic candidates move through phases, and (iii) integrated health economic and real-world extension studies to facilitate regular and timely evidence generation. 
First, Pear has designed and built its own integrated virtual and decentralized study platform. This technology facilitates a seamless experience for fully virtual and decentralized studies. DREAM, Pear’s remote, real-world clinical study of Somryst is the first to utilize this platform, with recruitment, enrollment, consents, monitoring, and assessments all completed through digital and virtual means. Patients do not need to be present at a clinic or site for any step of the process. In addition to being more cost-effective, the speed of recruitment and enrollment is enhanced by facilitating fully automated screening and consenting, and by minimizing the number of patients requiring manual or direct human interaction. 
Second, as Pear’s therapeutic candidates move from discovery and through subsequent stages of development, Pear iterates the product. If data indicate that adding additional modalities or mechanisms of action to the candidate is warranted, Pear is able to refine the PDT in between subsequent studies and re-evaluate the candidate in a variety of clinical study designs. We believe deploying this agile and adaptable framework to clinical development has the potential to increase not only speed but also the probability of success. 
Third, as Pear conducts pre-market studies, health economic endpoints are integrated and real-world extension studies are built into development plans. Registrational and even earlier stage development studies having health economic or insurance claims endpoints have the potential to facilitate earlier insights to support payor engagement. Post-randomized studies and even post-market, Pear continues to generate clinical and economic data on every patient that uses a PDT whether it is a Pear PDT or a third-party PDT using the Pear platform. Adaptive real-world extension studies post-registration demonstrate generalizability from RCTs, and have the ability to demonstrate that RCT outcomes are consistent in real-world use and across various clinical settings and patient populations. 
Our Commercial Products 
reSET 
reSET is the first PDT to receive FDA market authorization and is authorized in the US and Singapore for the treatment of SUD in patients who are 18 years of age and older. reSET is the only FDA-authorized product 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 17


indicated to treat addiction to alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants (such as methamphetamines) as no pharmacotherapy or other FDA-approved treatments for this patient population exist. reSET is a 12-week prescription-only treatment for patients who are actively enrolled in outpatient therapy under the supervision of a clinician. 
Disease Overview 
Addiction is a disease of the brain that manifests as compulsive substance use, known as SUD. In the US, the disease of addiction can be characterized as an epidemic, with more than 20 million Americans struggling with addiction based on 2019 data. 
Each year, there are approximately 13,000 overdose deaths related to stimulant use, particularly methamphetamine, and approximately 16,000 deaths related to cocaine use. Since the 1970s, there has been a significant increase in mortality related to unintentional drug poisonings, growing at 7% per year. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated these trends. In 2020, there was an 18% increase in drug related overdose deaths and a 26% increase in overdoses involving cocaine. 
Traditional medical guidelines recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (“CBT”) and contingency management (“CM”) as best practices in treating SUD. However, there are multiple roadblocks that prevent a majority of SUD patients from ultimately receiving effective behavioral treatment, such as CBT and CM. CBT is largely conducted in outpatient settings, and is a time-intensive, location-dependent treatment methodology. This and the sheer quantity of SUD patients results in an insufficient number of trained therapists and facilities to meet demand. This results in SUD patients often receiving inconsistent treatment in inconvenient locations. Insufficient access to CBT can cause patients to drop out of therapy or not pursue therapy in the first place. Even when SUD patients are able to gain sufficient access to CBT, clinician education, training, and treatment paradigms vary. Documented discrepancies in CBT administration standards and protocols impede the ability of CBT to adequately and uniformly treat the wide range and quantity of SUD patients that require care. Furthermore, many patients may experience perceived or real stigma associated with physical attendance at CBT sessions. As a result of these many obstacles, only a fraction of SUD patients receive CBT treatment. For instance, in 2019, only 1.5% of SUD patients received formal treatment. 
In addition to the challenges to initiating and completing a first round of SUD treatment, for many patients, addiction can be a lifelong battle that often involves multiple relapses. This constant and recurring need for treatment places additional burdens on SUD patients, particularly given the currently insufficient treatment options available. There remains a significant unmet need for accessible and effective SUD treatment options. 
Our Solution 
To bridge this gap between disease prevalence and treatment availability, Pear has an FDA-authorized PDT that has been clinically proven to help treat addiction and extend the reach of clinicians to patients during their recovery journey. reSET is authorized for the treatment of SUD in patients 18 years or older. reSET’s mechanism of action combines addiction-specific CBT, fluency training, contingency management, and craving and trigger assessment, all provided by Pear’s software-based application. It is intended to reduce substance abuse during treatment, eventually supporting discontinuance and recovery while simultaneously improving retention rates in the outpatient treatment program. 
To begin treatment, the clinician prescribes the patient the PDT. The patient then downloads the software to a smart phone, tablet or VR headset, inputs their prescription access code and gets access to the PDT. The PDT includes three evidence-based treatments, each of which represent a distinct mechanism of action: 
•The first is an addiction-specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy, called a community reinforcement approach (“CRA”), that moves patients from actively using a substance to reducing and ultimately discontinuing use. CRA is a form of treatment that integrates cognition and learning with treatment techniques. CRA is based on the insight that cognitive, emotional, and behavioral variables are functionally interrelated. Treatment is aimed at identifying and modifying the patient’s maladaptive thought processes and problematic behaviors through cognitive restructuring and behavioral techniques 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 18


to achieve change. Disease-specific CRA targets the associated neurocircuitry for addiction, harnessing adaptive neuroplasticity. reSET is comprised of 61 interactive modules (31 core and 30 supplement modules). Core modules focus on key CRA concepts to build skills to support behavior change and prevent relapse. Supplemental modules provide more in-depth information on specific topics such as relationship skills and living with a disease. 
•The second is fluency training, which assesses proficiency and reinforces concept mastery. Fluency training supports the ability of the patient to apply their learnings in moments of stress to facilitate their treatment and ultimate recovery.
•The third is contingency management, which is a positive reinforcement mechanism. CM induces a dopamine response directly competing with the negative response induced by substance use. It does this by rewarding healthy behaviors and key outcomes such as engagement in treatment and reduced substance use through a clinical algorithm.
CRA and fluency training strengthen affected neurocircuitry while CM induces dopamine in the nucleus accumbens repairing dysfunctional neurophysiology, driving engagement with CRA and treatment in a virtuous cycle. These integrated mechanisms of action drive patient engagement and target the pathophysiology of addiction to correct and restore neurofunction. 
reSET also includes validated assessments including substance use, triggers, and cravings supporting interactive engagement and insights to the clinical care team. All of this information is shared with the clinical care team via the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard enabling the clinician and care team to derive insights to inform optimal patient care. 
By integrating PDTs into the practice of medicine, the clinician and patient relationship may be strengthened, and data insights facilitate clinician extension for greater efficiency and effectiveness. reSET and reSET-O provide 24/7 anytime, anywhere treatment. As the patient undergoes therapy with reSET, the patient and clinician can continue to meet in person or virtually as part of their outgoing treatment therapy, and the clinician has easy access via the 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 19


Pear MD Clinician Dashboard to monitor and adjust treatment. We believe the connectivity established through our PDTs is valuable to patients and clinicians. 
Our Clinical Trial Data 
Among patients with SUD (i.e. addiction to cocaine, cannabis, stimulants, and/or alcohol), RCT data demonstrated that adding the PDT to TAU more than doubled abstinence rates during the last month of the 12-week trial. Among all patients, adding a PDT to outpatient care improved retention rate compared to TAU (72.2% vs 63.5%) at the end of the 12-week trial. Treatment with the PDT did not demonstrate a significant difference in unanticipated adverse events compared to TAU. 
Adult men and women (N=399) entering 10 outpatient addiction treatment programs were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of either TAU (N=193) or reduced treatment-as-usual (“rTAU”) plus the PDT, with the intervention substituting for about two hours of standard care per week (N=206). 
TAU consisted of individual and group counseling at the participating programs for 4-6 hours per week. rTAU consisted of 2 hours less than TAU of aggregate individual and group counseling. The primary outcome measures were abstinence from drugs and heavy drinking (measured by twice-weekly urine drug screens and self-report) and time to dropout from treatment. 
Those in the PDT+rTAU group had a higher retention rate of 76.2% compared to 63.2% in TAU and a greater abstinence rate in the last 4 weeks of 40.3% in the PDT+rTAU group relative to 17.6% in the TAU group. This effect was more pronounced among patients who had a positive urine drug or breath alcohol screen at study entry (N=192) with an abstinence rate in the last 4 weeks in the PDT+rTAU group of 16.1% compared to 3.2% of TAU.

Adverse events evaluated were typical of patients with SUD, including cardiovascular disease, GI events, depression, mania, suicidal behavior, suicidal thoughts and attempts. None of the adverse events in the interventional arm were adjudicated by the study investigators to be related to the PDT. 
This RCT was reviewed by FDA and supported Pear’s FDA market authorization of reSET to treat patients with SUD to improve clinical outcomes. 
Real World Evidence and Health Economic and Outcomes Research Data 
Pear intends to publish reSET Real World Evidence (“RWE”) and HEOR data starting with a six-month duration. 
reSET-O 
reSET-O is the second PDT to receive FDA authorization and the first to receive breakthrough designation in the US for the treatment of OUD in patients who are 18 years of age and older. reSET-O is a 12-week prescription-only treatment that is intended to increase retention of patients with OUD in outpatient treatment by providing CBT as an adjunct to outpatient treatment that includes transmucosal buprenorphine and CM. reSET-O is indicated only for patients who are currently under the supervision of a clinician. 
Disease Overview 
Opioid use disorder in the US has increased so dramatically and taken such a heavy toll on American lives over the past decade that, in 2017, the US Department of Human Health Services declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency. Approximately 1.6 million Americans suffer from OUD annually in the US, and according to the CDC, the substance use and opioid use disorder epidemics continue to grow with unprecedented numbers of fatal opioid overdoses, in excess of 200 deaths daily (over 75,000 annually), approximately 87% of which are due to widely available, inexpensive yet pharmacologically-potent synthetic opioids. Nonfatal overdoses far outnumber fatal overdoses and place a tremendous burden the health care system through excess utilization of acute care services such as emergency department and inpatient stays, which contributes to rising health care costs. For example, every year, there are over 500,000 emergency room visits for opioid overdoses in the US. Of those patients that are discharged from the emergency room following overdose, 24% are readmitted to the emergency room for additional emergency care within 30 days. As a result of these frequent emergency room visits, opioid overdoses are estimated to cost the US $11.0 billion in hospital costs alone. A recent study evaluated the direct healthcare cost of 2,044,467 people with OUD to be $89.1 billion with an average cost of $43,581 per patient per year. The cost of the current opioid crisis in the US is estimated to exceed $700.0 billion.
Treatment has been shown to help patients avoid the increased risk of respiratory arrest, organ system damage, and dramatically reduce use of acute care services and associated high costs. However, only 11.2% of patients in the US receive treatment with MOUD in a given year. For those who obtain treatment, dropout rates are high, ranging between 30% and 50% at 90 days, highlighting the need for comprehensive support to keep patients engaged in their recovery. Progress in recovery helps reduce the burden on the health care system, and helps to mitigate the harm the opioid crisis causes. 
The current standard of care for treating opioid addiction is medication-assisted treatment (“MAT”). MAT consists of the administration of medication, such as buprenorphine, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapy. Only a fraction of opioid-addicted patients, however, receive treatment. Similar to SUD patients, there are significant barriers to opioid-addicted patients receiving accessible and effective care. Many patients fail to receive care as a result of care inaccessibility, cost, or patient stigmatization. It is estimated that only 19% of opioid-addicted patients receive treatment each year. In addition, many opioid-addicted patients elect to rely solely on 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 21


medication and reject counseling. For example, only 10% of opioid-addicted patients that are prescribed buprenorphine receive adjunct psychotherapy treatment. While reliance solely on the medication portion of the recommended treatment paradigm may provide a higher level of convenience for patients, adherence to only a portion of treatment decreases overall probability of success. Therefore, due to the current lack of effective treatment options for OUD, and the continually growing number of patients, there remains a significant unmet need in the fight against OUD. 
Our Solution 
To bridge this gap between disease prevalence and treatment, Pear has an FDA-authorized PDT that has been clinically proven to treat OUD and extend the reach of clinicians to patients during their recovery journey. reSET-O is authorized for use in combination with buprenorphine in the US for the treatment of OUD in patients who are 18 years or older. 
Similar to reSET, reSET-O is intended to increase retention of patients with OUD in outpatient treatment by providing the same behavioral treatments. This PDT is a 12-week treatment used as an adjunct to outpatient treatment, including transmucosal buprenorphine and CM. Patients using reSET-O are required to be under the supervision of a clinician. 
reSET-O has three mechanisms of action consisting of addiction-specific CRA, fluency training, and CM. reSET-O has an additional function that supports the patient’s appropriate use of buprenorphine. This function includes reminders, assessments of use, non-use and reasons and beliefs. reSET-O also has additional content modules specific to OUD. 
Similar to reSET, patients download reSET-O to their smart phone, tablet or VR headset for discreet, convenient access to therapy, interactive treatment, learning, and support. reSET-O lets patients practice what their clinicians taught them anytime, anywhere, and report daily triggers, cravings, and substance use so they feel more engaged and supported between appointments. 
reSET-O also encourages patients with tangible rewards via its CM capabilities. These rewards can be managed by clinicians. 
As the patient undergoes therapy with reSET-O, the patient and clinician continue to meet in person or virtually as part of their outgoing treatment therapy, and the clinician has real-time access via the Pear MD Clinician Dashboard to monitor and adjust treatment. 
Our Clinical Trial Data 
There have been multiple RCTs evaluating PDTs in patients with OUD in combination with MAT and Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (“MOUD”). These studies have been conducted across a variety of durations and clinical care models. The primary RCT that FDA reviewed to support marketing authorization of reSET-O is described below. 
In summary, the clinical data demonstrated that adding reSET-O alongside outpatient treatment and buprenorphine use increased retention of patients with OUD by 14% at the end of the 12-week trial and reduced opioid use. Patients achieving no substance use by end of treatment was 75.9% in TAU + PDT group versus 60.6% in TAU-alone (p = 0.03). Patients in the TAU + PDT group had an 82.4% retention rate compared to 68.4% in the TAU group (p = 0.02). The observed adverse events were of a type and frequency as anticipated in a large population of patients with OUD or associated with buprenorphine pharmacotherapy, particularly during the induction phase. The adverse events observed were not adjudicated to be device-related. 
A block-randomized, parallel, 12-week treatment trial was conducted with 170 opioid-dependent adult patients. Participants received an internet-based community reinforcement approach intervention plus CM (“CRA+”) and buprenorphine, or CM-alone plus buprenorphine. 
•All patients received 30 minutes of face-to-face clinician interaction every other week.
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 22


•Patients provided urine samples three times per week to objectively monitor substance use.
•Primary endpoints were:
▪retention in treatment, and
▪no substance use (during last four weeks).
Incorporation of a PDT increased retention and abstinence 

 | TAU + PDT | | TAU | | p-value
Retention | 82.4 | % | | 68.4 | % | 20.00
No Substance Use (last 4 weeks) | 77.3 | % | | 62.1 | % | 30.00

Among patients whose primary addiction was opioids, adding reSET-O to TAU had significantly greater odds of opioid abstinence during weeks 9-12 of the 12-week trial with abstinence rates (no opioids) at 77.3% for the TAU + reSET-O treatment group versus 62.1% for the TAU group (p = 0.02). Further, adding reSET-O to outpatient therapy buprenorphine increased retention of patients with OUD by 14% at the end of the 12-week trial, with retention found to be 82.4% in the TAU + reSET-O treatment group versus 68.4% in the TAU group (p = 0.02). 
Overall safety was in line with expectations and no significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse events between groups (p = 0.42). The observed adverse events were of a type and frequency as anticipated in a large population of patients with OUD or associated with buprenorphine pharmacotherapy, particularly during the induction phase. The adverse events observed were not adjudicated to be device related. 
Real World Evidence 
Pear continues to generate RWE evaluating the use of reSET-O across prospective and commercial use. We plan to continue to publish and disseminate reSET-O real-world data. 
For example, a published real-world analysis evaluated patient engagement, usage of reSET-O and associated outcomes of opioid use and treatment retention in those using buprenorphine MAT/MOUD. The results demonstrated that reSET-O is readily and broadly used by patients with OUD and that real-world therapeutic engagement is positively associated with abstinence and retention in treatment. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 23


The real-world observational analysis was conducted in a population of 3,144 patients with OUD who were prescribed their first 12-week prescription for reSET-O. The patients came from 30 different states and represented a wide range of demographics (15.4% of individuals were between ages 19-29, 45.5% were between 30-39, 25% were between 40-49, 11.2% were between 50-59, and 2.9% were age 60 or older). 
A summary of results is set forth below: 
•Patients in the 40-49 age range had highest level of “Active” days of treatment.
•80% of patients completed at least 25% of core modules, 66% completed half of all core modules, and 49% completed all core modules across the entire cohort of patients.
•Patients exhibited usage of reSET-O across a 24-hour period, including before and after clinic hours, at times when clinicians would not traditionally be available.
•Over 70% of patients were retained in reSET-O treatment and continued to use their PDT during the last 4 weeks.
•91% of the patients were “responders”, meaning 80% of their self-reports and urine drug screens (“UDS”) were negative for illicit opioid use.
•Patient engagement on reSET-O was higher than other products as shown in the chart below.
Patient Engagement on reSET-O Compared to Other Products

Patients have also benefited from repeat prescriptions for reSET-O. Another peer-reviewed study evaluated the impact of longer-term (24 week) engagement and use of reSET-O in a sample of 3,817 patients) and found increased abstinence (86%) and retention in treatment (91%), and 94.4% met the responder rate of being abstinent for at least 80% of the weeks of treatment.
Healthcare Economic & Outcomes Research 
Pear continues to generate real-world evidence evaluating the use of reSET-O. 
reSET-O’s impact on healthcare resource utilization has been demonstrated in two separate analyses. In the first study there was a per-patient reduction of $2,150 in the six months after reSET-O initiation vs. a six-month 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 24


baseline, and there was a $2,708 difference vs controls at nine months, driven largely in both instances by reductions in emergency department visits and inpatient stay-associated costs.
A follow-on analysis of this patient population examined the cost implications for payers, and found real-world cost reductions of $2,385 six months after product initiation (vs. the six-month baseline period) for a typical US payer after factoring in rebates. This analysis also showed that the number-needed-to-treat, i.e., the number of patients you need to treat to prevent one additional hospital-related event, was just 4.8 treated patients.
In addition, an analysis of the impact of a second prescription of reSET-O using a linear regression model found a further 27% reduction in hospital-related events with a second prescription for reSET-O (24 weeks of treatment), compared to the first (12 weeks of treatment). 
In addition to clinical value, these results support the cost-savings benefit of reSET-O as an adjunct to TAU.
Somryst 
Somryst is the only non-drug FDA-authorized and guideline-recommended treatment for chronic insomnia in adults over 22 years of age. It is intended to improve patients’ symptoms of chronic insomnia. Somryst is the first PDT submitted through FDA’s traditional 510(k) pathway while simultaneously reviewed as part of FDA’s Software Precertification Pilot Program to help build and test FDA’s Digital Health Precertification Working Model 1.0. Somryst is a nine-week prescription-only treatment. Somryst has been the subject of 29 completed clinical studies and ongoing clinical studies. 
Disease Overview 
Insomnia is a sleep disorder that manifests as difficulty falling or remaining asleep. Insomnia can be a short-term (e.g., acute) or a long-term (e.g., chronic) condition. Chronic insomnia is classified as persistent insomnia that occurs at least three nights a week for a period of at least three months. Chronic insomnia is a relatively common medical condition in the US, and is estimated to affect approximately 30 million Americans. 
Chronic insomnia adversely affects many facets of a patient’s everyday quality of life, including social, occupational, and educational. These reductions in a patient’s daily quality of life can also give rise to more serious, and life-threatening medical conditions, including depression, suicidality, hypertension, and heart attacks. For example, in patients with chronic insomnia approximately 40% have depression and up to 35% have anxiety. Chronic insomnia also results in a plethora of more measurable detrimental consequences, including heavy costs and resource utilization strain on the healthcare system. For example, annual medical costs for patients diagnosed with insomnia are approximately 25% higher relative to those without insomnia. 
Current options for the treatment of chronic insomnia are limited, and the available treatment options have thus far proven ineffective. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the American College of Physicians clinical guidelines recommend CBTi as the first-line treatment for patients suffering from chronic insomnia. However, CBTi is difficult to access, as fewer than 300 certified and licensed CBTi clinicians currently exist in the US to treat a patient population of approximately 30 million. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 25


Despite the clinical guidance recommending CBTi as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, over 50% of chronic insomnia patients do not seek CBTi treatment, but instead rely on the use of sleep medications (e.g., “sleeping pills”), such as Ambien (zolpidem). Because most available sleep medications are only recommended for short-term use, they are not recommended as a long-term solution to chronic insomnia. Long-term use of sleep medications can yield unwanted side-effects and result in serious, adverse health consequences. Further, utilization of sleep medications can result in reliance on the medication for sleep induction, rather than addressing the underlying condition, thereby perpetuating the chronic nature of the disease. 
Our Solution 
We believe Somryst addresses the limitations of current standard of care by treating the underlying factors without a label risk of dependence, inappropriate use, and adverse effects of pharmacotherapy. Somryst effectively delivers all three primary mechanisms of actions provided by face-to-face CBTi (sleep restriction and consolidation, cognitive restructuring, and stimulus control), using Pear’s software-based PDT. By delivering CBTi digitally, barriers to people with chronic insomnia are reduced while receiving guideline-recommended treatment. The following is a brief description of each mechanism of action. 
•Sleep restriction and consolidation reduces the time it takes to fall-to-sleep and reduces amount of wakefulness in the middle of the night by consolidating the patient’s sleep through an algorithm to direct the patient’s sleep-wake pattern.
•Cognitive restructuring teaches patients to identify maladaptive thought patterns related to sleep circuits and replace and strengthen healthy neurocircuits.
•Stimulus control teaches patients to identify behaviors, thoughts, and practices that increase arousal and limit sleep and then to correct those behaviors.
Patients are prescribed Somryst by their clinician. After downloading the PDT to a smart phone, tablet or VR headset, patients engage in fully digital, automated, and interactive exercises that move patients through the mechanisms of action to get better sleep. These interactive modules span a range of topics including properly tracking sleep patterns and identifying stimulants that may be harming sleep quality and restructuring maladaptive thoughts about sleep. Patients use Somryst for approximately 45-60 minutes weekly, over a period of 6-9 weeks. The content and interface encourages engagement, facilitates active learning, and promotes behavioral change, while the algorithm supports a tailored experience. 
Our Clinical Trial Data 
Somryst provides a clinician-facing dashboard that allows healthcare providers to track patient treatment and progress. The PearMD Clinician Dashboard displays information about patients’ use of Somryst, including the Insomnia Severity Index (“ISI”), the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 scores, and sleep metrics derived from nightly sleep diaries (“Sleep-Onset-Latency” or “SOL”) and Wakefulness-After-Sleep-Onset (“WASO”). The evidence base for Somryst is extensive and includes the following: 
•Somryst has been examined in an aggregate of 29 completed and ongoing studies. FDA submission and authorization was supported by two RCTs with an aggregate of more than 1,400 adults with chronic insomnia. The data from the RCTs showed a 45% decrease in the severity of insomnia symptoms, a 50% decrease in depression symptoms and nearly a 45% decrease in anxiety symptom. It has also demonstrated a durable effect on insomnia, depression, and anxiety for up to 18 months. 
•In a clinical trial of 303 patients with chronic insomnia (Study 1), those on treatment demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in insomnia severity, SOL (time to fall asleep), and WASO (time awake at night) at the end of treatment, as well as at six and 12 months follow-up compared to active control. Results of the study were published in JAMA Psychiatry.
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 26


•In a separate study of 1,149 adult patients with chronic insomnia and depressive symptoms (Study 2), those on treatment for nine weeks saw a significant reduction in insomnia severity measurements compared to controls.
The majority of patients randomized to the Somryst arm no longer met clinical criteria for insomnia at the end of the nine-week treatment. Patients were examined at baseline, nine weeks, six months, 12 months and 18 months following treatment. At treatment end, the patients who received Somryst experienced a decrease in their mean ISI score to 7.3 from baseline of mean 15.9, while the control arm had a reduction to 13.2 from 16.2 baseline. In addition, the Somryst group had a reduction in depression severity to a mean score of 3.8 from an 8.0 baseline mean. The mean score decreased to 6.2 from a mean of 7.8 at baseline in control subjects. It was observed that the clinical improvements were maintained to 18 months post-treatment. Study data, published in Lancet Psychiatry, showed decreases in anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation. 
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (“DSM-5”) makes no distinction between primary and comorbid insomnia. This previous distinction had been of questionable relevance in clinical practice and a diagnosis of insomnia is made if an individual meets the diagnostic criteria, despite any coexisting conditions. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition criteria are consistent with the changes to the DSM-5. 
The DSM-5 defines insomnia as dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms: 
•Difficulty initiating sleep;
•Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning to sleep after awakenings; and
•Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep
Other criteria include the following: 
•The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairments in social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning;
•The sleep difficulty occurs at least three nights per week;
•The sleep difficulty is present for at least three months;
•The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep;
•The insomnia cannot be explained by and does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep-wake disorder;
•The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse or medication; and
•Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of insomnia

Real World Evidence and Health Economics & Outcomes Research 
Pear continues to generate RWE and HEOR data in patients with chronic insomnia. 
A real-world deployment with 7,414 patients who utilized Somryst evaluated the benefits and health outcomes. In the real-world experience, patients utilized the product for nine weeks, consisting of six treatment modules. Data were collected on the FDA-reviewed endpoint, ISI, patient reported outcomes, and over 300,000 sleep diaries. As shown in the figures below, ISI, SOL, and WASO scores saw meaningful decreases as patients progressed through the six treatment modules. 
Patient Engagement, ISI Score, SOL and WASO by completed core of the six cores in Somryst. 
Dynamic Evidence Generation 
We believe that PDTs have an advantage over molecular therapeutics because data of product usage, patient-reported, and clinical outcomes of PDTs may be captured more rapidly. These data collected in studies as well as in commercial use facilitate regular evidence generation. Pear’s platform can facilitate linking healthcare resource utilization in the form of public and private insurance claims. Pear is able to rapidly scale evidence (clinical and health economic) and analyze across care-settings, specific populations, regions, and customers. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 29


This evidence continuum is a key competitive advantage of Pear and its platform. Pear plans to continue to expand evidence for its PDTs in additional RCTs, RWE, and health-economic evaluation to support continued product improvement, and to generate information for clinicians, and value for payors. 
Our Development Pipeline 
PDTs have the potential to treat many diverse diseases directly and enhance health outcomes for patients. We have 14 product candidates in our pipeline, including ten product candidates in psychiatry and neurology, our two initial areas of focus to support our self-commercialization strategy, and four candidates in other therapeutic areas as set forth below.
*Dartmouth transaction is with a researcher employed by Dartmouth. Pear has no direct contractual relationship with Dartmouth relating to this content.
**Karolinska transaction is with individual researchers who are employed by the Karolinska Institute. Pear has no direct contractual relationship with the Karolinska Institute relating to this content.
***Services agreement with Ironwood to evaluate a PDT in GI diseases.
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 30


We are initially building a portfolio of psychiatry and then neurology-focused PDTs. We also have early-stage programs in GI, oncology, and cardiovascular indications. Our near-term focus is to expand our leadership in psychiatry by developing PDTs for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (“AUD”), depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. These four additions have the potential to help fill the need for additional treatment options and enhance the offering to mental and behavioral health clinicians and psychiatrists while supporting payors’ need to reduce morbidity and cost in these indications. 
Additional details about our four key research and development projects in our pipeline are set forth below:

Pear acquired two clinical 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 32


state depression product candidates in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is in the process of integrating those product candidates into PEAR-015. 
•Expected Use: Potential for monotherapy and combination therapy
•Objective: To develop a PDT that could be used alone and/or in combination with pharmacotherapy to treat patients with Depression
•Current Status and Next Steps: This product candidate is at the Discovery stage. Once the new product candidates are integrated into PEAR-015, it will require clinical studies, and if promising, would then in the future be evaluated in a potential pivotal clinical trial to support potential FDA submission.
•Risks and Uncertainties: There are many failures of therapeutics while in development for psychiatric diseases like Depression. There are no existing FDA-market authorized PDTs for Depression on the market.
•Development activities for product candidates have a number of risks and uncertainties. All therapeutic development activities have risk and probabilities of success that can vary by disease indication. In many of the disease areas Pear is developing product candidates there is a long history of failure. The areas of mental and behavioral health or neuropsychiatry, which is a primary focus for Pear, have had notable failures across biotech, pharma, and digital health. Each of Pear’s pipeline candidates have technical, clinical, regulatory, and commercial risk. See the heading “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Pear’s Products— If the Company is not able to develop and release new products, or successful enhancements, new features and modifications to the Company’s existing products, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information on risks related to product development.
Additional specific risks and uncertainties also include but are not limited to: 
•each potential therapeutic must achieve levels of use by the patient in their disease population sufficient for the evidence-based treatment or mechanism of action to exert its behavioral and/or biologic effect. If levels of product use or engagement are not high enough a study may not be successful and a product candidate may not be viable;
•even if patients do engage at sufficient levels, the proposed evidence-based treatment or scientific mechanism of action may not be effective in achieving the desired clinical outcome;
•clinical trials may fail for numerous reasons including operational complexities, difficulty in measurement, challenges in enrollment, adverse events and safety events, poor endpoints, variabilities amongst sites, protocol deviations, and many others; and
•the technology, such as algorithms or engineering, may fail.
Ongoing PDT discovery 
There are two categories of PDT’s interventional mechanisms of action. The first is delivery of neurobehavioral interventions. These are scientific and evidence-based practices, many of which we know work from face-to-face delivery, and target affected disease-specific neurocircuitry. Examples include CBT, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, exposure therapy, and CM. The second category is dose-optimization. In diseases where pharmacotherapy exists, PDTs can be integrated with the molecular therapeutic to assess patient response and optimize medication dose and frequency. Use cases include titrating a medication to therapeutic effect, optimizing chronic dosing, tapering medication, and recommending dosing as needed when a disease exacerbation is occurring. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 33


We believe utilizing both categories of interventional mechanisms of action will facilitate further pipeline expansion. Pear’s existing PDT candidates in neurologic diseases including epilepsy, pain, and multiple sclerosis, have potential to increase the patient populations and addressable markets. 
Gastroenterology, cardiology, and oncology are particularly promising therapeutic areas. In oncology, combining dose-optimization of immuno-oncology drugs (which could target both solid or liquid tumors) with neurobehavioral mechanisms of action, multi-modal PDTs could optimize both the treatment of cancer directly and the behavioral disorders that often coincide with cancer treatment. For example, by utilizing labs, patient-reported outcomes, and sensor data, recommendations to refine the dosing and frequency of chemotherapeutic agents to reduce dose-limiting toxicities and maximize overall-survival can be integrated with CBTi for insomnia in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Similar approaches may be deployed in GI and cardiovascular. 
In addition, we will continue our strategic pursuit of enabling technologies, such as digital sensors, that may be used to enhance our products and product candidates. 
We expect to significantly grow our pipeline through internal discovery efforts, in-licensing, and acquisition. We continue to seek to accumulate early-stage clinical assets and technologies for development. We believe our scalable infrastructure to discover, develop, and deliver these products to patients will allow us to be a partner of choice for development, regulatory, and commercial stage deals. 
Competition 
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and digital health industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and an emphasis on proprietary products. While Pear believes that Pear’s technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide Pear with competitive advantages, Pear faces potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, digital health companies, and academic institutions. To drive continual technology advantage, Pear seeks patent protection and establishes collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of evidence-based therapeutics. Any products that Pear successfully develops and commercializes will compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Pear competes in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop therapeutics as treatments, in particular treatments for addiction (reSET and reSET-O) and insomnia (Somryst). There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing such treatments for addiction and insomnia including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Alkermes and their product Vivitrol, Orexo and their product Zubsolv, Sandoz and their product Suboxone, Braeburn and their product Brixadi, Pfizer and their product Halcion, Merck and their product Belsomra, Sunovion and their product Lunesta and Sanofi and their product Ambien. 
Pear’s competitors in the digital health space, with specific focus in addiction and insomnia have created non-regulated products, are not supported by randomized controlled trials to support treatment claims, such as Dynamicare, CBT4CBT and Orexo and their product Modia, and Big Health and their products Sleepio, Pzizz, and Calm. 
Rather, Pear believes the competitive landscape is best understood by comparing the primary mechanism of action (behavioral support/intervention or improving medication adherence and tracking); to the business model for patient acquisition (apps marketed direct-to-consumer; tech-enabled healthcare services offered to members of health plans, most often those of self-insured employers; or regulated products prescribed by providers). 
While some solutions have evolved to include elements of various mechanisms such as behavioral support, reminders for medication adherence, or remote monitoring and transmission of biometric data, in Pear’s view, each has a primary mechanism for affecting disease and a clearly defined model for acquiring patients or consumers. 
To Pear’s knowledge, Pear’s reSET and reSET-O are the only FDA-authorized PDTs with a direct treatment-related claim for addiction, and Pear’s Somryst is the only FDA-authorized PDT with a direct treatment-related claim for 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 34


chronic insomnia that can be prescribed by providers and reimbursed by insurance. This has required Pear to generate significant evidence to demonstrate safety, effectiveness, clinical outcomes and distinct impact on the total cost of care. While many early market entrants (in fact, nearly 360,000 health and wellness apps are now available in Apple’s App Store) are making marketing claims related to the ability to help treat addiction and insomnia, Pear believes the landscape will change dramatically when new solutions that can be prescribed by providers and covered by insurance become broadly available. 
There are a number of companies in the prescription digital therapeutics space but none of these companies have commercialized an FDA-authorized prescription digital therapeutic to target addiction or insomnia at this time. Other than Pear, we are aware of three companies that have received FDA-authorization to make medical claims as prescription digital therapeutics. This includes Akili Interactive Labs and their product Endeavor for ADHD, Mahana Therapeutics and their product Parallel for IBS and Nightware for patients with PTSD that are experiencing nightmares. Other companies of which Pear is aware in the space that have not received FDA-authorization and are not authorized to make medical claims but may pursue FDA-authorization in the future include: (i) Click Therapeutics in Depression, (ii) Better Therapeutics in Cardiometabolic, (iii) Cognoa in Autism, (iv) AppliedVR in Pain, (v) Orexo and GAIA AG in Depression, (vi) MedRhythms in Stroke, and (vii) Blue Note Therapeutics for Cancer Related Anxiety and Depression. 
License Agreements 
We have rights to use and exploit technologies disclosed in issued and pending patents and other therapeutic content under licenses and/or assignment agreements with other entities (collectively, “License Agreements”). We consider the commercial terms of these License Agreements, which provide for milestone and royalty payments, and their provisions regarding diligence, insurance, indemnification, and other similar matters, to be reasonable and customary for our industry. 
The material License Agreements related to our three commercial products are those with The Invention Science Fund I, LLC (“ISF”), Red 5 Group, LLC (“Red 5”), and BeHealth Solutions, LLC (“BeHealth”). 
The Invention Science Fund I, LLC 
We entered into a contribution and license agreement with ISF in February 2015, as amended on February 28, 2018 (the “ISF Agreement”), pursuant to which ISF grants the Company certain licenses under specified patent rights to develop and commercialize licensed products either independently and/or in combination with a drug for use in connection with the treatment of central nervous system disorders. The oldest patent in the family is expected to expire in 2028. 
Under the terms of the ISF Agreement, we are required to pay a minimum annual royalty, capped at low-seven figures per year. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have paid ISF $2.6 million in minimum annual royalties, and for the year ended December 31, 2021 recorded annual minimum royalties payable of $1.0 million. The ISF Agreement also requires us to pay a royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed patents that do not include drugs. To date, no royalties have been paid on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed patents that do not include drugs. In addition, as to sales of products covered by the in-licensed patents that do include drugs, the ISF Agreement requires us to pay either (i) a royalty percentage on net sales in the low single digits or (ii) an annual fee based on net sales. To date, no royalties have been paid on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed patents that include drugs. 
Under the ISF Agreement, ISF covenants that neither it nor any of its affiliates will sue, or assert any claim against (or cause any third party to sue or assert any claim against) us for infringement of any patent covered under the ISF Agreement with respect to our permitted use of such patents under the ISF Agreement (the “Covenant”). 
In consideration of the Covenant granted to us in the ISF Agreement, the ISF Agreement requires us to pay an annual covenant fee (the “Covenant Fee”) in a variable amount ranging from mid-to-high five digits to a low-six figures per year through December 2030. Through December 31, 2021, we have paid ISF $0.3 million in annual Covenant Fees. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 35


The ISF Agreement will terminate upon the expiration or invalidation of all of the patents subject to the license. Additionally, ISF may terminate the ISF Agreement upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the ISF Agreement, and we may terminate the ISF Agreement 90 days after providing written notice to ISF. The Covenant, and our related obligation to pay the annual Covenant Fee, may be terminated by us 30 days after providing written notice to ISF. 
Red 5 Group, LLC
In January 2015, we entered into a software license agreement with Red 5, and on March 21, 2018, the parties entered into an amended and restated software license agreement which was further amended on July 1, 2021 to clarify certain terms and increase the royalty rate by a de minimis amount (such agreement, as amended, “Amended Red 5 Group License”). Under the Amended Red 5 Group License, Red 5 grants us, inter alia, an exclusive (other than a limited reserved right for ongoing academic studies), worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize integrated products incorporating certain technology and documentation materials relating to the treatment of psychological and substance use disorders. Under the Amended Red 5 Group License, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop integrated products in accordance with a development plan, to introduce any integrated products that gain regulatory approval into the commercial markets, to market integrated products that have gained regulatory approval following such introduction into the market, and to make integrated products that have gained regulatory approval reasonably available to the public. 
In March 2018, the parties amended the original Red 5 agreement, and we subsequently paid an amendment fee in the high-six figures in consideration for expanding the scope of our exclusive license. On July 1, 2021, the parties amended the Amended Red 5 Group License to further clarify certain terms and increase the royalty rate by a de minimis amount. 
To the extent achieved, we are obligated to pay Red 5 up to an aggregate of $0.4 million if certain milestones related to product regulatory approval and commercial sales are achieved in respect to a software/drug combination, which we are not currently pursuing. Each such regulatory and sales milestone is payable only once. 
The Amended Red 5 Group License also requires us to pay a single digit royalty percentage on net revenue from integrated products. Through December 31, 2021, we have recorded $1.3 million in royalties to Red 5. We are also required to make annual maintenance fee payments capped at a sum in the low-six figures per year, creditable against future royalty and milestone payment obligations. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have recorded $0.4 million of annual maintenance fees under the terms of the agreement. In addition, we have a credit in the mid-six figures against future royalty and milestone payment obligations. 
The Amended Red 5 Group License will continue in perpetuity unless terminated in accordance with its terms, under which Red 5 may terminate the license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license, and we may terminate the license 60 days after providing written notice to Red 5. 
BeHealth Solutions, LLC
We entered into an assignment, license and services agreement with BeHealth, effective March 24, 2018 (the “BeHealth Agreement”), which relates to software, documentation, and intellectual property rights in and to certain therapeutic content related to cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia and other sleep disorders that BeHealth licensed from University of Virginia Patent Foundation d/b/a University of Virginia Licensing & Ventures Group (“UVA LVG”). 
Under the terms of the BeHealth Agreement, we paid an initial up-front fee in the mid-six figures to BeHealth, and during the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid a milestone payment to BeHealth of $0.8 million upon the FDA’s acceptance of a filing seeking marketing authorization for Somryst that was recorded as a research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the period then ended. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid a milestone payment to BeHealth of $0.8 million upon the FDA’s marketing authorization of Somryst. The milestone payment was capitalized in other long-term assets and amortized on a straight-line basis to cost of product revenue over the estimated useful life, which was ten 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 36


years at initial recognition. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $1.0 million related to the achievement of a commercial milestone. Each such regulatory and sales milestone is payable only once, and no other milestone payment may become due and payable after March 24, 2028. Assuming that we meet the remaining commercial milestones, the Company could be obligated to make payments of up to an additional $26.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of various annual commercial milestones and a mid-to-high-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales to BeHealth. 
Because the underlying license agreement (with exclusive rights relating to content and non-exclusive rights relating to the underlying platform) between BeHealth and UVA LVG was assigned to us, we owe a royalty percentage in the mid-single digits on net sales of integrated products to UVA LVG. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the assigned license agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such sublicense income in the low-double digits to UVA LVG. We are required to make annual minimum royalty payments in the low-five figures to UVA LVG under the assigned license agreement, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. Through December 31, 2021, we have recorded only de minimis royalties under the UVA LVG assigned license agreement and we have paid de minimis royalties, $2.5 million in milestone payments, and $0.5 million in other fees to BeHealth. We have a buyout option in the assigned license agreement under which we may pay UVA LVG a lump sum of $1.0 million in exchange for a perpetual royalty-free license in the field. 
The underlying license from UVA LVG will continue in perpetuity unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the assigned license agreement, under which UVA LVG may terminate the license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license, and we may terminate the license at any time upon 30 days’ written notice to UVA LVG. 
Intellectual Property 
In addition to securing regulatory authorization for our PDTs, we make strategic use of various intellectual property regimes: patents; copyrights; trademarks; and trade secrets. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on copyrights (including copyright registrations for product source code), on trademarks, and on trade secrets relating to our proprietary PDT product development platform to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the PDT field. 
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other proprietary rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid, enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to limit third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, copyrights or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, enforcement of these rights may depend on third-party licensors or co-owners. With respect to both company-owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products. 
Patent expiration dates noted below refer to statutory expiration dates and do not take into account any potential patent term adjustment or extension that may be available.

Licensed Patent Assets 
As discussed above in “License Agreements - ISF”, we are the exclusive licensee within a broad field of use to a portfolio of patents directed to combinational drug and prescription digital therapy treatment. Nineteen US patents have been allowed in this portfolio, the patents expiring between 2028 and, at the latest, 2036. Those patents encompass more than 550 granted claims directed to drug/software combinations and that may potentially cover aspects of current or future PDTs. One US patent applications is pending in this portfolio. If granted, the pending patent application would expire in 2028. As exclusive licensee, we play a pivotal role in the ongoing prosecution of this portfolio. 
Registered Copyrights 
In addition to our portfolio of utility and design patents, we hold copyright in each of our PDTs and pursue federal copyright registration where appropriate. We have registered copyright in the source code for each of our commercial products with the US Copyright Office. 
Registered Trademarks 
Beyond patent and copyright protection, we also protect our valuable trademarks and associated brand recognition by registering trademarks with the US Patent and Trademark Office. We own seven US trademark 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 38


registrations covering goods and services in multiple classes. Our federally registered trademarks are PEAR THERAPEUTICS, the Pear logo, RESET, RESET-O, and SOMRYST. Certain of our RESET and RESET-O trademark applications and registrations are the subject of ongoing opposition and cancellation proceedings, respectively. 
Government Regulation 
Insurance and Coverage 
In the US and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Pear’s ability to successfully commercialize Pear’s product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Sales of product candidates that Pear may identify will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of Pear’s product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, and other third-party payors. 
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the US, a key decision-maker about reimbursement for new products is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and several US private payors tend to follow CMS to some degree. 
In determining reimbursement, payors generally consider whether the product is: 
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a treatment, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the treatment, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, biological products, and medical devices, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and clinicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and clinicians prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use Pear’s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of Pear’s products. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly authorized products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is authorized by FDA. 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
Pear is subject to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the US federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the US federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which Pear sells, markets and distributes Pear’s 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 39


products. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry (e.g., healthcare providers, clinicians and third-party payors), are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Pear also may be subject to patient information and privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which Pear conducts its business. The applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect Pear’s ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties. On December 2, 2020, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. This rule, with certain exceptions, became effective January 19, 2021. Implementation of this change is currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. Pear continues to evaluate what effect, if any, the rule will have on Pear’s business; 
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement of record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A person can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;
•Applicable privacy laws and regulations, including HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-US laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 40


•The US federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; and
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
•Additionally, Pear is subject to state equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many states in the US have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to Pear’s business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require medical device manufacturers to make marketing or price disclosures to the state, and may also require that medical device manufacturers, such as Pear, maintain licenses to manufacture and/or distribute products within their state. State laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if Pear fails to comply with an applicable state law requirement, Pear could be subject to penalties.
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including protected health information. These laws and regulations, including their interpretation by governmental agencies, are subject to frequent change and could have a negative impact on Pear’s business. In addition, in the future, industry requirements or guidance, contractual obligations, and/or legislation at both the federal and the state level may limit, forbid or regulate the use or transmission of health information outside of the US. 
These varying interpretations can create complex compliance issues for Pear and Pear’s partners and potentially expose Pear to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability, any of which could adversely affect Pear’s business. 
Federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the FTC and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or personally identifiable information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content. 
The security measures that Pear and Pear’s third-party vendors and subcontractors have in place to ensure compliance with privacy and data protection laws may not protect Pear’s facilities and systems from security breaches, ransomware acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and human errors or other similar events. Even though Pear provides for appropriate protections through Pear’s agreements with Pear’s third-party vendors, Pear still has limited control over their actions and practices. A breach of privacy or security of personally identifiable health information may result in an enforcement action, including criminal and civil liability, against us. Pear is not able to predict the extent of the impact such incidents may have on Pear’s business. Enforcement actions against Pear could be costly and could interrupt regular operations, which may adversely affect Pear’s business. While Pear has not received any notices of violation of the applicable privacy 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 41


and data protection laws and we believe Pear is in compliance with such laws, there can be no assurance that Pear will not receive such notices in the future. 
There is ongoing concern from privacy advocates, regulators and others regarding data privacy and security issues, and the number of jurisdictions with data privacy and security laws has been increasing. Also, there are ongoing public policy discussions regarding whether the standards for de-identification, anonymization or pseudonymization of health information are sufficient, and the risk of re-identification sufficiently small, to adequately protect patient privacy. Pear expects that there will continue to be new proposed and amended laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the US, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and has been amended several times. Further, a new California privacy law, the CPRA, was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). Additionally, a new Virginia privacy law, the VCDPA, was signed into law on March 2, 2021 and is also scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”) which was passed by the state legislature and is awaiting the governor’s signature, will take effect on July 1, 2023. The VCDPA and CPA will impose many similar obligations regarding the processing and storing of personal information as the CCPA and the CPRA. Other states in the Unites States also are considering omnibus privacy legislation, and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. While the CCPA, CPRA, CPA and VCDPA contain exceptions for certain activities involving protected health information already regulated under HIPAA, Pear cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA, CPA, VCDPA or other such future laws, regulations and standards may have on Pear’s business. 
Healthcare Legislative Reform 
In both the US and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could impact Pear’s ability to sell Pear’s products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the ACA was enacted, which contained a number of measures aimed at controlling healthcare costs. 
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and Pear expects there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Additionally, the Trump administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost-sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. Further, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. Pear cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on Pear’s business, especially given the new administration. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the US since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. The CARES Act suspended the sequestration payment adjustment percentage of 2% applied to all Medicare Fee-for-Service claims from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, extended the suspension period to March 31, 2021. An Act to Prevent Across-the-Board Direct Spending Cuts, and for Other Purposes, signed into law on April 14, 2021, extends the suspension period to December 31, 2021. 
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the US with respect to prescription-pricing practices. It is unclear what effect such legislative and enforcement interest may have on prescription devices. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 42


Further, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify the prior administration’s executive and administrative actions. 
Pear expects that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that Pear received for any approved device, which could have an adverse effect on customers for Pear’s product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels in the US directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent Pear from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize Pear’s products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that Pear may successfully develop and for which Pear may obtain regulatory approval and that may affect Pear’s overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. If Pear or any third parties Pear may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if Pear or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, Pear’s current or any future product candidates Pear may develop may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and Pear may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
FDA Regulation 
United States 
Pear’s products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the US The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance, authorization, or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export and post-marketing surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, mandatory recalls, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 
Generally, establishments that design and/or manufacture devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA. They also must provide the FDA with a list of the devices that they design and/or manufacture at their facilities. 
The FDA enforces its requirements by market surveillance and periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to inspect or re-inspect equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a Form 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are sufficiently severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a Form 483 or warning letter, the FDA make take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include: 
•cease and desist orders;
•injunctions or consent decrees;
•civil monetary penalties;
•recall, detention or seizure of products;
•operating restrictions, partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 43


•refusal of or delay in granting requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or premarket approval of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo authorizations, or premarket approvals that are already granted;
•refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for devices; and
•criminal prosecution.
FDA’s Pre-market Clearance, Authorization and Approval Requirements 
Each prescription digital therapeutic Pear seeks to commercially distribute in the US will require either a prior de novo authorization, 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a Premarket Approval (“PMA”) from FDA under its medical device authorities. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already classified as Class II, FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance. If there is no legally marketed predicate device and general controls alone or with special controls provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, FDA will allow the new device to be marketed under a de novo authorization; otherwise, a PMA is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FD&C Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are moderate risk. They are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls. Special controls include, for example, performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. Devices deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the US unless FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class III devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in order to commercially distribute these devices. FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner. There is no guarantee that a submission to FDA will result in a clearance, authorization, or approval. In addition, various review process and goals to which applications are currently subject are the result of Medical Device User Fee Act (“MDUFA”) IV, which expires after September 30, 2022; negotiations for enactment of a MDUFA V law and adoption of associated goals are ongoing. 
While most Class I and some Class II devices may be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most other medical devices can be legally sold within the US only if the FDA has: (i) approved a PMA application prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a 510(k) submission, generally applicable to some Class I and most Class II devices; or (iii) authorized the device to be marketed through the de novo classification process, generally applicable for novel Class I or II devices. 
510(k) Clearance Pathway 
Product marketing in the US for most Class II and a limited number of Class I devices typically follows the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. When a 510(k) clearance is required, Pear must submit a pre-market notification to FDA demonstrating that Pear’s proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as a “predicate device.” A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications, or a product previously placed in Class II or Class I through the de novo classification process. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the pre-market notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device. FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, FDA will place the device into Class III. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 44


There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional, special and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are for devices that are modified, and the modification needs a new 510(k) but does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. FDA has a user fee goal to apply no more than 90 calendar review days to traditional and abbreviated 510(k) submissions. During the process, FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 270 days. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt, although it can take longer, if FDA has questions. There are no guarantees that FDA meet its goals, although it has agreed to try to meet its 90 calendar day decision goals in 95% of 510(k) submissions for FY 2022. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for the modified device, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance, de novo authorization, or PMA approval is obtained. 
De Novo Classification 
When it is determined there is no legally marketed predicate device, the de novo process provides a pathway to classify novel low- or moderate-risk medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Medical device types that FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The de novo classification procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”), a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. Devices that are classified into Class I or Class II through a de novo classification request may be marketed and used as predicates for future premarket notification 510(k) submissions. 
FDA has a user fee goal to review a de novo request in 150 calendar review days (which FDA agreed to try and meet for 70% of De Novo submissions in FY 2022). During the process, FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be as long as 330 days. 
Pre-market Approval Pathway 
A Class III product not eligible for either 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA approval pathway. The PMA application process is generally more expensive, rigorous, lengthy, demanding, and uncertain than the 510(k) premarket notification or de novo process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing history, design, controls, and labeling to demonstrate to FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 45


FDA may convene an advisory panel of experts from outside FDA to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to FDA as to the safety and effectiveness of the device. Although FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to FDA’s overall decision-making process. In addition, FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance requirements. The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations. 
FDA has a user fee goal to review a PMA in 180 calendar review days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 320 review days if the submission does require advisory committee input. FDA has agreed to try to meet this goal in most cases for FY 2022, though it is not guaranteed. During the process, FDA may issue a major deficiency letter, which stops the review clock. The applicant has up to 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 360 days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 500 days if the submission does require advisory committee input. 
Upon completion of the PMA review, FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought and can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which FDA’s review clock is reset. 
Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. 
Breakthrough Devices 
The Breakthrough Devices Program is a voluntary program intended to expedite the review, development, assessment and review of certain medical devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human diseases or conditions for which no approved or cleared treatment exists or that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives. Submissions for devices designated as Breakthrough Devices will receive priority review, meaning that the review of the submission is placed at the top of the appropriate review queue and receives additional review resources, as needed and available. Although Breakthrough Device designation or access to any other expedited program may expedite the development or clearance/authorization/approval process, it does not change the standards for clearance/authorization/approval. Designation for any expedited review procedure does not ensure that we will ultimately obtain regulatory clearance or approval for such product. 
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA, are often required for a de novo authorization, and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials may also be conducted or continued to satisfy post-approval requirements for devices with PMAs. In the US, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) to FDA prior to initiating clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin. During the trial, the clinical

trial sponsor must comply with FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval, authorization, or clearance of the product. 
Sponsors of applicable clinical trials of devices are required to register with www.clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. 
Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The clinical trial sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. 
Ongoing Regulation by FDA 
Even after a device receives clearance, authorization, or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
•establishment registration and device listing;
•the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing, design, development, distribution, and labeling process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and
•post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
FDA regulations require manufacturers to register with FDA and to list the devices they market. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”) requires manufacturers to register within the state. Following these registrations, FDA and CDHS inspect manufacturers on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR and applicable state regulations. These regulations require that Pear manufacture Pear’s products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Other states 
Pear Therapeutics, Inc.| 2021 Form 10-K |Page 47


might also require non-resident licenses concerning distribution of devices into their states. Pear is also subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions: 
•warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of Pear’s products;
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
•withdrawing clearance, authorization, and/or approvals that have already been granted; and
•criminal prosecution.
The medical device reporting laws and regulations require manufacturers to provide information to FDA when they receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Failure to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, can subject a manufacturer to warning letters, recalls, or other sanctions and penalties. 
Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA and US Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FD&C Act and the FDA’s implementing regulations, and the Federal Trade Commission Act and FTC’s implementing regulations. The FDA’s and FTC’s oversight authority review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. 
Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling, and all claims must be truthful, non-misleading, and adequately substantiated. In addition, although healthcare providers may use medical devices in an off-label manner in accordance with the practice of medicine, FDA prohibits marketed devices from being marketed for off-label uses and regulates the advertising of certain devices as well. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution, including False Claims Act liability for products covered under the federal health care programs. 
Finally, newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a marketed product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of Pear’s products under development. 
Pear has three FDA-authorized products: reSET, reSET-O, and Somryst. Pear’s first product, reSET, obtained a de novo authorization as a Class II device. Pear’s second and third products, reSET-O and Somryst, obtained 510(k) clearance as Class II devices.
