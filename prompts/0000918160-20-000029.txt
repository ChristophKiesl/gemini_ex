Item 1. | Business.

Overview
AK Steel Holding Corporation (“AK Holding”) was formed under the laws of Delaware in 1993. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, AK Steel Corporation (“AK Steel”), it is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, primarily for the automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, and distributors and converters markets. Other subsidiaries also provide customer solutions with carbon and stainless steel tubing products, advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot- and cold-stamped steel components, and complex assemblies. AK Steel is the successor to Armco Inc. and has built upon Armco’s rich history of creating leading-edge steel innovations since its formation in 1899. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to AK Holding and its subsidiaries.
Our mission is to create innovative, high-quality steel solutions for our customers and our key values of safety, quality, productivity and innovation, along with environmental responsibility and sustainability, are its foundation. We have approximately 9,300 employees in North America and Europe, as well as manufacturing operations across seven states in the eastern U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Our corporate strategy is comprised of three pillars:

• | commercializing our innovative new products and services;


• | transforming our operations to significantly improve our competitive position; and


• | driving future growth into new markets and downstream businesses.

On December 2, 2019, we entered into an Agreement of Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) among us, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (“Cliffs”) and Pepper Merger Sub Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Cliffs (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permissible) waiver of the conditions set forth therein, Cliffs will acquire AK Holding by way of the merger of Merger Sub with and into AK Holding (the “Merger”), with AK Holding surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cliffs. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, AK Holding stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.40 Cliffs common shares for each outstanding share of AK Holding common stock they own at the effective time. Upon completion of the proposed Merger, it is expected that AK Holding stockholders will own approximately 32% and Cliffs shareholders will own approximately 68% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. We expect to complete the Merger in the first quarter of 2020, subject to the receipt of customary regulatory and stockholder approvals and the satisfaction or (to the extent permissible) waiver of the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement. See the discussion under Cleveland-Cliffs Acquisition in Item 7 for additional information.
Customers and Markets
We target customers who require comprehensive steel solutions that involve the most technically demanding, highest-quality steel products, “just-in-time” delivery, technical support and product development leadership. Our research and engineering expertise, robust product quality and delivery capabilities, as well as our emphasis on collaborative customer technical support and product planning, are critical factors in our ability to serve our customer markets. Our strategy is to focus on markets for our steel solutions that deliver higher margins, where possible, and reduce amounts sold into the typically lower-margin commodity spot markets, which have experienced substantial volatility in pricing over the past several years primarily as a result of shifting international trade environments and related effects on the domestic markets we serve.
We sell our products to customers in three broad market categories: (i) automotive; (ii) infrastructure and manufacturing, which includes electrical power; and (iii) distributors and converters. The following table presents the percentage of our net sales to each of these markets:

Market | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Automotive | 66 | % | | 63 | % | 65 | %
Infrastructure and Manufacturing | 16 | % | | | % | | %
Distributors and Converters | 18 | % | | 22 | % | 19 | %

We sold approximately 70% of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2019 under fixed base price contracts. These contracts are typically one year in duration and expire at various times throughout the year. Some of these contracts have a surcharge mechanism that passes 
- 1-



through certain changes in input costs. We sold the remainder of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2019 into the spot market at prevailing market prices or under contracts that involve variable pricing that is tied to an independently published steel index.
Automotive Market
The automotive industry is our core market, and we aim to address the principal needs of major automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. We specialize in manufacturing difficult-to-produce, high-quality steel products, combined with demanding delivery performance, customer technical support and collaborative relationships, to develop breakthrough steel solutions that help our customers meet their product requirements. In addition, many of our competitors do not have the capability to supply the full portfolio of products that we make for our automotive customers, such as steel for exposed automotive applications, the most sophisticated grades of advanced high-strength steels (“AHSS”) and value-added stainless steel products. The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally enable us to justify higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of carbon and stainless steels sold to other markets.
In light of the automotive market’s importance to us, North American light vehicle production has a significant impact on our total sales and shipments. North American light vehicle production for 2019 declined 4% to approximately 16.3 million units from the prior year, due in part to a strike at General Motors (“GM”) that halted its vehicle production for over one month. We currently expect a slight increase in North American light vehicle production in 2020. Furthermore, consumer demand for SUVs, trucks, crossovers and larger vehicles continued to increase while demand for smaller sedans and compact cars declined. We benefit from intentionally targeting larger vehicle platforms to take advantage of consumer preferences, and we have focused on and have been successful in getting sourced on numerous SUV, truck, crossover and larger vehicle platforms. As a result, more than three-quarters of the carbon automotive steel that we sell is used to produce these popular larger vehicles. In addition to benefiting from our exposure to consumers’ strong demand for larger vehicles, these vehicles also typically contain a higher volume of steel than smaller sedans and compact cars, providing us the opportunity to sell a greater proportion of our steel products to our automotive customers. Ford Motor Company (“Ford”) accounted for 11% of our net sales in both 2019 and 2018, and FCA (an affiliate of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.) accounted for 11% and 10% of our net sales in 2019 and 2018. No other customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in either year.
Automotive manufacturers are under pressure to achieve heightened federally mandated fuel economy standards through 2025 (the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or “CAFE,” standards). The CAFE standards generally require automobile manufacturers to meet an average fuel economy goal, which is approximately 50 miles per gallon across the fleet of vehicles they produce by the year 2025, with certain milestones to be met in interim periods. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have proposed rolling back the fuel economy goal under the CAFE standards to average fuel economy requirements that would be closer to 37 miles per gallon across the fleet of vehicles they produce by the year 2025. However, California and other states continue to maintain the more stringent emissions standards, and the EPA’s Science Advisory Board and certain auto makers have expressed differing preferences for approaches to regulation aimed at improving fuel efficiencies. As a result, our automotive customers continue to explore various avenues for achieving the standards, including lightweighting components and developing more fuel-efficient engines. Lightweighting efforts include the use of alternatives to traditional carbon steels, such as AHSS and other materials. While this could reduce the aggregate volume of steel consumed by the automotive industry, we expect that demand will increase for current and next-generation AHSS and that our AHSS and other innovative steels will command higher margins. We are collaborating with our automotive customers and their suppliers to develop innovative solutions using our developments in lightweighting, efficiency, and material strength and formability across our extensive product portfolio, in combination with our automotive stamping and tube-making capabilities. We are also working with our customers to develop steels with greater heat resistance for exhaust systems that support new, fuel-efficient engines that run at higher temperatures.
Among our innovative solutions for automotive customers are our press-hardenable steel (“PHS”) products for hot-stamping applications. Our ULTRALUME® PHS is an aluminized Type 1 heat-treatable boron steel. Our customers depend on ULTRALUME PHS when they require high-strength parts with complex geometries. These steels enable automotive manufacturers to reduce vehicle weight while continuing to keep pace with critical safety requirements. In October 2019, we entered a licensing agreement with ArcelorMittal that provides us, as the sole North American licensee, the right to have ULTRALUME PHS hot-stamped parts manufactured by both us and our customers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. This licensing agreement resolves a long-standing dispute regarding alleged patent infringement, and we believe that it will result in expanded adoption of this product going forward and growth in our sales over the next several years.
Automotive manufacturers have also been increasing their development of hybrid/electric vehicles (“H/EVs”) in order to meet the CAFE standards and growing customer adoption of H/EVs. Many motors used in H/EVs being sold in the U.S. today are imported from foreign suppliers, but more local sourcing and manufacturing of motors is expected to occur in the future. As the only North American producer of high-efficiency non-oriented electrical steel (“NOES”), which is a critical component of H/EV motors, we are positioned to potentially benefit from the growth of H/EVs going forward. We believe our strong foundation in electrical steels and long-standing relationships with automotive manufacturers and their suppliers will provide us with an advantage in this market as it 
- 2-



continues to grow and mature. Likewise, the growing customer adoption of H/EVs may also increase demand for improvements in the electric grid to support higher demand for more extensive battery charging, which our grain-oriented electrical steels (“GOES”) could support.
Infrastructure and Manufacturing Market
The infrastructure and manufacturing market primarily represents sales to manufacturers of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, appliances, and power transmission and distribution transformers, who produce equipment for the electrical grid. Domestic construction activity and the replacement of aging infrastructure directly affects sales of our carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, particularly for GOES. In 2019, housing starts in the U.S. increased slightly from the prior year, and our domestic GOES customers continue to experience steady demand consistent with the construction and electrical transformer replacement markets. We also believe that the market growth of H/EVs may require upgrades to the U.S. electrical grid infrastructure to support increased demand for electricity, and thus increased demand for our GOES products in the coming years.
Over the past couple of years, electrical steel pricing declined substantially in many international markets, which contributed to GOES imports into the U.S. doubling in the first quarter of 2018 from 2017 before declining since that point. We believe that foreign competitors are continuing to circumvent existing trade laws, primarily by increasing imports of downstream electrical products not currently covered by the Section 232 steel tariff, which include electrical transformer cores and core assemblies, electrical transformers, and even laminations, which are simply cut pieces of electrical steel. To avoid the Section 232 steel tariff, producers have either increased their imports of foreign-made downstream electrical goods or moved some of their domestic production outside the United States, which adversely affects our electrical steel business. These actions have suppressed domestic electrical steel pricing through 2018 and 2019. In the absence of a remedy against these actions to circumvent the Section 232 steel tariff on electrical steel, these actions are likely to continue and increase over time, significantly pressuring our electrical steel business. We continue to work proactively to mitigate or eliminate this potential avenue for avoiding and circumventing the steel tariff, including by communicating our concerns to the U.S. government and requesting appropriate action to address this issue.
Distributors and Converters Market
Steel distributors and converters typically source from the commodity carbon, stainless and electrical spot markets. Demand and pricing can be highly dependent on a variety of factors outside our control, including global and domestic commodity steel production capacity, the relative health of countries’ economies and whether they are consuming or exporting excess steel capacity, the provisions of international trade agreements and fluctuations in international currencies and, therefore, are subject to a high degree of volatility. Because of this volatility and our strategy to focus on value-added products, we have taken deliberate actions to reduce our exposure to these commodity markets.
Geographic Presence
We sell our carbon steel products principally to customers in North America, and we sell our electrical and stainless steel products primarily in North America and Europe. Our customer base is geographically diverse and there is no single country outside the U.S. where our sales are material compared to our total net sales. For the vast majority of international sales, we are not the importer of record and do not bear the responsibility for paying any applicable tariffs.
Research, Innovation and Operations
Rapidly evolving and highly competitive markets require our customers to seek new, comprehensive steel solutions, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver the most robust solutions through our broad portfolio of offerings. In addition to our flat-rolled steels, this includes carbon and stainless tubular products, sophisticated tool and die designs, and lightweight, complex, hard-to-manufacture components and assemblies for the automotive market. Collaboration across our steel, tube-making, stamping and materials research groups generates innovative and comprehensive solutions for our customers, which we believe enhances our competitive advantage.
Creating innovative products and breakthrough solutions is a strategic priority, as we believe differentiation through producing higher value steels to meet challenging requirements enables us to maintain and enhance our margins. We conduct a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and processes and developing new ones. Our tradition of steel innovation has produced a highly diversified flat-rolled steel product portfolio. As part of our underlying strategy to focus on higher-value materials and minimize exposure to commodity products, we have invested in research and innovation totaling $30.7, $29.4 and $28.1 in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Our on-going efforts at our state-of-the-art Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio, to enhance technical collaboration have increased the introduction of new steel solutions to the marketplace.

Research and Innovation Awards
The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy under the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) continues to grant AK Steel awards for innovative steel research. In March 2019, we received an award to leverage high performance computing from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct hot rolling research. Researchers from AK Steel are working in collaboration with scientists from the Computational Engineering Division to build a “Fast Acting Reduced Ordered Model” to predict the properties of a finished steel coil after hot rolling in order to improve product consistency, provide immediate feedback on product quality, and to save time, money and energy by reducing the need for expensive industrial trials. This research also will complement current artificial intelligence models used in the manufacture of AK Steel’s portfolio of innovative steel products.
We are currently in the second year of a three-year project that was announced in October 2018, when the DOE selected us to receive an award of up to $1.2 under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office program to investigate novel low-density steels. The project is being conducted in collaboration with the DOE, Oak Ridge National Laboratory Materials Science and Technology Division, and the Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center at the Colorado School of Mines. The objective of the project is to conduct alloy design, laboratory validation, and testing of low-density steels that are alternatives to currently available advanced high strength steels and other lightweight metals. These low-density steels are expected to generate energy savings by bringing efficiencies in manufacturing and lifetime savings in automotive structural applications. We have begun mathematical modeling and laboratory scale investigations for the program.
We are also in the third year of a project that the DOE awarded to us in May 2017 to develop the next generation of advanced NOES for motors used in a wide variety of industrial and automotive applications. Laboratory proof of concept for this project has been successfully completed and industrial scale trials have been conducted.
These three awards underscore our track record of innovation and our commitment to being a leader in next generation steel product and process development.
In November 2019, the Auto/Steel Partnership recognized members of AK Steel’s Advanced Engineering team as part of the partnership’s 2019 Excellence Awards. The partnership is an automotive material consortium comprised of North American automotive original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) companies and steel producers from the American Iron and Steel Institute’s Automotive Applications Council who leverage shared research in a pre-competitive environment. Project teams within the partnership conduct studies in vehicle design applications using steel. Along with other award recipients, we were recognized for collaboration and technical expertise in finding solutions to industry problems. This included the use of new stamping technologies to facilitate potential applications of Next-Generation AHSS in future automotive body structures. AK Steel received an award in the Individual Category for providing exceptional leadership to the partnership. In addition, AK Steel’s Advanced Engineering group and other members of the partnership Stamping Team were recognized for excellence in the Project Team category. 
Carbon Steel 
We direct most of our research and innovation efforts on carbon steel towards applications for automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. We are particularly focused on AHSS for the automotive market, and we produce virtually every AHSS grade currently used by our customers. Our AHSS grades, such as Dual Phase 590, 780 and 980, have been adopted by our customers for both stamped and roll-formed parts, and our NEXMET® 1000 and 1200 products have demonstrated enhanced strength, formability and opportunities for automotive lightweighting in cold-stamped applications. We are also pursuing application of NEXMET 440EX and NEXMET 490EX in surface-critical, exposed auto body panels as an alternative to aluminum. 
Third-Generation Advanced High-Strength Steel
Our third generation NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS products enable our customers to achieve significant lightweighting in the unexposed structural components of their vehicles. NEXMET 1200, for example, offers superior formability similar to conventional Dual Phase 600 steel, but at twice the strength level. We have expanded the application of the NEXMET technology to our tubular products from AK Tube LLC (“AK Tube”) and stamped components from PPHC Holdings, LLC (“Precision Partners”). These AHSS products allow automotive engineers to design lightweight parts that meet rigorous service and safety requirements. The NEXMET family of steels helps our customers achieve vehicle weight savings for ambitious fuel efficiency standards while avoiding significant capital costs required to re-design production facilities to use alternative materials.
Both galvanized and cold-rolled NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS are progressing through product qualification with several OEM customers, and the first automotive production parts manufactured from NEXMET material will appear on a new vehicle platform that is planned to launch in late 2020. A number of stamping and component assembly trials have been completed successfully, with more planned and underway. Because the timing of automotive design and production cycles spans several years, widespread automotive customer adoption of revolutionary new material such as NEXMET AHSS may also extend over several years.

We expect that other automotive vehicle platforms will incorporate NEXMET AHSS in their designs and that NEXMET AHSS will become a strong differentiator for AK Steel going forward.
Specialty Stainless and Electrical Steel
We continue to develop new and improved specialty stainless and electrical steels for a variety of applications in the automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, and other markets. For example, we are working with our automotive customers and their exhaust system suppliers to develop new stainless steels for exhaust systems that can withstand higher exhaust gas temperatures associated with future engine designs to achieve increased fuel economy. These steels exhibit improved resistance to thermal fatigue and corrosion over currently available materials. We are also developing stainless steels with unique cosmetic appearances (specialized finishes and colors) for use in architectural and appliance applications.
We are a global leader in producing the highest-quality electrical steel products, which are iron-silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties, and our electrical steels are among the most energy efficient in the world. We sell GOES primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers and NOES to manufacturers of electric motors and generators in both the infrastructure and manufacturing and automotive market. Our GOES customers require high-quality steels with low core losses and high magnetic permeability for the production of efficient electrical transformers, which help to lower costs of electricity generation, transmission and distribution. Although we produce both GOES and NOES products, our primary focus remains on the higher-efficiency GOES products, as these are more challenging to produce and typically command higher selling prices and margins than NOES products.
Downstream Steel Applications
Our portfolio of steel solutions includes the operations of Precision Partners, which provides advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot- and cold-stamped components and complex assemblies for the automotive market. In addition to Precision Partners, our downstream operations include AK Tube, which manufactures advanced tubular products for automotive and other applications using carbon and stainless steels, and Combined Metals of Chicago, LLC, a premier processor and distributor of flat-rolled stainless steel products. We believe that collaboration among our steelmaking operations and our downstream businesses can accelerate the adoption of our innovative steel products by automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers.
Our research and technical experts, along with engineers from Precision Partners and AK Tube, have undertaken numerous collaborative projects that are generating robust solutions for our customers. Precision Partners’ expertise in tool design and stamping capabilities has allowed us to create prototype components using AK Steel’s innovative new materials and present customers with new potential steel solutions. This approach has and will continue to demonstrate to customers that they can significantly lightweight automotive parts on an accelerated timeline and in a cost-effective manner by using our highly formable grades of AHSS in place of traditional material types.
In addition, our collaborative projects are enhancing our collective knowledge and experience in the stamping of new, advanced grades of steel, advanced-engineered solutions, and tool design and build. For example, Precision Partners specializes in hot-stamping PHS for automotive applications. AK Steel’s experience as a leader in PHS and Precision Partners’ expertise in hot-stamping has enabled these teams to have greater insight into these high-growth areas and has accelerated product development and customer adoption of these automotive lightweighting solutions. Likewise, collaboration with AK Tube strategically advances our mission to innovate in AHSS for the automotive industry, as AK Tube has been at the forefront of producing tubular products from third-generation AHSS. We believe the combination of Precision Partners’ stamping and advanced die-making capabilities, AK Tube’s leading tubemaking capabilities and AK Steel’s breakthrough material introductions will enhance our ability to deliver innovative, steel solutions to our customers.
Precision Partners has recently been awarded contracts from two major automotive manufacturers to supply single-piece hot-stamped door rings and complex assemblies. Taken together, the awards are expected to represent approximately $50.0 of projected annual stamping and assembly revenue beginning in late 2020 or early 2021, in addition to revenue from a large, one-time tooling award. In winning these contracts, Precision Partners has been able to leverage its hot-stamping tooling leadership, in addition to its innovative hot-stamping process, to capture new strategic opportunities and demonstrate that it is one of the few companies in North America that has the technical capabilities to produce a major complex assembly and stamping work of this nature.
Sustainability
We are committed to operating in a sustainable manner. Beyond ensuring that we are acting responsibly to serve our communities and the environment, sustainably operating our company also opens opportunities to grow our business, increase customer collaboration and loyalty, differentiate us from our competition, and attract, retain and motivate employees. Steel is the most recycled material on 
- 5-



the planet—more than aluminum, plastic, paper and glass combined each year—which establishes a strong foundation for our sustainability initiatives.
In December 2019, AK Steel was named to Newsweek’s “America’s Most Responsible Companies 2020” list. Newsweek published its first ranking of 300 companies from more than 2,000 of the largest U.S. public companies by revenue to determine “which firms were tops when it comes to doing good.” This list focused on performance in the environmental, social and corporate governance areas. AK Steel was the only integrated steel mill included in the Newsweek 2020 list. 
In April 2019, we issued our Sustainability Report for 2018 that highlights our corporate-wide sustainability efforts and our efforts to support our employees, encourage diversity and inclusion, contribute to our communities, and demonstrate our commitment to the environment, among other initiatives. We also disclose our steelmaking operations’ energy and water usage, air emissions, waste generation and targets for reducing our environmental footprint. In addition, our Sustainability Report includes our scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, which are generally direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, and reduction targets for those emissions. Our Sustainability Report (which is not incorporated into this Annual Report) can be found in the “Corporate Citizenship” section of our website at www.aksteel.com.
Employee Safety
Our employees and their safety are of paramount importance to us. Our occupational health and safety policies and programs are the cornerstone of our operating philosophy and are integrated into all of our daily operations and activities. We rigorously manage, control and focus on eliminating or minimizing potential exposure to the hazards associated with making and working around steel. Our low recordable injury rate, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. In 2019, one of our facilities operated with zero OSHA DART (days away, restricted, or job transfer) injuries for the entire year. During the fourth quarter of 2019, three of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries, while six facilities operated with zero OSHA DART injuries. Our full-year 2019 performance at our steelmaking facilities, measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 0.46, which was nearly three times better than the industry average (year-to-date through the third quarter, which is the latest industry information currently available).
We consistently lead the U.S. steel industry in safety, outperforming the steel industry average injury frequencies for each of the last ten years, and we have received numerous awards recognizing our safety performance. In May 2019, AK Steel’s Middletown Works received the Max Eward Safety Award for 2018 from the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute (“ACCCI”), a leading industry trade organization. The award recognizes Middletown Works for operating one of the safest cokemaking facilities in America and operating all of 2018 without a single OSHA recordable injury. This ACCCI recognition marks the 18th time in the last 22 years that one or more AK Steel coke plants have received the Max Eward Safety Award. In May 2019, our Coshocton Works and Zanesville Works were recognized for outstanding safety performance by the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, Division of Safety and Hygiene. We continue to focus on safety in all we do, driving safety results that lead our industry.
Environmental Responsibility
We maintain an unwavering commitment to responsible environmental performance throughout our operations. In 2019, we experienced another year of outstanding overall environmental performance. In addition, to emphasize and reinforce the importance of sustainability and environmental responsibility at the company and to continue to drive improved performance in these areas, since January 2018 our Board of Directors has incorporated an environmental performance component into our annual management incentive plan. After assessing a variety of potential performance categories to incorporate, including an evaluation of areas most ripe for improvement, the Board chose to include air permit deviation events as a category for measuring performance under our annual management incentive plan for 2018 and again in 2019. An air permit deviation event occurs when an event at our steelmaking operations results in noncompliance under the Title V air permits that govern those facilities. In 2019, we had our best performance in the past six years in terms of air permit deviation events, recording our lowest annual total during that period.
We believe that our strong environmental performance is a direct result of the proactive approach we take to environmental management and the close collaborative efforts that we employ across the company. We target sustainable performance in all aspects of our operations, including continuous improvement in operations that include air, water and waste management. Our comprehensive environmental policy provides that we will:

• | commit the necessary resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, permits and agreements applicable to us;


• | reduce environmental risks through operating practices and emergency preparedness programs;


• | encourage recycling, recovery and reuse of residual materials, as well as the reduction and prevention of emissions and releases when feasible;


• | participate in efforts to develop and implement environmental laws and regulations;

- 6-




• | continually evaluate compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; and


• | strive to continually improve the effectiveness of our environmental management efforts.

Certain production units in our operations are inherently water-intensive. However, we continuously seek opportunities to reduce water usage and increase water reuse at our steelmaking plants. In addition, our steelmaking facilities are located near abundant sources of water and we do not believe that any of those operations are located in regions that experience high water stress.
The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) has certified all of our steelmaking plants with ISO 14001 environmental management certification, and our environmental affairs professionals oversee environmental compliance throughout our organization. We also invest heavily in equipment to help meet our environmental objectives. For example, in 2019, we spent $141.3 to operate and maintain our environmental controls and invested $23.0 in environmental projects. During 2019, we completed a $6.0 project at our Rockport Works to install a more modern, environmentally friendly and lower-cost pickling process.
Strategic Opportunities Related to Climate Change
Our strategy of creating new innovative steel solutions and improving existing products enables us to contribute to carbon reduction efforts and the achievement of sustainability goals throughout the product supply chain. Innovative products in each of the carbon, stainless, electrical, tubular, and stamped steel component families further the sustainability goals of many of our customers. For example, in the automotive market our customers are benefiting from our carbon lightweighting solutions to meet their heightened fuel economy targets under the CAFE standards. We are also providing customers with stainless steel and tubular solutions that allow for greater heat resistance in vehicle exhaust systems, enabling exhaust systems to handle the higher engine exhaust temperatures needed for increased fuel economy. In addition, we continue to develop higher-efficiency NOES products for use in future H/EVs and GOES products for their required infrastructure, a market that we anticipate will grow over time. Our steels also contribute to sustainability goals beyond the automotive market. For instance, our GOES products are among the highest-efficiency electrical steels in the world. These GOES products provide low core loss and high magnetic permeability to transmit electricity across electrical grids in the U.S. and around the world more efficiently through better-performing electrical transformers.
While greenhouse gas emissions are a natural byproduct of steel manufacturing today, we continue to take steps to increase energy efficiency while remaining competitive in the global steel marketplace. For example, through the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), we participate in the DOE’s Climate VISION agreement. This program assists domestic steelmakers in their continued efforts to lead the global steel sector in voluntary emissions reductions. We are also a member of the federal ENERGY STAR program, which identifies and promotes energy-efficient products to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ENERGY STAR is a joint program of the EPA and the DOE, helping businesses and consumers save money and protect the environment through energy-efficient products and practices. As with other companies engaged in the production of steel, certain aspects of our production process are carbon-intensive and current technology does not currently afford us the ability to dramatically lower our direct greenhouse gas emissions without significantly reducing the scope of our operations. However, we and other steel producers in the United States are actively participating in research and development to develop technology, processes and approaches to reduce emissions during the steelmaking processes, but these developments are likely to occur over the longer term.
In addition, the production phase of steelmaking is less carbon-intensive than the processes for producing certain other competing materials, such as aluminum. Thus, while the CAFE standards have motivated the use of alternative materials in some vehicles to help achieve lightweighting goals, we intend to continue to educate governments, the automotive industry and other key stakeholders that steel is the most sustainable metal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire life cycle of a vehicle. These benefits are made even greater when utilizing our advanced steel products for vehicle lightweighting.
Our Sustainability Report issued in April 2019 includes targeted emissions reductions and an inventory of our scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions at our steelmaking plants, along with time-bound, quantitative targets for reducing scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions at those plants. Over time, we also plan to expand our efforts to scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, which generally are indirect emissions from purchased energy sources, as we develop our internal systems for tracking and targeting scope 1 greenhouse gas reductions.
Production Resources
Employees
Approximately 5,600 of our 9,300 employees are represented by labor unions. The labor contracts covering these represented employees expire between 2020 and 2023. See the discussion under Labor Agreements in Item 7 for additional information on these agreements.

Raw Materials and Other Inputs
Our steel manufacturing operations require carbon and stainless steel scrap, coal, coke, chrome, iron ore, nickel and zinc as primary raw materials. We also consume natural gas, electricity, graphite electrodes and industrial gases. We make most of our purchases of iron ore, coke, industrial gases and a portion of our electricity at negotiated prices under annual or multi-year agreements with periodic price adjustments. We purchase substantially all of our iron ore from Cliffs under multi-year contracts. We typically purchase most of our metallurgical coal under annual fixed-price agreements, but we also obtain approximately 15% of our metallurgical coal needs from our own mine at AK Coal Resources, Inc. (“AK Coal”). We typically purchase carbon and stainless steel scrap, natural gas, a substantial portion of our electricity and most other raw materials at prevailing market prices, which may fluctuate with market supply and demand. Additionally, we may hedge portions of our energy and raw materials purchases to reduce volatility and risk, which is discussed in more detail in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A.
We also attempt to reduce the risk of future supply shortages and price volatility in other ways. If multi-year contracts are available in the marketplace, we may use these contracts to secure sufficient supply to satisfy our key raw material needs. When multi-year contracts are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we purchase the remainder of our raw materials needs under annual contracts or conduct spot purchases. We also regularly evaluate alternative sources and substitute materials. We believe that we have secured, or will be able to secure, adequate supply sources for our raw materials and energy requirements for 2020.
Competition
We principally compete with domestic and foreign producers of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel, carbon and stainless tubular products, aluminum, carbon fiber, concrete and other materials that may be used as a substitute for flat-rolled steels in manufactured products. Precision Partners and AK Tube both compete against other niche companies in highly fragmented markets.
Price, quality, on-time delivery, customer service and product innovation are the primary competitive factors in the steel industry and vary in importance according to the product category and customer requirements. Steel producers that sell to the automotive market face competition from aluminum manufacturers (and, to a lesser extent, other materials) as automotive manufacturers attempt to develop vehicles that will enable them to satisfy more stringent, government-imposed fuel efficiency standards. To address automotive manufacturers’ lightweighting needs that the aluminum industry is targeting, we and others in the steel industry are developing AHSS grades that we believe provide weight savings similar to aluminum, while being stronger, less costly, more sustainable, easier to repair and more environmentally friendly. Aluminum penetration has been primarily limited to specific automotive applications, such as outer panels and closures, rather than entire body designs. In addition, our automotive customers who continue to use steel, as opposed to aluminum and other alternative materials, are able to avoid the significant capital expenditures required to re-tool their manufacturing processes to accommodate the use of non-steel materials.
Mini-mills (producers using electric arc furnaces) typically have competitive cost advantages as a result of their different production processes and lower labor costs associated with what are often non-union workforces. Their primary raw materials are scrap metal and increasingly pig iron, which blast furnaces produce. Mini-mills generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills, but the increasing use of pig iron, direct reduced iron and compacted hot briquetted iron have enabled them to expand their product capabilities in recent years. However, mini-mills do not have the equipment capabilities to produce the product range that we offer, nor do they possess our depth of customer service, technical support and research and innovation. Recent new or restarted steelmaking capacity in mini-mills has been primarily intended to service markets other than automotive, thus capping negative impacts to our revenues.
Domestic steel producers, including us, face significant competition from foreign producers. For many reasons, these foreign producers often are able to sell products in the U.S. at prices substantially lower than domestic producers. Depending on the country of origin, these reasons may include government subsidies; lower labor, raw material, energy and regulatory costs; less stringent environmental regulations; less stringent safety requirements; the maintenance of artificially low exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; and preferential trade practices in their home countries. Since late 2017, import levels of carbon and stainless flat-rolled products into the United States have shown a gradual and steady decline and have recently been more reflective of historical levels before the unprecedented surges that began in 2014. However, import levels for GOES products are much higher than their historical levels. These may not be in the form of master coils or slit coils, but rather in the form of cut laminations or assembled transformer cores—which are imported under different tariff codes not subject to the current Section 232 tariffs. Import levels are affected to varying degrees by the relative level of steel production in China and other countries, the strength of demand for steel outside the U.S. and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies. Imports of finished steel into the United States accounted for approximately 19%, 23% and 27% of domestic steel market consumption in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
We continue to provide pension and healthcare benefits to a great number of our retirees, resulting in a competitive disadvantage compared to certain other domestic and foreign steel producers that do not provide such benefits to any or most of their retirees. However, we have taken a number of actions to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs, including negotiating

progressive labor agreements that have significantly reduced total employment costs at all of our union-represented facilities, transferring all responsibility for healthcare benefits for various groups of retirees to Voluntary Employee Benefits Association trusts, offering voluntary lump-sum settlements to pension plan participants, lowering retiree benefit costs for salaried employees, and transferring pension obligations to highly rated insurance companies. These actions have not only reduced some of the risks associated with our pension fund obligations, but more importantly have reduced our risk exposure to performance of the financial markets, which are a principal driver of pension funding requirements. We continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs.
