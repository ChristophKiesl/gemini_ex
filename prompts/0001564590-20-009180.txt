 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 
 GENERAL
 Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Virginia corporation and bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, Virginia Commonwealth Bank (the “Bank”) and VCB Financial Group, Inc. (the “Financial Group”). The Bank opened for business in 1930 as Bank of Lancaster and partners with the communities it serves to deliver banking and financial services.
 The Bank is a state-chartered bank, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank has 18 banking offices, including one loan production office, located throughout the greater Richmond region of Virginia, the Northern Neck region of Virginia, Middlesex County, and the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. The Bank serves businesses, professionals, and consumers with a wide variety of financial services, including retail and commercial banking, and mortgage banking. Products include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, cash management accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts, commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, home equity loans, consumer installment loans, insurance, credit cards, online banking, telephone banking, and mobile banking. A substantial amount of the Bank’s deposits are interest bearing, and the majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio is secured by real estate. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) up to applicable limits.
 On April 1, 2017, the Company completed a merger with Virginia BanCorp Inc. (“Virginia BanCorp”), a bank holding company conducting substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary, Virginia Commonwealth Bank. Immediately following the Company’s merger with Virginia BanCorp, Virginia BanCorp’s subsidiary bank was merged with and into Bank of Lancaster (collectively, the “Merger”). Bank of Lancaster then changed its name to Virginia Commonwealth Bank.
 The Financial Group provides management services for personal and corporate trusts, including estate planning, estate settlement, trust administration, and investment and wealth management services. Products and services include estate planning and settlement, revocable and irrevocable living trusts, testamentary trusts, custodial accounts, investment planning, brokerage services, insurance, investment managed accounts, and managed and self-directed individual retirement accounts.
 The Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, Bay Services Company, Inc., a Virginia corporation organized in 1994 (“Bay Services”). Bay Services owns an interest in Infinex Investments, Inc., which provides brokerage services and investment products that are marketed by the Financial Group. 
 The Company had total assets of $1.13 billion, deposits of $910.4 million, and shareholders’ equity of $126.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia, and its telephone number is 804-325-3775. The Company’s website is www.baybanks.com. Information contained on the Company’s website is not a part of or incorporated into this report or any other filing the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 Through the Bank and the Financial Group, the Company provides a wide variety of financial services to its customers in its market areas. The primary products and services provided by the Bank are summarized as follows.

Real Estate Loans The Bank’s mortgage loans on real estate comprise the largest type of its loan portfolio. A large portion of the Bank’s real estate loans are mortgages on one-to-four family residential properties, with both fixed and adjustable interest rate terms, and the majority of these are owner-occupied. Owner-occupied residential mortgages are underwritten and documented within the guidelines of the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). Home equity lines of credit are also offered. The Bank also offers secondary market residential loan origination, whereby home mortgages are underwritten in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) or the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or other secondary market purchasers. These loans are then sold into the secondary market on a loan-by-loan basis, usually directly to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or other secondary market participants. The Bank earns origination fees on sold loans and may retain servicing rights and earn servicing fees from these loans.
 The Bank offers construction, land, and land development loans. These loans are to individuals and qualified builders and are generally for the acquisition or improvement of land and/or the construction and/or improvement of personal residences or commercial properties. Underwritten typically at a maximum of 80% loan to value, funds under these loans are disbursed as construction progresses, subject to verification by Bank inspection. 
 The Bank offers commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing or owner-occupied real estate. These mortgages are typically written at a maximum of 80% loan to value. Commercial mortgages on owner-occupied properties represent real estate loans where the business or business owner occupies all or substantially all of the property and the primary source of repayment is the cash flows from the business occupying the property.
 Commercial and Industrial Loans The Bank offers commercial and industrial loans, which are typically for the financing of equipment and/or inventory or accounts receivable. Commercial and industrial lending includes small business loans, asset based loans, and other secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Commercial and industrial loans may entail greater risk than other loans, and are therefore underwritten with strict risk management standards. Among the criteria for determining the borrower’s ability to repay is a cash flow analysis of the business and business collateral.
 Consumer Loans As part of its range of services, the Bank’s consumer lending services include automobile and boat financing, home improvement loans, credit cards, and unsecured personal loans. These consumer loans historically entail greater risk than loans secured by real estate, but generate a higher rate of return.
 Consumer Deposit Services Consumer deposit products include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. The Bank offers numerous services and access to its customers, including telephone banking, online banking, mobile banking, mobile deposit, electronic statements, and identity theft protection. 
 Commercial Banking Services The Bank offers a variety of services to commercial customers. These services include analysis checking, cash management deposit accounts, wire services, direct deposit payroll service, lockbox service, positive pay, online banking, telephone banking, remote deposit, and a full line of commercial lending options. The Bank also offers Small Business Administration loan products under the 504 Program, which provides long-term funding for commercial real estate and long-lived equipment. This allows commercial customers to obtain favorable rate loans for the development of business opportunities, while providing the Bank with a partial guarantee of the outstanding loan balance.
 Purchased Loans The Bank acquired certain purchased loan pools as part of the Merger. From time to time, the Bank purchases whole or partial loans through various reputable institutions and participations from other banks.
COMPETITION
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and other financial services directly with bank, nonbank institutions, credit unions, Internet-based banks and other financial technology firms, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, insurance companies, and commercial entities that offer financial services products. These entities may be located within or outside the 
 5

Company’s markets. Many of the Company’s competitors have competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a broader scope of services, more favorable pricing, and lower operating costs. The Company believes that its personalized service, competitive pricing, and community involvement enable it to effectively compete in the markets in which it operates.
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 Bank holding companies and banks are highly regulated under both federal and state laws. The following description briefly addresses certain provisions of federal and state laws and certain regulations, proposed regulations, and the potential effects on the Company and the Bank. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals are described in this report, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals.
The Company
 General. As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”), the Company is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Virginia BFI”).
 Permitted Activities. A bank holding company is limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be closely related to banking, managing, or controlling banks. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Possible benefits include greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency. Possible adverse effects include undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity.
 Banking Acquisitions, Changes in Control. The BHCA and related regulations require, among other things, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares), (ii) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, the Federal Reserve will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, any outstanding regulatory compliance issues of any institution that is a party to the transaction, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, the financial condition of each institution that is a party to the transaction and of the combined institution after the transaction, the parties’ managerial resources and risk management and governance processes and systems, the parties’ compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, and the acquiring institution’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws.
 Subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company’s acquiring “control” of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control exists if a person or company acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution and either the institution has registered its securities with the SEC under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) 
 6

or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition. The Company’s common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.
 In addition, Virginia law requires prior approval from the Virginia BFI for (i) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of more than 5% of the voting shares of a Virginia bank or any holding company that controls a Virginia bank, or (ii) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of a bank or its holding company domiciled outside Virginia.
 Source of Strength. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 Safety and Soundness. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution insolvency, receivership, or default. For example, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Company Improvement Act of 1991, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become “undercapitalized” with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to capital management, internal control and information systems, data security, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, risk management, vendor management, corporate governance, asset growth, and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines.
 Capital Requirements. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion, such as the Company, are not subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. Certain capital requirements applicable to the Bank are described below under “The Bank – Capital Requirements.” Subject to capital requirements and certain other restrictions, the Company is able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company.
 7

Limits on Dividends and Other Payments. The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Under current regulations, prior approval from the Federal Reserve is required if cash dividends declared by the Bank in any given year exceed net income for that year plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank and the Company from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their respective businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the current supervisory practices of the Federal Reserve, the Company should inform and consult with its regulators reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the Company’s capital structure.
 Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as the Bank are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if after making such distributions the institution would become “undercapitalized” (as such term is used in the statute). The Company’s non-bank subsidiary, the Financial Group, also may pay dividends to the Company, subject to certain statutory restrictions.
 The Company may receive fees from or pay fees to its affiliated companies for expenses incurred related to certain activities performed by or for the Company for the benefit of its affiliated companies or for its benefit. (An example of such expenses would be independent audit fees paid by the Company.) These fees are charged to/received from each affiliated company based upon various specific allocation methods measuring the estimated usage of such services by that company. The fees are eliminated from reported financial statements in the consolidation process.
 The Bank
 General. The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Federal Reserve and the Virginia BFI. The various laws and regulations administered by the bank regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, incurrence of debt, and the acquisition of financial institutions and other companies. These laws and regulations also affect business practices, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, credit policies, the types of business conducted, and the location of offices. Certain of these laws and regulations are referenced above under “The Company.”
 Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have issued capital adequacy requirements applicable to U.S. banking organizations. Those regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
 Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank became subject to capital rules adopted by federal bank regulators implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules require the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a Total Risked-based Capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a Leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets. The following additional capital requirements related to the “capital conservation buffer” were phased in ratably over a four-year period, beginning on January 1, 2016. As fully phased in effective January 1, 2019, the rules require the Bank to maintain: (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0%, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a minimum Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8.5%, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total Risk-based Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, resulting in a minimum Total Risk-based Capital ratio of 10.5%, and (iv) a minimum Leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary compensation paid to certain officers, based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, ratios of the Bank were in excess of the fully phased-in requirements.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the proposed framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing-in through January 1, 2027. Under the current capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which the standards are implemented by the federal bank regulatory agencies.
 As directed by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), on November 4, 2019, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve jointly issued a final rule that permits qualifying banks that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% “community bank leverage ratio.” Under this rule, which became effective January 1, 2020, a qualifying bank that has chosen the proposed framework would not be required to calculate the existing risk-based and leverage capital requirements and would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” under prompt corrective action rules provided it has a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The Bank qualifies for this election and has not yet determined if it will make such election.
 Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to $250,000 per depositor, per insured depository institution, for each account ownership category.
 The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance pricing is based on CAMELS composite ratings and certain other financial ratios to determine assessment rates for small-established institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk (“CAMELS”). CAMELS composite ratings set a maximum insurance assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks and set minimum assessments for lower rated institutions.
 In March 2016, the FDIC implemented by final rule certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions by raising the DIF’s minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC imposed a 4.5 basis point annual surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The rule granted credits to smaller banks for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The reserve ratio reached 1.35% during the third quarter of 2018, and during 2019, the Bank received $226 thousand of credits. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded expense of $483 thousand and $719 thousand, respectively, for FDIC insurance premiums.
 All FDIC insured institutions were required to pay assessments to the FDIC at an annual rate of approximately one basis point of insured deposits to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments ceased during 2019 due to the maturity of the bonds in 2019.
 Transactions with Affiliates. Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or “affiliates” or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates.
 Loans to executive officers, directors, or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank (“10% Shareholders”) are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act, relating to the prohibition on personal loans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act). Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially 
 9

the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals, and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire board of directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act identifies limited circumstances in which a bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers.
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. The final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital framework also incorporated new requirements into the prompt corrective action framework. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the capital level requirements, referenced above in “capital requirements”, in order to qualify as “well capitalized”. “Well capitalized” institutions may generally operate without additional supervisory restriction. With respect to “adequately capitalized” institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized; they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person, if after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and they cannot accept, renew, or rollover any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.
 Immediately upon becoming “undercapitalized,” a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. The Bank met the definition of being “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
 Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”). The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of the local communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting such credit needs. Furthermore, such assessment is also required of banks that have applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company is subject to assessment in considering the application. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” The Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination.
 Privacy Legislation. Several laws, including the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and related regulations issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies, provide protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions. A financial institution must provide its customers information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers’ personal information. Each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer’s personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice to and approval from the customer.
 10

Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies, procedures, and practices to prevent and deter money laundering, mandates that every bank have a written, board-approved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. The program must, at a minimum: (i) provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance; (ii) provide for independent testing for compliance; (iii) designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (iv) provide training for appropriate personnel. In addition, banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury Department. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, requires bank regulators to consider a financial institution’s compliance with the BSA when reviewing applications from a financial institution. In May 2016, the regulations implementing the BSA were amended to explicitly include risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, to include understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile. In addition, banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers (other than those that are excluded) at the time a new account is opened (other than accounts that are exempted). The Bank was required to comply with these amendments and new requirements beginning May 11, 2018.
 Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against specified foreign parties, including countries and regimes, foreign individuals, and other foreign organizations and entities. OFAC publishes lists of prohibited parties that must be regularly consulted by the banks in the conduct of their business in order to assure compliance. The Bank is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, prohibited parties identified by OFAC, avoiding unlicensed trade and financial transactions with such parties and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with OFAC requirements could have serious legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the Bank.
 Consumer Financial Protection. The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. If the Bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or being prohibited from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
 The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. The CFPB is responsible for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets. While the Bank, like all banks, is subject to federal consumer protection rules enacted by the CFPB, because the Company and the Bank have total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less, the Federal Reserve oversees most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws and regulations applicable to the Bank.
 11

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. Further regulatory positions taken by the CFPB may influence how other regulatory agencies may apply the subject consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
 Cybersecurity. In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company or the Bank fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. To date, neither the Company nor the Bank has experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss, or material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but its systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that the Company or the Bank could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by the Company and the Bank and its customers.
 Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of financial institutions, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the financial institution’s board of directors.
 The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness, and the financial institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. At December 31, 2019, the Company and the Bank have not been made aware of any instances of noncompliance with this guidance.
 Regulatory Reform 
 In May 2018, the Economic Growth Act was enacted to modify or remove certain regulatory financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank, and for

large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Among other matters, the Economic Growth Act expands the definition of qualified mortgages, which may be held by a financial institution with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, exempts community banks from the Volcker Rule, and includes additional regulatory relief regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
 
In addition, the Economic Growth Act simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, as discussed under “The Bank—Capital Requirements.”  
 
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 The Company’s operations are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant effect on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments, and deposits, and they affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had significant effects on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Bank, in the past and are expected to do so in the future. New appointments to the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth.
Future Legislation and Regulation
 Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or effect of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could affect the regulatory structure under which the Company and the Bank operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to business strategies, and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and the Bank.
