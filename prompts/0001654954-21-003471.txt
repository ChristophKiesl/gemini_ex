  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
  
  Business Overview
  
 Support.com, Inc. (“Support.com,” the “Company,” “We” or “Our”) provides customer and technical support solutions delivered by home-based employees. Our homesourcing model, which enables outsourced work to be delivered by people working from home, has been specifically designed for remote work, with attention to security, recruiting, training, delivery, and employee engagement.
 Customer Support Solutions
  
 We provide outsourced customer support and cloud-based technology platforms to companies in multiple industry verticals. We serve clients in verticals such as media and communication, healthcare, retail, and technology with omnichannel programs that include voice, chat, and self-service. We meet clients’ needs through our network of home-based employees and cloud-based platforms. With our fully distributed team, we are able to flex staffing levels and skill sets to address client requirements, offering business process continuity. We custom-profile customer support professionals (called “experts”) who meet the requirements for the work-from-home environment and for specific client criteria related to industry experience, and skill set.
 Technical Support Programs
  
 We offer technical support programs to our enterprise clients that are sold to the clients’ end customers. These tailored programs can be bundled with complementary services or offered on stand-alone basis as a subscription or one-time purchase.
  
 We also offer a subscription-based tech support service direct-to-consumers and small businesses that helps users solve a wide-range of technology problems with all computers, smartphones, and other connected devices, including device setup, troubleshooting, connectivity or interoperability problems, and malware and virus removal.
  
  End-User Software
  
 Our SUPERAntiSpyware® software is a malware protection and removal software product available for the Windows OS on personal computers and tablets. The software is licensed on an annual basis, and is sold direct to consumers and businesses, or through re-sellers.
  
  Sales and Marketing
  
  Customer Support Solutions
  
 We sell our customer support solutions through a dedicated sales force with a consultative approach. We market these solutions to clients in a number of verticals, including media and communication, healthcare, retail and technology. Our direct sales efforts occur in response to our lead generation program, a request for proposal, a reference from an existing client, or otherwise. The sales cycle varies depending upon the type of client, the type of services, and the existence of an established relationship.
  
 We also license Support.com’s technology platform and/or applications separately from our outsourced customer support services. In such an arrangement, customers receive the right to use our cloud-based software in their own support organization, using a SaaS model under which customers pay us on a per-user or a per-session basis during the term of the arrangement. We also provide implementation services to customers, typically covering integration of our software with other customers’ systems.

    Technical Support Programs
  
 We sell tech support subscription services and fully managed technical support programs to clients through our direct sales efforts. Typical clients may include communication providers (MSOs/ISPs), retailers, or OEMs, among others. Our clients may bundle our subscription-based tech support services with existing complementary services or offer them on a stand-alone basis to their end customers. Our tech support subscription services may be offered under the client’s brand (white-labeled) or co-branded.
  
 We also sell our tech support services direct to consumers and small businesses primarily through online marketing channels, including but not limited to search engine optimization (SEO), paid and earned social media, and content marketing.
  
  End-User Software Product
  
 We license SUPERAntiSpyware® directly to clients and through re-sellers or partners. To date, a majority of the end-user software revenue has come through direct sales to clients. A substantial percentage of SUPERAntiSpyware® software revenue arises from customers who download free trial versions of the software or free versions of the software with limited functionality before making a purchase decision.
  
  Engineering and IT
  
 Engineering and IT expense was $3.7 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
  
 We maintain dedicated engineering and IT teams to develop, maintain, and continue to improve proprietary, cloud-based technologies that are essential to our business. We focus our investment in engineering and IT across the following major areas: the creation and refinement of our Guided Paths® software and library; solutions for support interaction optimization; endpoint applications and other extensions to gather data to assist support interactions and allow remote support when necessary; business analytics and reporting; open application interfaces; and internal service delivery management tools.
  
 Guided Paths® contains step-by-step self-support guides, with decision points along the way to help customers resolve problems. Our experts also leverage Guided Paths as instructional guides and knowledge base as part of customer support.
  
 The service delivery management tools used by our experts for technology support services include our own Support.com cloud-based software capabilities and other contact center applications such as customer relationship management (“CRM”), ticketing, ordering, methods of payment, and telephony, which are all integrated into applications for our contact center specialists. The tools support all omnichannel services to include voice, email, chat, SMS and self-service.
  
 For business analytics and reporting, we build and maintain a data warehouse that aggregates and restructures data from all of our applications to create a comprehensive view of the service delivery lifecycle, as well as data about the disposition of support interactions. This data set provides visibility into sales conversion effectiveness, service delivery efficiency, service level performance, subscription utilization, partner program performance and many other aspects of running and optimizing our business. Our partners also receive reports and analytic information from the warehouse for their programs on a regular basis via secure data feeds.
  
 Open application interfaces of our Support.com Cloud enable integration with CRM, ticketing systems, and other contact center applications.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
 We own the trademarks SUPPORT.COM®, GUIDED PATHS®, PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS, BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS and NEXUS® in the United States for specified support services and software, and we have registrations and common law rights for several related trademarks in the U.S. and certain other countries. We own the domain name Support.com and additional other domain names. We have a pending trademark registration for Homesourcing™. We also retain exclusive rights to our proprietary services technology, and our end user software products. In addition, we hold non-exclusive rights to sell and distribute certain other software products.

   We own two U.S. patents related to our business and have a number of pending patent applications covering certain advanced technology. Our issued patents include U.S. Patent No. 8,020,190 (“Enhanced Browser Security”) and U.S. Patent No. 6,754,707 (“Secure Computer Support System”). However, we do not know if our current patent applications or any future patent application will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. Also, we do not know whether any patents we have or may receive will be challenged or invalidated. It is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as they do in the United States, and our competitors may develop technology that competes with ours but nevertheless does not infringe our intellectual property rights.
  
 We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights that are not protected by patents. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants involved in product development. We generally require our employees, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we will disclose any sensitive aspects of our business. Also, we generally require employees and contractors to agree to assign and surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate while working for us in the scope of employment. These precautions, and our efforts to register and protect our intellectual property, may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
  
  Competition
  
 We are active in markets that are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Although we do not believe there is one principal competitor for all aspects of our offerings, we do compete with a number of other vendors.
  
 With regard to our customer support services, our competitors include large multi-national corporations and smaller, regional providers, and may vary by geography. We compete with in-house customer management operations as well as other companies that provide outsourced customer care including: Concentrix, Teleperformance, Sitel, TaskUs, Alorica and 24-7 Intouch, among others. The principal competitive factors include: technological innovation, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, brand, and financial stability.
  
 With respect to licensing of our Support.com technology platform and applications, our competitors include companies focused on service desk, knowledge management, remote support and IT process automation. We believe the principal competitive factors in our technology platform and applications include breadth and depth of functionality, including our remote security and employee monitoring features, ease of implementation, overall performance, scalability, pricing, financial resources, and customer support. We believe that our Support.com technology platform and applications offering provides an integrated solution that covers different areas of functionality required by customers.
  
 With respect to partnerships for our technology support services, our competitors include companies focused on premium technology services, certain warranty providers, emerging Internet of Things (“IoT”) technology support providers, global business process outsourcing providers or contact centers focused on technical support and other companies who offer technical support through partners. We believe the principal competitive factors in our services market include: pricing, breadth and depth of service offerings, quality of the customer experience, proprietary technology, time to market, account management, vendor reputation, scale, and financial resources.
  
 With regard to our direct-to-consumer and small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) technical support services, our competitors include device retailers, multiple system operators (MSOs)/internet service providers (ISPs), and smaller privately-held or local companies in the home installation, computer repair, or general tech support space. We believe the principal competitive factors in our premium tech support market include the breadth of service offering, value-based and flexible pricing, and customer experience and service levels.
  
 In the market for our end-user software product, SUPERAntiSpyware®, we face direct competition from other anti-malware software vendors, anti-virus software vendors, operating system providers and other OEMs that may provide similar solutions and function in their products, and from individuals and groups who offer “free” and open source utilities online. We compete in this market on the basis of our value-based pricing.

   The competitors in our markets for services and software can have some or all of the following competitive advantages: longer operating histories, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, greater engineering and technical resources, greater sales and marketing resources, stronger strategic alliances and distribution channels, larger user bases, products with different functions and feature sets, and greater brand recognition than we have. We expect new competitors to continue to enter the markets in which we operate.
