Item 1. Business.
General
 
RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“RegeneRx” or the “Company”) (OTCQB:RGRX) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a novel therapeutic peptide, Thymosin beta 4, or Tß4, for tissue and organ protection, repair, and regeneration. We have formulated Tß4 into three distinct product candidates in clinical development:
 
• RGN-259, a preservative-free topical eye drop for regeneration of corneal tissues damaged by injury, disease or other pathology;
 
• RGN-352, an injectable formulation to treat cardiovascular diseases, central and peripheral nervous system diseases, and other medical indications that may be treated by systemic administration; and
 
• RGN-137, a topical gel for dermal wounds and reduction of scar tissue.
 
We are continuing strategic partnership discussions with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies regarding the further clinical development of all of our product candidates.
 
In addition to our three pharmaceutical product candidates, we are also evaluating the commercial development of peptide fragments and derivatives of Tß4 for potential cosmeceutical and other personal care uses. These fragments are select amino acid sequences, and variations thereof, within the Tß4 molecule that have demonstrated activity in several in vitro preclinical research studies that we have sponsored. We believe the biological activities of these fragments may be useful, for example, in developing novel cosmeceutical products for the anti-aging market. Our strategy is to collaborate with another company to develop cosmeceutical formulations based on these peptides.
 
Current Clinical Status
 
On January 28, 2015, we announced that we had entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) with GtreeBNT Co., Ltd., a Korean pharmaceutical company (“GtreeBNT”) and shareholder of the Company. The Joint Venture Agreement provides for the creation of an entity, ReGenTree, LLC (the “Joint Venture” or “ReGenTree”), jointly owned by us and GtreeBNT, that will commercialize RGN-259 for treatment of dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy, an orphan indication in the United States. GtreeBNT will be responsible for funding all product development and commercialization efforts, and holds a majority interest of ReGenTree that varies depending on development milestones achieved and eventual commercialization path, if successful. In conjunction with the Joint Venture Agreement, we also entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with ReGenTree pursuant to which we granted to ReGenTree the right to develop and exclusively commercialize RGN-259 in the United States. We received a total of $1 million in two tranches under the terms of the License Agreement. The first tranche of $500,000 was received in March 2015 and a second in the amount of $500,000, was received in September 2015. On April 6, 2016, we received $250,000 from ReGenTree and executed an amendment to the license agreement on April 28, 2016. Under the amendment, the territorial rights were expanded to include Canada. We are also entitled to royalties as a percentage of net sales ranging from the single digits to the low-double digits based on the medical indications approved and whether the Joint Venture commercializes products directly or through a third party. RegeneRx possesses one of three board seats of ReGenTree and certain major decisions and transactions within ReGenTree, such as commercialization strategy, mergers, and acquisitions, require RegeneRx’s board designee’s consent.

Our initial ownership interest in ReGenTree was 49% which was reduced to 42% after filing of the final clinical study report with the FDA for the Phase 2/3 trial for Dry Eye Syndrome completed earlier in 2016. Based on when, and if, ReGenTree achieves certain additional development milestones in the U.S. with RGN-259, our equity ownership may be incrementally reduced to between 42% and 25%, with 25% being the final equity ownership upon FDA approval of an NDA for Dry Eye Syndrome in the U.S. In addition to our equity ownership, RegeneRx retains a royalty on net sales that varies between single and low double digits, depending on whether commercial sales are made by ReGenTree or a licensee. In the event ReGenTree is acquired, or a change of control occurs following achievement of an NDA, RegeneRx shall be entitled to a minimum of 40% of all proceeds paid or payable and will forgo any future royalties.
 
In September 2015, ReGenTree began a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with dry eye syndrome (“DES”) and a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (“NK”), both in the U.S. In May 2016, we reported the results of the 317-patient Phase 2/3 trial. In the trial, RGN-259 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms of dry eye with 0.05% and 0.1% RGN-259 compared to placebo in a dose dependent manner during a 28-day dosing period. While the primary outcome measures were not met, several key related pre-specified endpoints and subgroups of patients with more severe dry eye showed statistically significant treatment effects. These results confirm the findings from the previous Phase 2 trial providing clear direction for the clinical regulatory pathway and remaining registration trials for RGN-259. The FDA approved ReGenTree’s Phase 3 protocol for DES in late summer 2016 and we initiated a second Phase 3 trial that has begun enrolling approximately 500 patients.
 
The NK trial, a smaller study in an orphan population, has enrolled twelve patients thus far, and has several additional patients being screened, with a goal of forty-six. There are currently ten clinical sites for the study, three of which joined in the past three months with several other sites expected in the future. ReGenTree has expanded its efforts to accelerate patient enrollment by offering incentives to each site based on numbers of enrollees as well as payments to referral sites.
 
In February 2017, our licensee for RGN-137, GtreeBNT, received permission from the U.S. FDA to sponsor a Phase 3 clinical trial using RGN-137 to treat patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a genetic disease that causes severe blistering of the skin and internal organs. The Phase 3 trial will be a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RGN-137 topically administered to approximately 200 EB patients at clinical sites throughout the U.S., GtreeBNT will be sponsoring and funding the clinical trial, which is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2017.
 
Currently, we have active partnerships in three major territories: the U.S., China and Pan Asia. Our partners have been moving forward and making progress in each territory. In each case, the cost of development is being borne by our partners with no financial obligation for RegeneRx. We still have significant clinical assets to develop, primarily RGN-352 (injectable formulation of Tß4 for cardiac and CNS disorders) in the U.S., Pan Asia, and Europe, RGN-259 in the EU, and RGN-137, our dermal wound healing gel. Our goal is to wait until the results are obtained from the current ophthalmic clinical trials before moving into the EU with RGN-259. If successful, this should allow us to obtain a higher value for the asset at that time. However, we intend to continue to develop RGN-352, our injectable systemic product candidate for cardiac and central nervous system indications, either by obtaining grants to fund a Phase 2a clinical trial in the cardiovascular or central nervous system fields or finding a suitable partner with the resources and capabilities to develop it as we have with RGN-259.
 
We anticipate incurring additional operating losses in the future as we continue to explore the potential clinical benefits of Tß4-based product candidates over multiple indications. To fund further development and clinical trials we have entered into a series of strategic partnerships under licensing and joint venture agreements (see “Strategic Partnerships” below) where our partners are responsible for advancing development of our product candidates with multiple clinical trials.
 
On June 27, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Sabby Healthcare Master Fund, Ltd., and Sabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund, Ltd. (collectively, “Sabby”) pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 5,147,059 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 5,147,059 shares of common stock, which we refer to as the 2016 Offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $1,520,000 from the offering which was projected to fund our operations at the current level for approximately 6 months beyond this report date. We will need to secure additional operating capital to continue operations beyond the third quarter of 2017. We continuously monitor our cash use as well as the clinical timelines. We will need to secure additional operating capital in 2017 and are evaluating options including the licensing of additional rights to commercialize our clinical products as well as raising capital through the capital markets.
 
Overview of Tß4
 
Tß4 is a synthetic copy of a naturally occurring 43-amino acid peptide that was originally isolated from bovine thymus glands. It plays a vital role in cell structure and motility and in the protection, regeneration, remodeling and healing of tissues.
 
Although it is recognized that wound healing and tissue regeneration are complex processes, most companies working to develop new drugs in this area have focused primarily on the development of growth factors to stimulate healing only and have, to date, failed to demonstrate dramatic improvements in the healing process. Unlike growth factors, numerous preclinical animal studies, published by independent researchers, have identified several important biological activities involving Tß4 that we believe make it potentially useful as a wound healing, repair and tissue regenerating agent. These activities include:

-


· | Progenitor (Stem) Cell Recruitment and Differentiation. Independent research published in the journal Nature in November 2006 featured the discovery that Tß4 is the key signaling molecule that recruits and triggers adult epicardial progenitor cells, or EPCs, to differentiate into coronary blood vessels. EPCs are partially differentiated stem cells that can further differentiate into specific cell types when needed. Confirmatory research published in 2009 in the Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology concluded that Tß4 is responsible for the initiation of the embryonic coronary developmental program and EPC differentiation in adult mice. These publications confirm that Tß4’s interaction with EPCs is necessary for the maintenance of a healthy adult animal heart, as well as for normal embryo and fetal heart development in mammals. In Neuroscience (2009 and 2010), and the J. Neurosurgery (2010), Tß4 was shown to similarly stimulate oligodendrogenesis, i.e., the differentiation of oligodendroctye progenitor cells into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, whereby restoring functional recovery in animal models of multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Actin Regulation. Tß4 regulates actin, which comprises up to 10% of the protein of non-muscle cells in the body and plays a central role in cell structure and in the movement of cells. Independent research studies have indicated that Tß4 stimulates the migration of human keratinocytes, or skin cells, as well as corneal epithelial cells that protect the eye, human endothelial cells and progenitor cells of the heart and brain. Endothelial cells are the major cell type responsible for the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Certain of these studies conducted at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, were the first to suggest the role of Tß4 in wound healing. The data from these studies encouraged us to license the rights to Tß4 from the NIH in 2001 and to launch an initial clinical development program that targeted the use Tß4 for chronic dermal wounds. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduction of Inflammation and scar tissue formation. Uncontrolled inflammation is the underlying basis of many pathologies and injuries. Independent research has shown that Tß4 is a potent anti-inflammatory agent in skin cells and in corneal epithelial cells in the eye. Tß4 has also been shown to decrease the levels of inflammatory mediators and to significantly reduce the influx of inflammatory cells in the reperfused heart of animals. More recent preclinical research suggests that Tß4 blocks activation of the NFκB pathway, which is involved in DNA activation of inflammatory mediators, thereby modulating inflammation in the body. This anti-inflammatory activity may explain, in part, the mechanism by which Tß4 appeared to improve functional outcome in the mouse multiple sclerosis model described above, as well as promoting repair in the heart and skin. In the skin, it has been shown to reduce scar formation by reduction of infiltration of myofibroblasts. Identifying a factor such as Tß4 that reduces scarring and blocks activation of NFκB suggests that Tß4 could have additional important therapeutic applications for inflammation-related diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatic diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory pulmonary disease and pancreatitis.

· | Collagen and Laminin-5 Stimulation. Tß4 has a number of additional biological activities shown to reduce inflammation, stimulate the formation of collagen, and up-regulate the expression of laminin-5, a subepithelial basement membrane protein. Both collagen and laminin-5 are central to healthy tissue, wound repair and the prevention of disease. Laminin-5 promotes cell migration and maintains cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts for intact tissues which are important for preventing fluid loss and bacterial infection. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anti-Apoptosis. Tß4 has been shown to prevent apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in two animal models and in two tissue types. In the rodent model, corneal apoptosis, or loss of corneal epithelial cells leading to corneal epithelial thinning, was prevented through topical administration of Tß4 eye drops. In the heart muscle of ischemic animal models, such as in mice and pigs, cell death was prevented by either local or systemic administration of Tß4. It acts by reducing oxidative enzymes. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Tß4 has shown efficacy in heart repair and regeneration in numerous animal models. A 2004 paper in Nature showed that it could reduce the lesion size, improve cardiac function and promote survival. The 2006 Nature publication mentioned above further concluded that Tß4’s interaction with EPCs resulted in the formation of cardiomyocytes that repaired damaged myocardium, or heart tissue, in mice after an induced acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, commonly known as a heart attack. Research published in the journal Circulation showed Tß4’s cardioprotective effects in a pig ischemic-reperfusion model. This pig model is accepted as an important model upon which to base human clinical research, as pigs are larger mammals, the anatomy of the pig heart is similar to that of the human heart, and vascular response processes are completed five to six times faster in pigs than in humans, so that long-term results can be obtained in a relatively short period of time. This research also identified Tß4’s interaction with EPCs as the underlying basis of cardioprotection through the differentiation of EPCs into cardiomyocytes, yielding statistically significant cardiac functional recovery results when compared to the administration of placebo.

Similar research in the area of brain and central nervous system tissues also showed efficacy of repair and regeneration was published in the journal Neuroscience in 2009. This publication concluded that Tß4 triggered the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to form myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, which led to the remyelination of axons in the brain of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, or EAE. This mouse model is an accepted small animal model for the study of multiple sclerosis. Research published in the Journal of Neurosurgery in 2010 and also in the Journal of Neurological Science in 2014 showed that Tß4 could improve functional neurological outcome in an animal stroke model. A second study was published in the Journal of Neurosurgery in 2011 demonstrating that administration of Tß4 can significantly improve histological and functional outcomes in rats with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, indicating that Tß4 has considerable therapeutic potential for patients with TBI. More recently, researchers studying Tß4 under a material transfer agreement (MTA) found that Tß4 had beneficial effects in animal models of peripheral neuropathy, one of the major complications of diabetes. This research was published in the Journal of Neurobiology of Disease in December 2012 and appears to corroborate previous findings using Tß4 for repair of central nervous system disorders. A paper in Neuropharmacology in 2014 found many benefits of Tß4 administration in a rat model of spinal cord injury, including decreased lesion size at 7 days, increased neural and oligodendrocyte survival, increase levels of myelin basic protein (a marker of mature oligodendrocytes), decreased ED1 (a marker of activated microglia/macrophages), and decreased proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, Tß4 has efficacy for repair and regeneration in several nervous system injury models including MS, TBI, stroke, peripheral neuropathy, and spinal cord injury and there will likely be additional applications in this area. We believe that these various biological activities work in concert to play a vital role in the healing and repair of injured or damaged tissue and suggest that Tß4 is an essential component of the tissue protection and regeneration process that may lead to many potential medical applications. All of our product candidates utilize Tß4 as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which is manufactured by solid-phase peptide synthesis and is an exact copy of the naturally occurring peptide. We have created three distinct formulations for various routes of administration and medical indications.
 
Our Product Candidates
 
RGN-259
 
RGN-259 is our proprietary preservative-free eye drop formulation of Thymosin beta 4. In September 2011, we completed a Phase 2a exploratory clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of RGN-259 in 72 patients with moderate dry eye syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either RGN-259 or placebo in this double-masked, placebo-controlled trial. All patients received either RGN-259 (0.1% concentration) or placebo, twice daily for 30 days. Various signs and symptoms of dry eye, such as the degree of ocular surface damage, ocular itching, burning and grittiness, among others, were graded periodically during and following the treatment period. The trial was conducted by Ora Inc., an ophthalmic contract research organization that specializes in dry eye research and clinical trials, and utilized Ora’s Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE®) chamber, which is a model that exacerbates and standardizes signs and symptoms in the dry eye patient.
 
In November 2011, we reported preliminary safety and efficacy results from the trial. RGN-259 was deemed safe and well-tolerated, with no observed drug-related adverse events.
 
The co-primary outcome measures evaluated in the trial were inferior corneal fluorescein staining and decreased ocular discomfort on day 29, 24 hours after CAE® challenge. Various secondary outcome efficacy measures were also evaluated in the trial. These outcome measures were based on the best available animal data at the time but without the benefit of any actual human clinical experience in dry eye. While the study did not meet statistical significance for reducing inferior corneal fluorescein staining, it did show a positive trend in this exploratory trial. RGN-259 did, however, show a statistically significant efficacy result in the other co-primary endpoint of decreased ocular discomfort and also demonstrated statistical significance in several secondary endpoints such as reduction of central corneal and superior corneal staining, important signs in dry eye patients and approvable endpoints by the FDA.
 
Key outcome measures were as follows:
 

· | Patients receiving RGN-259 experienced a 325% greater reduction from baseline in central corneal fluorescein staining compared to placebo at the 24 hour recovery period (p = 0.0075). Reduction of fluorescein staining is indicative of a reduction in ocular surface damage of the central cornea;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patients receiving RGN-259 experienced a 257% greater reduction from baseline in exacerbation of superior corneal fluorescein staining in the CAE® chamber as compared to the placebo (p = 0.0210); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Patients receiving RGN-259 experienced a 27.3% greater reduction in exacerbation of ocular discomfort at day 28 during a 75-minute challenge in the CAE chamber compared to the placebo group (p = 0.0244). Reduction indicates that RGN-259 can slow progression of ocular symptoms in patients with dry eye syndrome.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Other CAE®-related findings, such as peripheral (combination of the average of superior and inferior) corneal staining reduction, were observed having statistical significance, while others had positive trends after treatment with RGN-259. These observations are in line with the known biological properties and mechanisms of action of RGN-259 reported in various nonclinical studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
With respect to inferior corneal fluorescein staining, we did see a positive trend toward improvement, at day 28 during exposure to adverse conditions in the CAE® chamber in patients receiving RGN-259 compared to placebo, although this improvement was not deemed to be statistically significant (p = 0.0968).
 
In June 2012, we reported preliminary results from a double-masked, vehicle-controlled, physician-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating RGN-259 for the treatment of nine patients (18 eyes) with severe dry eye. RGN-259 was observed to be safe and well-tolerated and met key efficacy objectives with statistically significant sign and symptom improvements, compared to vehicle control, at various time intervals, including 28 days post-treatment.
 
In the trial, nine patients with severe dry eye (18 eyes) were treated with RGN-259 or vehicle control six times daily over a period of 28 days. They were evaluated upon entering the study after a two-week washout period, at weekly intervals during the treatment phase, at the end of the 28-day treatment period, and at a follow-up visit 28 days after treatment. Statistically significant differences in sign and symptom assessments, such as ocular discomfort and corneal fluorescein staining, were seen at various time points throughout the study. Of particular note were the differences between RGN-259 and vehicle control 28 days post-treatment, or the follow-up period. The RGN-259-treated group had a 35.1% reduction of ocular discomfort (symptom) compared to vehicle control (p = 0.0141), and a 59.1% reduction of total corneal fluorescein staining (sign) compared to vehicle control (p = 0.0108) at 28 days after treatment showing that the repair was sustained long after treatment cessation.
 
Consistent with the reduction of ocular discomfort and fluorescein staining at the 28-day follow-up visit, other improvements seen in the RGN-259-treated patients included tear film breakup time and increased tear volume production. Likewise, these improvements were seen at other time points in the study. These results were recently published in an appropriate medical journal.
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
Lee’s Pharmaceuticals. In July 2012, we entered into a License Agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Limited (“Lee’s”), headquartered in Hong Kong, for the license of Thymosin Beta 4 in any pharmaceutical form, including our RGN-259, RGN-352 and RGN-137 product candidates, in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Lee’s previously filed an investigational new drug application IND with the Chinese FDA to conduct a Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, dose-response clinical trial with RGN-259 in China for dry-eye syndrome. Lee's subsequently informed us that it received notice from China's FDA (CFDA) declining its investigational new drug (IND) application for a Phase 2b dry eye clinical trial because the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient or Tß4) was manufactured outside of China. The API was manufactured in the U.S. and provided to Lee's by RegeneRx pursuant to a license agreement to develop RGN-259 ophthalmic eye drops in the licensed territory. However, in mid-2016, we were informed by Lee’s that the CFDA modified its manufacturing regulations and will now allow Chinese companies to utilize API manufactured outside of China for Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. We have not yet been informed of a projected starting date for Phase 2 trials but expect it to be sometime in mid-2017.
 
GtreeBNT. In March 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with GtreeBNT for the license of RGN-259. GtreeBNT licensed certain development and commercialization rights for RGN-259, in Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). Separately, we licensed GtreeBNT the rights to RGN-137 for development in the U.S. where they are sponsoring a Phase 3 clinical trial planned to begin in the third quarter of 2017 in patients with epidermolysis bullolsa (EB). GtreeBNT is currently our second largest shareholder. GtreeBNT filed an IND with the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to conduct a Phase 2/3 study with RGN-259 in patients with dry eye syndrome and in July 2015 received approval to conduct the trial. In late 2016 GtreeBNT informed us that it believes marketing approval in the U.S. will allow expedited marketing in Korea, possibly without the need for a clinical trial.

U.S. Joint Venture (ReGenTree, LLC). On January 28, 2015, we announced that we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) with GtreeBNT. The Joint Venture Agreement provides for the creation of an entity (the “Joint Venture” or “ReGenTree”), owned by us and GtreeBNT, that will commercialize RGN-259 for treatment of dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy in the United States. GtreeBNT is responsible for funding product development and commercialization efforts and holds a majority interest of ReGenTree. RegeneRx possesses one of three board seats and certain major decisions and transactions within ReGenTree, such as commercialization strategy, mergers, and acquisitions, require RegeneRx’s board designee’s consent. In conjunction with the Joint Venture Agreement, we also entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with ReGenTree pursuant to which we granted to ReGenTree the right to develop and exclusively commercialize RGN-259 in the United States. On April 6, 2016 we received $250,000 from ReGenTree and executed an amendment to the license agreement on April 28, 2016. Under the amendment the territorial rights were expanded to include Canada.

Our initial ownership interest in ReGenTree was 49% and has been reduced to 42% after filing of the final clinical study report with the FDA for the Phase 2/3 trial for Dry Eye Syndrome completed earlier in 2016. Based on when, and if, ReGenTree achieves certain additional development milestones in the U.S. with RGN-259, our equity ownership may be incrementally reduced to between 42% and 25%, with 25% being the final equity ownership upon FDA approval of an NDA for Dry Eye Syndrome in the U.S. In addition to our equity ownership, RegeneRx retains a royalty on net sales that varies between single and low double digits, depending on whether commercial sales are made by ReGenTree or a licensee. In the event the ReGenTree entity is acquired or there is a change of control that occurs following achievement of an NDA, RegeneRx shall be entitled to a minimum of 40% of all proceeds paid or payable and will forgo any future royalties.
 
In September 2015, ReGenTree began a multi-centered, randomized, double-masked Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with dry eye syndrome (“DES”) and a multi-centered, randomized, double-masked Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with neurotrophic keratopathy (“NK”), both in the U.S. The DES trial has completed full enrollment, treatment and follow-up of all patients. Data from the DES trial was released in early May 2016. The FDA approved ReGenTree’s Phase 3 protocol for DES in late summer 2016 and we initiated a second Phase 3 trial that has begun enrolling approximately 500 patients.
 
The NK trial, a smaller study in an orphan population, has enrolled twelve patients thus far, and has several additional patients being screened, with a goal of forty-six.
 
In February 2017, our licensee for RGN-137, GtreeBNT, received permission from the U.S. FDA to sponsor a Phase 3 clinical trial using RGN-137 to treat patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a genetic disease that causes severe blistering of the skin and internal organs. The Phase 3 trial will be a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RGN-137 topically administered to approximately 200 EB patients at clinical sites throughout the U.S. GtreeBNT will be sponsoring and funding the clinical trial, which is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2017.
 
GtreeBNT has developed the CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and controls) dossier required for Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization in the U.S. and in Korea. This comprehensive and critical effort ensures that final drug product manufacturing, packaging, stability, purity, reproducibility, etc., meets regulatory guidelines and product specifications. The product of this activity is the current product format being utilized in the U.S. trials being conducted by ReGenTree and will also be utilized in the planned clinical activity to be conducted by GtreeBNT under the RGN-259 license agreement for Pan Asia.
 
RGN-352 
 
During 2009, we completed a Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the intravenous administration of RGN-352 in 60 healthy subjects (40 in each group, 20 of whom participated in both Phases). Based on the results of these Phase 1 trials and extensive preclinical efficacy data published in peer-reviewed journals, in the second half of 2010, we began start-up activities for a Phase 2 study to evaluate RGN-352 (Tß4 Injectable Solution) in patients who had suffered an AMI. We had planned to begin enrolling patients in this clinical trial in the second quarter of 2011. However, in March 2011, we were notified by the FDA that the trial was placed on clinical hold as a result of our contract manufacturer’s alleged failure to comply with the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. We have since learned that the manufacturer has closed its manufacturing facility and filed for bankruptcy protection. The FDA prohibited us from using any of the active drug or placebo formulated by this manufacturer in human trials; consequently, we must have study drug (RGN-352 and RGN-352 placebo) manufactured by a new cGMP-compliant manufacturer in the event we seek to move forward with this trial. While we have identified a qualified manufacturer for RGN-352, we have elected to postpone activities on this trial until the requisite funding or a partner is secured.
 
In addition to the potential application of RGN-352 for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, preclinical research published in the scientific journals Neuroscience and the Journal of Neurosurgery, among others, indicates that RGN-352 may also prove useful for patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as well as patients suffering a stroke, traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, or spinal cord injury. In these preclinical studies, the administration of Tß4 resulted in regeneration of neuronal tissue by promoting remyelination of axons and stimulating oligodendrogenesis, resulting in improvement of neurological functional activity. In 2012, researchers studying Tß4 under a material transfer agreement (MTA) found that Tß4 had beneficial effects in animal models of peripheral neuropathy, one of the major complications of diabetes. This research was published in the journal of Neurobiology of Disease in 2012 and appears to corroborate previous findings using Tß4 for repair of central nervous system disorders. We are discussing possible partnership opportunities with companies interested in developing RGN-352 for this indication.
 
Based on our Phase 1 data and the preclinical research discussed above, we are evaluating various opportunities for government funding for a Phase 2a clinical trial to show proof-of-concept in each case while also talking with prospective strategic partners with the interest, capabilities and resources to further develop product candidate in these fields.

RGN-137
 
Clinical Development — Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).  In 2005, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of RGN-137 for the treatment of patients with EB. EB is a genetic disease of approximately 10 gene mutations that results in fragile skin and other epithelial structures (e.g., cornea and GI tract) that can blister spontaneously or separate at the slightest trauma or friction, creating a wound that at times does not heal or heals poorly. In severe cases, recurrent blistering and tissue loss may be life threatening. EB has been designated as an “orphan” indication by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drugs. A portion of this trial was funded by a grant of $681,000 received from the FDA. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response trial, nine U.S. clinical sites evaluated the safety, tolerability, and wound healing effectiveness of three different concentrations of RGN-137 compared to placebo. RGN-137 was applied topically to the skin, once daily for up to 56 consecutive days. We completed enrollment of 30 out of the original target of 36 patients and closed the Phase 2 trial in late 2011 as the availability of eligible patients had been exhausted. We submitted the final report to the FDA in 2014. In February 2017, our licensee for RGN-137, GtreeBNT, received permission from the U.S. FDA to sponsor a Phase 3 clinical trial using RGN-137 to treat patients with EB. The Phase 3 trial will be a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RGN-137 topically administered to approximately 200 EB patients at clinical sites throughout the U.S. GtreeBNT will be sponsoring and funding the clinical trial, which is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2017.
 
Clinical Development — Pressure Ulcers.  In late 2005, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of RGN-137 for the treatment of patients with chronic pressure ulcers, commonly known as bedsores. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response trial, 15 clinical sites in the United States enrolled a total of 72 patients to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and wound healing effectiveness of three different concentrations of RGN-137 compared to placebo. RGN-137 was applied topically to patients’ ulcers, once daily for up to 84 consecutive days. Patients in the trial were between 19 and 85 years old and had at least one stable Stage III or IV pressure ulcer with a surface area between 5 and 70 cm2. Stage III and IV pressure ulcers are full thickness wounds that penetrate through the skin and muscle, sometimes completely to the bone.
 
In January 2009, we reported final data from this trial. RGN-137 was well-tolerated at all three dose levels studied, with no dose-limiting adverse events, which achieved the primary objective of the study. As for efficacy, all Tß4 doses performed similarly compared to placebo, with no statistically significant efficacy results. However, patients treated with the middle dose showed a 17% improvement of wound healing, which was the highest rate among the three active doses evaluated. The improvement in ulcer healing in this middle dose group following nine weeks of treatment was equal to the improvement in patients treated with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment. A follow-on evaluation, reported at the 3rd International Symposium on the Thymosins in Health and Disease in March 2012, showed that for those pressure ulcer patients’ wounds that healed, RGN-137 mid dose (0.02% Tβ4 gel product) accelerated wound closure with a median time to healing of 22 days as compared to 57 days for the placebo. Although those results are clinically significant, they were not statistically significant.
 
Clinical Development — Venous Stasis Ulcers. In mid-2006 we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of RGN-137 for the treatment of patients with venous stasis ulcers. Venous stasis ulcers are a common type of chronic wound that develops on the ankle or lower leg in patients with chronic vascular disease. In these patients blood flow in the lower extremities is impaired leading to venous hypertension, edema (swelling) and mild redness and scaling of the skin that gradually progresses to ulceration. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study, 8 European sites in Italy (N=5) and Poland (N=3) make up the 72 patients randomized to receive three different concentrations of RGN-137 or placebo. RGN-137 or placebo was applied topically to patients’ ulcers once daily for consecutive days. A patient’s ulcer size and ulcer stability for enrollment were between 3 and 30 cm2 and at least 6 weeks in duration, respectively.
 
In 2009, we reported final data from that trial. All doses of RGN-137 were well tolerated. More patients achieved healing in the RGN-137 mid dose (0.03% Tβ4 gel product) than in any other dose group. The mid dose showed both an increased incidence of wound healing and a faster healing time compared to placebo. The mid dose decreased the median time to healing by 45% among those wounds that completely healed. A follow-on evaluation, reported at the 3rd International Symposium on the Thymosins in Health and Disease in March 2012, showed that for those venous stasis ulcer patients’ wounds greater than 3 cm2 that healed, the RGN-137 mid dose (0.03% Tβ4 gel product) accelerated wound closure with a median time to healing of 49 days as compared to 78 days for the placebo. Those results were both clinically and statistically significant.
 
GtreeBNT. In March 2014, we entered into a License Agreement with GtreeBNT to license certain development and commercialization rights for RGN-137 in the U.S. In February 2017, GtreeBNT received permission from the U.S. FDA to sponsor a Phase 3 clinical trial using RGN-137 to treat patients with epidermolysis bullosa, a genetic disease that causes severe blistering of the skin and internal organs. GtreeBNT will be sponsoring and funding the clinical trial, which is planned to begin in the third quarter of 2017.

Our Strategy
 
We seek to maximize the value of our product candidates by advancing their clinical development and then identifying suitable partners for further development, regulatory approval, and marketing. We intend to engage in strategic partnerships with companies with clinical development and commercialization strengths in desired pharmaceutical therapeutic fields. We are actively seeking partners with suitable infrastructure, expertise and a long-term initiative in our medical fields of interest. To that end, we have entered several important licensing and joint venture agreements with pharmaceutical companies to develop our product candidates.
 
Our initial ownership interest in ReGenTree was 49% which was reduced to 42% upon filing of the final clinical study report with the FDA for the Phase 2b trial for Dry Eye Syndrome completed earlier in 2016. Based on when, and if, ReGenTree achieves certain additional development milestones in the U.S. with RGN-259, our equity ownership may be incrementally reduced to between 42% and 25%, with 25% being the final equity ownership upon FDA approval of an NDA for Dry Eye Syndrome in the U.S. In addition to our equity ownership, RegeneRx retains a royalty on net sales that varies between single and low double digits, depending on whether commercial sales are made by ReGenTree or a licensee. In the event the ReGenTree entity is acquired or there is a change of control that occurs following achievement of an NDA, RegeneRx shall be entitled to a minimum of 40% of all proceeds paid or payable and will forgo any future royalties.
 
The Joint Venture with GtreeBNT follows two previous transactions with GtreeBNT signed in March 2014 when we had entered into License Agreements for the license of our RGN-259 and RGN-137 product candidates. GtreeBNT licensed the development and commercialization rights for RGN-259 in Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) while also licensing the development and commercialization rights for RGN-137 in the U.S.
 
We have entered into a License Agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Limited, headquartered in Hong Kong, for the license of Thymosin Beta 4 in any pharmaceutical form, including our RGN-259, RGN-352 and RGN-137 product candidates, in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
 
We previously entered into a strategic partnership with Defiante Farmaceutica S.A., (“Defiante”), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sigma-Tau Group, a leading international pharmaceutical company, which collectively comprise our largest shareholder, or Sigma-Tau, for development and marketing of RGN-137 and RGN-352 for specified indications in Europe and other contiguous countries. Defiante merged with Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite S.p.A. in 2013 and Sigma-Tau recently merged with Alfa Wasserman S.p.A., an Italian pharmaceutical company. Currently, there is no ongoing development of our products by Alfa Wasserman.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We use a major contract manufacturer to produce bulk Tß4, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in our product candidates by an established and proven manufacturing process known as solid-phase peptide synthesis. While we do not currently have long-term supply agreements in place, we and ReGenTree intend to establish a long-term supply arrangement with at least one manufacturer once practicable. No assurance can be given, however, that such agreements will be negotiated on favorable terms, or at all. Contractors are selected on the basis of their supply capability, ability to produce a product in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements of the FDA and ability to meet our established specifications and quality requirements. Given our recent licensing and joint venture deals, our partner in Korea and the U.S. is working closely with our current primary contract manufacturer on the cGMP validation process and consistency runs, among other things, to prepare for the manufacture of bulk Tß4 for use in future clinical trials and commercialization of our formulated product candidates. Through ReGenTree we are also identifying and qualifying other potential API manufacturers. RegeneRx will have access to the data resulting from this endeavor should we need to use it for purposes outside the licensed territories.
 
We also use a number of outside contract manufacturers to formulate bulk Tß4 into our product candidates, RGN-137, RGN-259 and RGN-352. We use separate manufacturers for each formulation of Tß4. All of these formulations may require modifications, along with additional studies, as we advance our clinical development programs through commercialization.
 
One of the compelling reasons to create a joint venture with GtreeBNT to develop RGN-259 in the U.S. for ophthalmology products was their recent manufacturing experience gained from their development of RGN-259 in Korea. This experience has allowed ReGenTree to move rapidly from Phase 2 to Phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. without duplication of required Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) efforts, which are quite substantial when moving into Phase 3 and in anticipation of commercialization. GtreeBNT has been working with companies to manufacture RGN-259 in blow-filled sealed containers, which are currently being utilized for Phase 3 clinical trials and will be used for commercial marketing upon FDA approval.

As described elsewhere in this report, in 2011 our formulation and vialing contractor for RGN-352 underwent a manufacturing inspection by the FDA and was found not to be in compliance with cGMP, resulting in a clinical hold of our Phase 2 AMI clinical trial. This company has since closed its manufacturing facility and filed for bankruptcy protection. If we are to continue clinical development of RGN-352, we will need to secure a cGMP-compliant formulation and filling manufacturer of RGN-352. We have identified several cGMP-compliant companies able to perform this service.
 
Competition
 
We are engaged in a business that is highly competitive, and our target medical indications are ones with significant unmet needs. Moreover, the cosmetic and cosmeceutical industries are rapidly developing new products based on new scientific research. Consequently, there are many enterprises, both domestic and foreign, pursuing therapies and products that could compete with ours. Most of these entities have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than ours, specifically with regard to the conduct of clinical research and development activities, clinical testing and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market pharmaceutical products. Brief descriptions of some of these competitive products follow:
 
RGN-259.  Most specialty ophthalmic companies have a number of products on the market that could compete with RGN-259. There are numerous antibiotics to treat eye infections to promote corneal wound healing and many eye lubrication products that are soothing to the eye and help eye healing, many of which are sold without prescriptions. Companies also market steroids to treat certain conditions within our area of interest. Allergan, Inc. markets Restasis™, Ophthalmic Emulsion, the only commercially available and FDA-approved eye drop to treat dry eye. Restasis, and other products, have been approved for marketing in certain other countries where we have licensed RGN-259. Shire PLC is developing its product candidate, Lifitegrast, and is in pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. Shire has said it plans to resubmit an NDA for Lifitegrast in 2016. We believe RGN-259 is different than any other product candidate for dry eye in that it actively promotes repair using a multi-faceted approach of increasing cell migration and laminin-5 production, and decreasing inflammation and apoptosis.
 
RGN-352.  Currently, there are no approved pharmaceutical products for regenerating cardiac tissue following a heart attack, nor are there approved pharmaceutical products for regeneration of nervous tissue or for the remyelination of axons of patients with multiple sclerosis or patients suffering from traumatic brain injury. However, many pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are developing products, pharmacologic and stem cell therapies and technologies that are intended to prevent cardiac damage, improve cardiac function, and regenerate cardiac muscle after a heart attack. There are also companies developing products that are purported to remyelinate neurons and provide functional improvement for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and peripheral neuropathy. If we, or a partner, were to successfully develop RGN-352 for cardiovascular or central nervous system indications, such products would have to compete with other drugs or therapies currently being developed or marketed by large pharmaceutical companies for similar indications.

RGN-137.   There are numerous companies developing new pharmaceutical products for wound healing and for EB, in particular. Products and therapies such as antibiotics, honey-based ointments, silver-based compounds and low frequency cavitational ultrasound are also used to treat certain types of dermal wounds. Moreover, dermal wound healing is a large and highly fragmented marketplace that includes numerous therapeutic products and medical devices for treating acute and chronic dermal wounds.

 Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FFDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, labeling, storing, recordkeeping, distribution, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries will be a significant factor in the manufacturing and potential marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and product development activities. Any product candidate we develop will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies, clinical trials and other approval procedures by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Preclinical studies must ordinarily be conducted to evaluate an investigational new drug’s potential safety by toxicology studies and potential efficacy by pharmacology studies. The results of these studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a three-stage process. Phase 1 clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers to determine the safety profile and the pattern of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, and to assess the drug’s effect on the patient. Phase 2, or therapeutic exploratory, trials are conducted with somewhat larger groups of patients, who are selected by relatively narrow criteria yielding a more homogenous population that is afflicted with the target disease, in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. Phase 2 trials should allow for the determination of the dose to be used in Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3, or therapeutic confirmatory, large scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data for the statistical proof of safety and efficacy required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The primary objective of Phase 3 clinical trials is to show that the drug confers therapeutic benefit that outweighs any safety risks. All clinical trials must be registered with a central public database, such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, and once completed, results of the clinical trials must be entered in the database.

The results of all of these preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed information on manufacturing, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval to commence commercial sales. The FDA’s review of an NDA requires the payment of a user fee currently in excess of $1.8 million, which may be waived for the first NDA submitted by a qualifying small business. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may refuse to file the application if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria, request additional information or grant marketing approval. Therefore, even if we complete Phase 3 clinical trials for our product candidates and submit an NDA to the FDA, there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant marketing approval, or if granted, that it will be granted on a timely basis. If the FDA does approve a product candidate, it may require, among other things, post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase 4 trials, which monitor the safety of the drug. In addition, the FDA may in some circumstances impose risk evaluation and mitigation strategies that may be difficult and expensive to administer. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 
Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that the applicable clinical, pharmacovigilance, quality control and manufacturing procedures conform on an ongoing basis with current Good Clinical Practices, Good Laboratory Practices, current Good Manufacturing Practices, and computer information system validation standards. During the review of an NDA, the FDA will perform a pre-licensing inspection of select clinical sites, manufacturing facilities and the related quality control records to determine the applicant’s compliance with these requirements. To assure compliance, applicants must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of training, production and quality control. After approval of any product, manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. If a company fails to comply with FDA regulatory requirements, FDA may pursue a wide range of remedial actions, including seizure of products, corrective actions, warning letters and fines. As described in this report, in 2011 one of our prior contract manufacturers was alleged by the FDA to have not complied with current Good Manufacturing Practices, which impaired our ability to conduct a Phase 2 AMI trial with RGN-352.
 
We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for RGN-137 for the treatment of EB and RGN-259 for the treatment of neurotrophic keratopathy or NK, (now to be developed by ReGenTree). The FDA may designate a product or products as having orphan drug status to treat a disease or condition that affects less than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or, if patients of a disease number more than 200,000, the sponsor can establish that it does not realistically anticipate its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs. If a product candidate is designated as an orphan drug, then the sponsor may receive incentives to undertake the development and marketing of the product, including grants for clinical trials, as well as a waiver of the user fees for submission of an NDA application. For example, as described above, we received a grant from the FDA for our Phase 2 clinical trial of RGN-137 to treat patients with EB.
 
Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years in the United States and ten years in the EU. There may be multiple designations of orphan drug status for a given drug and for different indications. Orphan drug designation does not guarantee that a product candidate will be approved by the FDA for marketing for the designation, and even if a sponsor of a product candidate for an indication for use with an orphan drug designation is the first to obtain FDA approval of an NDA for that designation and obtains marketing exclusivity, another sponsor’s application for the same drug product may be approved by the FDA during the period of exclusivity if the FDA concludes that the competing product is clinically superior. In this instance, the orphan designation and marketing exclusivity originally granted would be lost in favor of the clinically superior product.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold worldwide patents and patent applications covering peptide compositions, uses and formulations related to dermal and ophthalmic indications and other organ and tissue repair activities, as well as for cosmetic and consumer product applications. In 2001, we entered into a license agreement with the NIH under which we received an exclusive worldwide license from the NIH for all claims within the scope of the NIH’s patent application, and any issued patents, covering the use of Tß4 as a tissue repair and regeneration factor. During 2007, patents were issued in Europe and the United States related to the original NIH patent application, which patents expire in July 2019. Corresponding patents have been granted in Hong Kong, Australia and China and certain other territories. The issued European patent was opposed by a third party at the European Patent Office and, in December 2009, we argued the case before the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office in Munich, Germany and prevailed with certain amendments to the claims. In exchange for the exclusive license, we agreed to make certain minimum royalty and milestone payments to the NIH. In 2013, we amended certain provisions of the exclusive license; we were permitted to credit amounts paid to prosecute or maintain the licensed patent rights during 2013 calendar year against the 2013 minimum annual royalty, reducing the minimum annual royalty beginning in 2014 to $2,000 and fixing the maximum sublicense participation fee. Through December 31, 2016, we have complied with all minimum royalty requirements and no milestone payments have been required under the agreement.

We hold a U.S. patent relating to the use of Tß4 for treatment of alopecia, an autoimmune skin disease that results in hair loss, which expires in 2017, with corresponding patents in Europe and Singapore that expire in 2018. In 2006, we were issued a patent in China for the use of Tß4 to treat EB, which expires in 2022.
 
We hold a U.S. patent relating to the use of Tß4 for the treatment of congestive heart failure. This patent issued in January 2012, and will expire in 2027. Other patent applications for our various product candidates, if issued, will offer protection in the U.S. and certain other territories through 2033.
 
We have also filed numerous additional U.S. and international patent applications covering various compositions, uses, formulations and other components of Tß4, as well as for novel peptides resulting from our research efforts, the latest of which were filed during 2013. There can be no assurance that these, or any other future patent applications under which we have rights, will result in the issuance of a patent or that any patent issued will not be subject to challenge or opposition. In the case of a claim of patent infringement by or against us, there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation that may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights.
 
We have also evaluated a number of our patents and patent applications in certain territories to determine whether it is cost-effective to continue to maintain or prosecute them. In some cases, we have determined that the value or potential value of such patents and/or applications is not worth the continued effort or expense and have either ceased efforts to pursue specific patents or abandoned any that have short expiries or cover countries of minimal strategic interest to us or our partners. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio and take such actions from time to time as appropriate.
 
Material Agreements
 
National Institutes of Health
 
We have entered into a license agreement with NIH under which we are obligated to pay an annual minimum royalty of $2,000. In 2013 we amended certain provisions of the exclusive license; we were permitted to credit amounts paid to prosecute or maintain the licensed patent rights during 2013 calendar year against the 2013 minimum annual royalty. Beginning in 2014 the minimum annual royalty is $2,000. Additionally, we are obligated to pay the NIH a percentage of sales of qualifying product candidates, if any. There have been no such sales to date. Through December 31, 2016, we have complied with all minimum royalty requirements, and no milestone payments have been required under the agreement.
 
Defiante/Sigma-Tau/Alfa Wassermann
 
We have exclusively licensed certain internal and external wound healing European rights to Tß4 to Defiante, which merged with Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite S. P. A. in 2013. In 2015, Sigma-Tau merged into Alfa Wassermann, an Italian pharma company. These licensed rights to Tß4 include its use to treat indications that are the subject of all of our current dermal clinical trials of RGN-137, as well as the treatment of heart attacks. The license excludes the use of Tß4 in any ophthalmic indications and other indications that are disease-based and not the result of a wound. Under the agreement, Alfa Wassermann may develop Tß4 for the treatment of internal and external wounds in Europe and certain other contiguous and geographically relevant countries. The license agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the last to expire of any granted patent in the territory having at least one valid claim covering the products then on the market, the expiration of any other exclusive or proprietary marketing rights.
 
Under the license agreement, Alfa Wassermann is obligated to pay us a royalty on commercial sales, if any, and we will supply all required Tß4 for development. Upon the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial for the covered indications that yields positive results in terms of efficacy and safety, Alfa Wassermann must either pay us a $5 million milestone payment or initiate and fund a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the applicable product candidate in order to maintain the license. We have completed two Phase 2 clinical trials of RGN-137 for the treatment of pressure ulcers and venous stasis ulcers which, due to the lack of statistical significance of the primary efficacy endpoints, did not trigger any payment obligations to us.
 
The license agreement with Defiante also contains future clinical and regulatory milestones in the licensed territory. If those milestones are attained, certain performance criteria regarding commercial registration and minimum annual royalties will be payable to us in each licensed country. The agreement does not prevent us from sublicensing the technology in countries outside the licensed territory and has no impact on any U.S. rights. RegeneRx may seek to reacquire the licensed rights back from Alfa Wassermann at some point in the future.

Lee’s Pharmaceuticals
 
On July 15, 2012, we entered into a License Agreement with Lee’s Pharmaceutical for the license of Tß4 in any pharmaceutical formulation, including our RGN-259, RGN-352 and RGN-137 product candidates, in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Lee’s paid us $200,000 upon signing of a term sheet with respect to the transaction on March 27, 2012, and Lee’s paid us an additional $200,000 upon signing of the definitive license agreement.
 
The terms of the license agreement include aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $3.6 million and royalties ranging from low double digit to high single digit royalties on commercial sales, if any.
 
Under the agreement, Lee’s is responsible for all developmental costs associated with each product candidate. We provided Tß4 to Lee’s at no charge for a Phase 2 ophthalmic clinical trial and will provide Tß4 to Lee’s for all other developmental and clinical work at a price equal to our cost.
 
The two companies have discussed Lee’s development plans and we have continued to provide information as requested. Lee’s previously filed an investigational new drug application IND with the Chinese FDA (CFDA) to conduct begin phase 2, randomized, double-masked, dose-response clinical trial with RGN-259 in China for dry-eye syndrome. In 2015, the CFDA declined Lee’s IND because the clinical trial drug product (RGN-259) was manufactured by RegeneRx outside of China, which substantially affected the proposed start of the trial. The CFDA then reversed its ruling, which once again affected the proposed trial. Lee’s is in the process of preparing new documentation for the CFDA with the hope to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in patients with dry eye syndrome later this year.
 
GtreeBNT
 
On March 7, 2014, we entered into license agreements with GtreeBNT Co., Ltd. The two Licensing Agreements are for the license of territorial rights to two of our Thymosin Beta 4-based products candidates, RGN-259 and RGN-137.
 
Under the License Agreement for RGN-259, our preservative-free eye drop product candidate, GtreeBNT will have the right to develop and commercialize RGN-259 in Asia (excluding China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau). The rights will be exclusive in Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar (Burma), Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Kazakhstan, and semi-exclusive in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, collectively, the Territory (the “259 Territory”). Under the 259 License Agreement we are eligible to receive aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $3.5 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties of a low double digit percentage of any commercial sales of the licensed product sold by GtreeBNT in the 259 Territory.
 
Under the License Agreement for RGN-137, our topical dermal gel product candidate, GtreeBNT will have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize RGN-137 in the U.S. (the”137 Territory”). Under the 137 License Agreement we are eligible to receive aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $3.5 million. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties of a low double digit percentage of any commercial sales of the Company’s licensed product sold by GtreeBNT in the 137 Territory.
 
Each license agreement contains diligence provisions that require the initiation of certain clinical trials within certain time periods that, if not met, would result in the loss of rights or exclusivity in certain countries. GtreeBNT will pay for all developmental costs associated with each product candidate. We will provide a certain limited amount of Tß4 to GtreeBNT at no charge for initial clinical trials in Korea, Japan and Australia for RGN-259 and in the U.S. for RGN-137 and will provide Tß4 to GtreeBNT for all other developmental and clinical work on a cost plus basis. We retain the manufacturing and supply rights for Tß4 in the respective Territories and the parties will negotiate in good faith an exclusive supply agreement for Tß4 as soon as practicable. We will also have the right to exclusively license any improvements made by GtreeBNT to our products outside of the licensed territory on a royalty-free basis.
 
The two firms have created a joint development committee and continue to discuss and the development of the licensed products and share information relating thereto. Both companies will also share all non-clinical and clinical data and other information related to development of the licensed product candidates.
 
U.S. Joint Venture
 
On January 28, 2015, the Company entered into the Joint Venture Agreement with GtreeBNT, a shareholder in the Company and licensee in certain Pan Asian countries. The Joint Venture Agreement provides for the creation of the Joint Venture, ReGenTree, LLC (“ReGenTree”), jointly owned by the Company and GtreeBNT that will commercialize RGN-259 for treatment of dry eye and neurotrophic keratopathy in the United States, as well as any other relevant ophthalmic indications.

GtreeBNT is solely responsible for funding all of the product development and commercialization efforts of ReGenTree. GtreeBNT made an initial contribution of $3 million in cash and received an initial equity stake of 51%. RegeneRx retains 49% ownership of ReGenTree. GtreeBNT’s equity stake may increase (and RegeneRx’s would proportionally decrease) upon ReGenTree achieving certain product development milestones (including receipt of a new drug application (“NDA”) by the U.S. FDA). GtreeBNT has subsequently funded the initial Phase 2b/3 and the ongoing Phase 3 U.S. clinical trials for dry eye syndrome and neurotrophic keratopathy, respectively.
 
Our initial ownership interest in ReGenTree was 49% and was reduced to 42% after filing of the final clinical study report with the FDA for the Phase 2/3 trial for Dry Eye Syndrome completed earlier in 2016. Based on when, and if, ReGenTree achieves certain additional development milestones in the U.S. with RGN-259, our equity ownership may be incrementally reduced to between 42% and 25%, with 25% being the final equity ownership upon FDA approval of an NDA for Dry Eye Syndrome in the U.S. In addition to our equity ownership, RegeneRx retains a royalty on net sales that varies between single and low double digits, depending on whether commercial sales are made by ReGenTree or a licensee. In the event the ReGenTree entity is acquired or there is a change of control that occurs following achievement of an NDA, RegeneRx shall be entitled to a minimum of 40% of all proceeds paid or payable and will forgo any future royalties.

ReGenTree is responsible for executing all development and commercialization activities under the License Agreement, which activities will be directed by a joint development committee comprised of representatives of the Company and GtreeBNT. The License Agreement has a term that extends to the later of the expiration of the last patent covered by the License Agreement or 25 years from the first commercial sale under the License Agreement. The License Agreement may be earlier terminated if the Joint Venture fails to meet certain commercialization milestones, or if either party breaches the License Agreement and fails to cure such breach, or as a result of government action that limits the ability of the Joint Venture to commercialize the product, as a result of a challenge to a licensed patent, following termination of the license between the Company and certain agencies of the United States federal government, or upon the bankruptcy of either party.
