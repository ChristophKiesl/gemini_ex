 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 Exact Sciences Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Exact,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a molecular diagnostics company currently focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer. We have developed an accurate, non-invasive, patient friendly screening test called Cologuard® for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and we are currently working on the development of additional tests for other types of cancer, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer diagnostics. Our Cologuard Test
 Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S. there are approximately:
· | 135,000 new cases of colorectal cancer
--+---------------------------------------


· | 50,000 deaths from colorectal cancer
--+-------------------------------------

      Colorectal cancer treatment represents a significant, growing healthcare cost. As of 2010, $14 billion was spent annually in the U.S. on colorectal cancer treatment, and the projected annual treatment costs are expected to be $20 billion in 2020. The incidence of colorectal cancer in Medicare patients is expected to rise from 106,000 cases in 2010 to more than 180,000 cases in 2030.
     It is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease—with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps or early-stage cancer—are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Accordingly, the American Cancer Society (“ACS”) recommends that all people age 50 and older undergo regular colorectal cancer screening. Of the more than 80 million people in the U.S. for whom routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, 42 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease’s late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 67 percent and 12 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test.
     Our Cologuard test is a non-invasive stool-based DNA (“sDNA”) screening test which utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Ten biomarkers are targeted that have been shown to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Methylation, mutation, and hemoglobin results are combined in the laboratory analysis through a proprietary algorithm to provide a single positive or negative reportable result.
     On August 11, 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Cologuard for use as the first and only sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, “Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,” highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population:
    
· | Cancer Sensitivity: 92%
--+------------------------


· | Stage I and II Cancer Sensitivity: 94%
--+---------------------------------------


· | High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69%
--+--------------------------------------


· | Specificity: 87%
--+-----------------

      The competitive advantages of sDNA screening may provide a significant market opportunity. If the test were used by 30-percent of the eligible screening population at a three-year screening interval rate, we estimate the potential U.S. market for sDNA screening would be more than $4 billion, annually.

 Our Cologuard Commercialization Strategy
     Our commercialization strategy includes three main elements focusing on physicians, patients, and payors.
     Physicians and Patients        Our sales team actively engages with physicians and their staffs to emphasize the need for colorectal cancer screening, educate them on the value of Cologuard, and enroll them in our physician ordering system to enable them to prescribe the test. We focus on specific physicians based on Cologuard order history and on physician groups and larger regional and national health systems. 
     Securing inclusion in guidelines and quality measures is a key part of our physician engagement strategy since many physicians rely on such guidelines and quality measures when making screening recommendations. In June 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (“USPSTF”) issued an updated recommendation statement for colorectal cancer screening and gave an "A" grade to colorectal cancer screening starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. The statement specifies seven screening methods, including FIT-DNA (which is Cologuard). 
     Professional colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the U.S., including those of the ACS, the American College of Gastroenterology (“ACG”), the American Gastroenterological Association (“AGA”) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”), recommend regular screening by a variety of methods. Since 2008, joint colorectal cancer screening guidelines endorsed by the ACS and the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (“CRC Task Force”) have included sDNA screening technology as a screening option for the detection of colorectal cancer in average risk, asymptomatic individuals age 50 and older. The CRC Task Force is a consortium of several organizations that includes representatives of the ACG, AGA, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and the American College of Physicians/Society of Internal Medicine. In October 2014, the ACS updated its colorectal cancer screening guidelines to specifically include Cologuard as a recommended sDNA screening test. In June 2016, the NCCN updated its Colorectal Cancer Screening Guidelines to add sDNA screening, at a once-every-three-years interval, to its list of recommended screening tests.

 In October 2016, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) included Cologuard testing on a three-year interval in the final 2017 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information set (“HEDIS”) measures. More than 90 percent of America’s health plans measure quality based on HEDIS. In February 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) proposed including Cologuard in the 2018 Star Ratings program, which uses HEDIS as a primary data source. The Star Ratings program is designed to measure quality in Medicare Advantage plans, help beneficiaries find a plan, and determine potential quality bonus payments. The proposal to include Cologuard in the Star Ratings program, as set forth in the Medicare Advantage Advance Notice and Draft Call letter dated February 1, 2017, is subject to a public comment period.
     A critical part of the value proposition of Cologuard is our compliance program, which involves active engagement with patients and physicians. This activity is focused on enabling patients to complete Cologuard tests that have been ordered for them by their physicians and supporting physicians in their efforts to have their patients screened. 
     After the launch of Cologuard, we initiated a significant public relations effort to engage patients in the United States. We have conducted targeted direct-to-patient advertising campaigns through social media, print and other channels. In 2016 we began a national television advertising campaign. To date, we have focused our efforts on cable television most commonly viewed by our target patient demographic, and we have begun testing advertising campaigns on network television. In 2017, we plan to continue our targeted direct-to-patient advertising initiatives and launch new content for our television advertising campaign.

 Payors
     The cornerstone of our payor-engagement strategy was securing Medicare coverage from CMS. Medicare covers 47% of patients in the screening population for Cologuard. On October 9, 2014, CMS issued a final National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) for Cologuard following a parallel review process with FDA.  Cologuard was the first screening test approved by FDA and covered by CMS through that process. As outlined in the NCD, Medicare Part B covers Cologuard once every three years for beneficiaries who meet all of the following criteria:
· | age 50 to 85 years,
--+--------------------


· | asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including but not limited to lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | at average risk for developing colorectal cancer (e.g., no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In the 2017 Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, CMS set reimbursement for Cologuard at $512.43. Payments from CMS are subject to sequestration. Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), effective January 1, 2018, the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard will be calculated based on the volume-weighted median of private payor rates for Cologuard. The initial data collection period for that purpose was the period between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The CMS reimbursement rate will subsequently be reset every three years, or every year if the Company applies for, and is granted, Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test status for Cologuard, based on the volume-weighted median of private payor rates experienced in the applicable six-month data collection period. The data for the initial collection period must be submitted to CMS by March 31, 2017 and will be subject to review by CMS prior to the finalization of the new reimbursement rate.
     In addition to Medicare reimbursement, we believe it is necessary to secure favorable coverage and reimbursement from commercial payors for Cologuard to achieve its full commercial potential. Some commercial payors have issued positive coverage decisions for Cologuard and others have agreed to cover Cologuard as an in-network service. We believe that commercial payors’ reimbursement of Cologuard will depend on a number of factors, including payors’ determination that it is: sensitive and specific for colorectal cancer; not experimental or investigational; approved or recommended by major organizations’ guidelines; subject to applicable federal and state coverage mandates; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective. Also, some payors may require that they give prior authorization for a Cologuard test before they are willing to pay for it.  Prior authorization requirements may include requirements that we, patients, or physicians provide the payor with extensive medical records and other information.
     Coverage of Cologuard may also depend, in whole or in part, on whether payors determine, or courts and/or governmental agencies determine, coverage is required under applicable federal or state laws mandating coverage of certain colorectal cancer screening services. For example, Section 2713 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) mandates that certain health insurers cover evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of “A” or “B” in the current recommendations of USPSTF without imposing any patient cost-sharing (“ACA Mandate”). Similarly, federal regulations require that Medicare Advantage plans cover “A” or “B” graded preventive services without patient cost-sharing. Following the updated USPSTF recommendation statement, the CMS issued an updated Evidence of Coverage notice for Medicare Advantage plans that affirms such plans must include coverage of Cologuard every three years without patient cost-sharing. While we believe the ACA Mandate will require certain health insurers to cover Cologuard without patient cost-sharing (following an initial phase-in period between one and two years from when the USPSTF recommendation statement was issued), it is possible that certain health insurers will disagree, in which case courts and/or governmental agencies may need to resolve this matter.  It is also possible that the ACA Mandate will be repealed or significantly modified in the future.  
     Similarly, we believe the laws of several states currently mandate coverage of Cologuard by certain health insurance companies. While some of those insurance companies have agreed with our interpretation, in certain states, others have disagreed. In some cases, we have filed lawsuits in an effort to enforce state laws we believe require coverage of Cologuard, and we may file additional suits in the future.  We may or may not be successful in any such lawsuit.

     We are pursuing a variety of strategies to increase commercial payor coverage for Cologuard, including providing cost effectiveness data to payors to make the case for Cologuard reimbursement.  We are focusing our efforts on large national and regional insurers, insurers in states with coverage mandates for colorectal cancer screening, and health plans that have affiliated health systems. 
     We believe quality metrics will help shape payors’ coverage decisions, as well as physicians’ cancer screening procedures. Some government and private payors are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments for healthcare services based on the achievement of documented quality metrics, cost efficiencies or patient outcomes. Payors may look to quality measures such as the HEDIS and CMS Star Ratings measures to assess quality of care.  We believe inclusion in the HEDIS measures and the Star Ratings measures (if the Star Ratings are revised to include Cologuard, as proposed by CMS in February 2017) will have a positive impact on payors’ willingness to reimburse Cologuard, as well as on physicians’ willingness to prescribe the test. 
 Our Clinical Lab Facility
 As part of our commercialization strategy, we established a state-of-the-art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 50,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately one million tests per year, and we have capacity to expand, if needed.  Product Pipeline
 We also are developing a pipeline of potential future products and services. We are continuing to collaborate with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“MAYO”) on developing new tests, with the goal of becoming a leader in cancer diagnostics. We believe Cologuard’s technological platform provides a strong foundation for the development of additional cancer diagnostic tests. Through our collaboration with MAYO, we have identified proprietary methylation markers for several major cancers. We have successfully performed validation studies on tissue samples for seven major cancers, including lung cancer, and on blood samples for four major cancers. 
     The ACS estimates that lung cancer will be diagnosed in 223,000 Americans and cause 156,000 deaths in the United States in 2017. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. If lung cancer is detected at an early stage, its five-year survival rate can be as high as 80%. We are currently developing a blood-based biomarker test to aid in the early detection of lung cancer in individuals with lung nodules discovered through a computerized tomography (“CT”) or other scan. Such a test may help reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and other follow-up procedures, and thereby reduce costs and improve health outcomes. We recently completed a 400 patient lung cancer study which has been submitted for publication in the spring of 2017. 
    
We also plan to continue to explore opportunities for improving Cologuard, including improvements that could lower our cost of sales.  
     Competition 
 The market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of more than 80 million Americans age 50 and above, and has attracted numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our Cologuard test faces competition from procedure‑based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and “virtual” colonoscopy, a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by CT scan (spiral computerized axial tomography), as well as traditional screening tests, such as the fecal occult blood test (“FOBT”) and FIT, and newer screening technologies such as the PillCam® COLON cleared by FDA in February 2014. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
    
In addition, a number of companies and institutions are working to develop new blood and serum‑based tests for the detection of colorectal cancer or pre-cancer, including tests based on the detection of proteins, nucleic acids, or the presence of fragments of mutated genes in the blood that are produced by colorectal cancer or pre-cancer. We are aware 

 
  7

 
of at least six other companies—Epigenomics AG, Applied Proteomics, Inc., Gene News, EDP Biotech Corporation, Illumina, Inc., and Quest Diagnostics—that are developing blood-based tests for the detection of colorectal cancer. Epigenomics AG completed a large, multi-center study designed to demonstrate the performance of its blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer and received FDA approval for its product, Epi proColon, in April 2016. On January 10, 2016, Illumina, Inc. announced the formation of GRAIL, a new company aiming to develop a blood-based, pan-cancer screening test that would seek to measure circulating nucleic acids in blood using next-generation sequencing (“NGS”) technology.  We believe other companies are also working on so-called “liquid biopsy” tests using NGS technology, and these tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard and other tests we may develop.
     Notwithstanding that the market for colorectal cancer screening is highly competitive, we believe that Cologuard, as the first and only sDNA-based non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test on the market today, compares favorably to other products and services. All other colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity, poor compliance, and high cost. The leading method, colonoscopy, involves advance dietary restrictions and bowel cleansing and can be uncomfortable, time‑consuming, hazardous, and expensive. Colonoscopy requires sedation, potential lost time from work, and someone to drive the patient home from the procedure. A 2010 study shows that seven out of 10 people age 50 and older who were told they should get a colonoscopy did not do so primarily due to fears. Fecal blood testing, including FIT testing, suffers from poor sensitivity, with only a 74 percent detection rate for cancer and 24 percent detection rate for pre‑cancers. Blood‑based DNA tests currently available are also disadvantaged by low sensitivity. Data from a validation study of one blood‑based test was released in late 2011 and published in the journal Gut in February 2013, demonstrating 48 percent sensitivity across all stages of cancer, with little sensitivity for pre‑cancer above the background false positive rate. Additionally, FIT testing suffers from low adherence over time. One study published in the American Journal of Managed Care demonstrated that only two out of every 1,000 patients studied adhered to FIT screening guidelines. 
    
Beyond our Cologuard test, as we seek to develop other tools to detect cancer and pre-cancer, we expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer diagnostic tools. These competitors include: 
    
· | biotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | academic and scientific institutions;
--+--------------------------------------


· | governmental agencies; and
--+---------------------------


· | public and private research organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------

     
We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources, or stronger business relationships. These competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. We have limited experience developing tests for detecting non-colorectal cancers and cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable testing products or services. Furthermore, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours, and they may bring those products and services to market earlier than us.
     How We Recognize Revenue
 For tests performed where we have an agreed-upon reimbursement rate or where we can estimate the amount that we will ultimately collect at the time delivery is complete, such as in the case of Medicare and certain other payors, we recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis upon delivery of a test result to an ordering physician. Accrual rates are based on the established billing rates less contractual and other adjustments, which arrive at the amount that we expect to ultimately collect. We determine the amount we expect to ultimately collect on a per-payor or per-agreement basis. The expected amount is typically lower than, if applicable, the agreed-upon reimbursement amount due to several factors, such as the amount of any patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payors, and claim denials. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received from Medicare and other payors where reimbursement was estimated is compared to previous collection estimates and, if necessary, the contractual allowance is adjusted.  Finally, should we recognize revenue from payors on an accrual basis and later determine the judgments underlying estimated collections change, our financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods. A portion of our revenue is recognized upon cash receipt, as we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the amount that will ultimately be collected from many payors.

 Our average reimbursement per test, as further defined below, was approximately $405 through December 31, 2016. This cumulative average Cologuard reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payors, changes in the payor mix, the effects of contracts signed with payors, changes in allowed amounts by payors, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, settlements reached with payors regarding previously denied claims, and our ability to collect cash payments from payors and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement.    We calculate the average Cologuard reimbursement per test from all payors on a trailing twelve-month basis, whether they are on a cash or an accrual basis, for tests that are at least six months old, since it can often take that long, or in some cases longer, to collect from some payors. Thus, the average reimbursement per test represents the total cash collected through December 31, 2016 for tests performed during the relevant period divided by the number of tests performed during that same period.    We incur expense for tests in the period in which the testing activities occur and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. Accordingly, any revenue that we recognize as a result of cash collection related to previously performed but unpaid tests will favorably impact our liquidity and results of operations in future periods.    The components of our revenue, as recognized upon accrual or cash receipt, were as follows: 

 | Year Ended December 31, | | 
(In thousands) | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014 | 
Revenue recognized on an accrual basis | $ | 87,037 | | $ | 36,364 | | $ | 1,388
Revenue recognized when cash is received | | 12,339 | | | 3,073 | | | 116 
Total | $ | 99,376 | | $ | 39,437 | | $ | 1,504

      Of the revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately $3.0 million relates to tests processed in the prior year for which our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met until 2016 and for which we waited to recognize revenue until cash was received.
 Research and Development

Research and development costs account for a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Our research and development expenses were $33.5 million, $33.9 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Research and development expenses are expected to increase in the future as we work on developing additional products related to cancer diagnostic testing and improving Cologuard.  Seasonality
 We are in the early stages of Cologuard’s commercialization and are continuing to learn how seasonal factors may affect our business.  Based on our experience to date, we expect some seasonal variations in our financial results due to a variety of factors, such as the year-end holiday period and other major holidays, vacation patterns of both patients and physicians, climate and weather conditions in our markets and other factors relating to the timing of patient deductibles and co-insurance limits.  Government Regulation
 Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and export of diagnostic products. Our clinical laboratory is subject to oversight by CMS pursuant to CLIA, as well as agencies in various states, including New York.  Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration
 FDA granted premarket approval (“PMA”) for Cologuard in August 2014.  That PMA approval places substantial restrictions on how Cologuard is marketed and sold, specifically, by prescription only. Additionally, the regulations governing our approval require controls on Cologuard, including, but not limited to, manufacturing facility registration, 

 
  9

 
product listing with the FDA, complying with labeling requirements, maintenance of a satisfactory quality management system, and meeting post-market surveillance requirements. In addition, as a condition of our FDA approval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study. There can be no assurance that the results of this study will be satisfactory and will not cause the FDA to modify or withdraw our approval for Cologuard.
 We may develop new diagnostic products and services that are regulated by the FDA as medical devices.  We may also develop diagnostic products or services that, under today’s laws, would be regulated as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) under CLIA.  However, as noted below, the regulation of LDTs may be in flux, as the FDA has recently retracted a proposal for increased LDT oversight.
 FDA-Regulated Medical Devices
 Unless otherwise exempted, medical devices must receive from the FDA either “510(k) clearance” or PMA before marketing them in the United States.  Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes may be costly and time consuming, but the PMA approval process is typically more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. 
 The FDA determines whether a medical device will require either 510(k) clearance or the PMA process based on statutory criteria that utilize a risk-based classification system. If the FDA decides one of our future products may undergo the 510(k) clearance process (class II), we would typically be required to submit a premarket notification.  In the premarket notification, we would need to demonstrate that our proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use, safety, and effectiveness to certain existing, legally marketed devices. This is a traditional 510k clearance. In some instances, the risk criteria of a device may be deemed low enough for premarket clearance, but the FDA may reject the substantial equivalence argument that is presented. In these instances, a de novo 510k pathway (“de novo”) may be available. The regulatory requirements of the de novo are similar to a PMA except that clinical evidence requirements may be less, and premarket inspections are not required.  If we were to obtain 510(k) clearance for a product and then make changes to that product, we would need to seek a new 510(k) clearance.
 The PMA process, which would be necessary if the product classification is high risk (class III), involves submitting extensive data to the FDA. These data allow the FDA to determine if the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process may include the convening of expert panels, inspection of our manufacturing facilities, and providing additional data and updates to the FDA, or new or supplemented PMA submissions, if the product is modified during the process or after approval. 
 Even if granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA may place substantial restrictions on how a device is marketed or sold, and regulations governing any medical device products require controls, including but not limited to registering manufacturing facilities, listing the products with the FDA, complying with labeling requirements, maintaining an adequate quality management system, and meeting post-market surveillance requirements. The studies required in connection with our seeking either a 510(k) clearance or PMA for any of our new diagnostics products would be costly and time intensive. There can be no assurance that the FDA would ultimately clear any 510(k) premarket notification or approve any PMA request submitted by us in a timely manner or at all. 
 Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”)
     LDTs are clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use.  Historically, LDTs have been regulated under CLIA while the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for many LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because LDTs were limited in number, were relatively simple tests, and were typically used to diagnose rare disease and uncommon conditions. 
 In October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents describing a proposed risk-based framework under which the FDA might regulate LDTs. The FDA’s draft framework proposed, among other things, premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared diagnostics currently on the market. In November 2015, the FDA issued a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs and stated the FDA is continuing to work to finalize premarket review requirements for LDTs. However, in November 2016 FDA confirmed it would not finalize its guidance on the regulation of LDTs to allow more time for public discussion and time for the congressional authorizing committees to develop a legislative solution. The 

 
  10

 
FDA’s guidance documents, if and when finalized, or action by FDA to exercise enforcement discretion over LDTs, may materially impact our development and commercialization of LDTs.
 Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing
 We are also subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense.
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. We perform activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services and entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities.
 Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws. For example, there are also state and international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Antifraud Laws/Overpayments. We are subject to numerous federal and state antifraud and abuse laws, including the Federal False Claims Act. Many of these antifraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include:
· | the submission of false claims or false information to government programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the retention of any overpayments by governmental payors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | deceptive or fraudulent conduct;
--+---------------------------------


· | excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | defrauding private sector health insurers.
--+-------------------------------------------

  We are subject to substantial penalties for violations of anti-fraud and abuse laws, including denial of payment and refunds, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery.
 In addition, amendments to the False Claims Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from governmental payors. Within 60 days of identifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing payments to greater scrutiny.  On February 11, 2016, CMS published a final rule clarifying the obligation to report and return federal healthcare program overpayments.  Overpayments may occur from time to time in the healthcare industry without any fraudulent intent. For example, overpayments may result from mistakes in reimbursement claim forms or from improper processing by 

 
  11

 
governmental payors. We maintain protocols intended to identify any overpayments. From time to time we may identify overpayments and be required to refund those amounts to government payors. 
 To avoid liability, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments.
 Federal and State “Self‑Referral” and “Anti-Kickback” Restrictions
 If we or our operations are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations prohibiting improper referrals for healthcare services or products, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Anti‑Kickback Statute. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, unless an exception applies. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Sanctions for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.
 Self‑Referral law. The federal “self‑referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.
 Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. 
 Sunshine Act
 In 2010, Congress enacted a statute commonly known as the Sunshine Act, which aims to promote transparency. The Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS any payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, unless an exception applies. Manufacturers must also disclose to CMS any physician ownership or investment interests. Our failure to comply with the reporting requirements of this law may subject us to substantial penalties.  Other Laws
 Occupational Safety and Health. In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare‑related facilities. In addition, because our operations require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must 

 
  12

 
address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
 Specimen Transportation. Our commercialization activities for Cologuard subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
 Environmental. The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business.  There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the year ended December 31, 2016, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 Intellectual Property
 We have intellectual property rights pertaining to sample type, sample preparation, sample preservation, biomarkers, and related methods and formulations.
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect our technologies through patent coverage. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 26 issued patents and 36 pending patent applications in the United States, and 34 issued patents and 47 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, as part of our 2009 strategic transaction with Genzyme Corporation, we exclusively license back from Genzyme, in the fields of colorectal cancer screening and stool‑based detection of any disease or condition, the 24 patents issued and 2 pending patent applications in the United States, and 36 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions sold to Genzyme.
 Each of our patents generally has a term of 20 years from its respective priority filing date. The earliest of our issued patents to expire will expire in 2017, and the last of these to expire will expire in 2033.
 License Agreements
 We license certain technologies that are, or may be, incorporated into our technology under several license agreements. Generally, the license agreements require us to pay royalties based on certain net revenues received, and may require minimum royalty amounts, milestone payments, and maintenance fees. MAYO
 On June 11, 2009, we entered into a license agreement with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“MAYO”). Our license agreement with MAYO was amended and restated in February 2015 and further amended in January 2016. Under the license agreement, MAYO granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain MAYO patents and patent applications, as well as a non‑exclusive, worldwide license with regard to certain MAYO know‑how. The scope of the license covers any screening, surveillance or diagnostic tests or tools for use in connection with any type of cancer, pre-cancer, disease or condition.  
 The licensed MAYO patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims that relate to sample processing, analytical testing, and data analysis associated with nucleic screening for cancers and other diseases. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, and Japan. In addition to granting us a license to the covered MAYO intellectual property, MAYO agreed to make available personnel to provide us product development and research and development assistance. Under the license agreement, we assumed the obligation and expense of prosecuting and maintaining the licensed MAYO patents and are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed MAYO intellectual property. 

MAYO has agreed to make available personnel through January 2020 to provide us product development and research and development assistance.
 Pursuant to our agreement with MAYO, we are required to pay MAYO a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the licensed MAYO intellectual property, with minimum annual royalty fees of $25,000 each year through 2033, the year the last patent expires. The January 2016 amendment to the MAYO license agreement established 

 
  13

 
various low single-digit royalty rates on net sales of current and future products and clarified how net sales will be calculated.  As part of the amendment, the royalty rate on our net sales of Cologuard increased and, if in the future, improvements are made to the Cologuard product, the royalty rate may further increase. However, the amendment provides that the Cologuard royalty will remain a low single-digit percentage of net sales. 
 In addition to the royalty rates described above, we are also required to issue MAYO shares of our common stock with a value of $0.2 million upon commercial launch of our second and third products that use the licensed MAYO intellectual property, as well as to pay MAYO, for each of our products that use licensed MAYO intellectual property, $0.2 million cash upon such product reaching $5.0 million in cumulative net sales, $0.8 million cash upon such product reaching $20 million in cumulative net sales, and $2 million cash upon such product reaching $50 million in cumulative net sales.
 As part of the February 2015 amendment and restatement of the license agreement, we agreed to pay MAYO an additional $5.0 million, payable in five annual installments, through 2019.
 The license agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2033 (or later, if certain licensed patent applications are issued). However, if we are still using the licensed MAYO know‑how or certain MAYO‑provided biological specimens or their derivatives on such expiration date, the term shall continue until the earlier of the date we stop using such know‑how and materials and the date that is five years after the last of the licensed patents expires. The license agreement contains customary termination provisions and permits MAYO to terminate the license agreement if we sue MAYO or its affiliates, other than any such suit claiming an uncured material breach by MAYO of the license agreement.
 Hologic
 In October 2009, we entered into a technology license agreement with Hologic, Inc. (“Hologic”). Under the license agreement, Hologic granted us an exclusive, worldwide license within the field of human stool based colorectal cancer and pre‑cancer detection or identification with regard to certain Hologic patents, patent applications and improvements, including Hologic’s Invader detection chemistry (the “Covered Hologic IP”). The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Australia and Japan. The license agreement also provided us with non‑exclusive, worldwide licenses to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of clinical diagnostic purposes relating to colorectal cancer (including cancer diagnosis, treatment, monitoring or staging) and the field of detection or identification of colorectal cancer and pre‑cancers through means other than human stool samples. In December 2012, we entered into an amendment to this license agreement with Hologic pursuant to which Hologic granted us a non‑exclusive worldwide license to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of any disease or condition within, related to or affecting the gastrointestinal tract and/or appended mucosal surfaces.
 We are required to pay Hologic a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of products using the Covered Hologic IP.
 Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2029. The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permit termination in the event of material uncured breaches.
 MDx Health
 In July 2010, we entered into a technology license agreement with MDx Health S.A. (formerly Oncomethylome Sciences, S.A.) (“MDx Health”). Under the license agreement, MDx Health granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to sell products, and a license to sell services in the United States, in the field of in vitro diagnostic testing of fecal samples for detection of colorectal cancer and colorectal pre‑cancer to certain patents and patent applications related to DNA methylation biomarkers. The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition‑of‑matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, China and Japan. Under the agreement, we are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed MDx Health patents. We are required to pay MDx Health a minimum royalty fee of $0.1 million on each anniversary of the agreement for the life of the contract. In 2015, we paid 

 
  14

 
MDx Health $0.2 million after we reached net sales of $10 million of a licensed product after receipt of FDA approval. In 2016, we paid MDx Health $0.8 million after we reached cumulative net sales of $50 million. Additionally, we will pay them $1 million after we reach net sales of $50 million in a single calendar year. We are also required to pay MDx Health a low single-digit royalty on our net sales of licensed products and services. Unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2028. The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permit termination in the event of material uncured breaches.
