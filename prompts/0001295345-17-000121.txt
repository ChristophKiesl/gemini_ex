 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
Corporate Background
 We are a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of a platform utilizing proprietary cold vaporization technology to commercialize health, wellness and beauty treatments (the “Platform”). As of the date hereof, we have limited operations and no revenues from our business operations. There is substantial doubt that we can continue as a going concern and an on-going business for the next twelve months without the success of our business operations. We expect to commence generating revenue during 2018.  We project that we will need to raise up to $2,000,000 during the next 12 months in order to successfully implement our business plan and to become profitable, of which there can be no assurance. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms, if at all, when needed, may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our products development efforts and secure regulatory approvals and would adversely impact our planned research and development efforts in connection with the Company's future products, which may make it more difficult for us to attain profitability.

On February 8, 2016, we signed a Merger Agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Novomic Ltd, a private company organized under the laws of the State of Israel ("Novomic") and a Shareholders' Agreement with the Novomic shareholders (the "Shareholders' Agreement"). The Merger Agreement was by and between the Company, on the one hand, and Novomic together with YMY Industry Ltd ("YMY") and Microdel Ltd ("Microdel"), the latter two of which are hereinafter referred to as the "Novomic Founders," on the other hand. On August 9, 2016, the merger closed and Novomic became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon closing of the merger, the former Novomic shareholders owned approximately73.52% and Techcare stockholders retained approximately 26.48% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, while Techcare was the legal acquirer, Novomic was treated as the acquiring company in the merger for accounting purposes, and the merger was accounted for as a reverse merger as described in note4 to our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 which are included within Item 8 in this annual report. As a result, the financial statements of the Company prior to the merger date are the historical financial statements of Novomic, whereas the financial statements of the Company after the merger date reflect the results of the operations of Novomic and Techcare on a combined basis. In connection with the closing, the Company (i) changed its name from BreedIT Corp. to TechCare Corp.; (ii) the 149,219,173 outstanding shares of the Registrant's common Stock were subject to a reverse split on a one-for-thirty (1:30) basis (the "Reverse Split") resulting in 4,973,972 outstanding shares of common stock; and (iii) authorized ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (the "Preferred Stock"), which may be issued in one or more classes or series, having such designations, preferences, privileges and rights as the Board of Directors may determine. The foregoing was approved by FINRA on October 21, 2016. Following the closing, the Registrant's Board of Directors consists of three persons, one designated by the TechCare Corp. shareholders and the remaining two designated by the Novomic shareholders. Novomic was incorporated as a private limited liability Company in Israel in 2009. Since inception, Novomic has been a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of the Platform utilizing its proprietary device that vaporizes liquids from a contained capsule into a treatment area.  Our Treatment Solutions
 Novokid – Natural, Plant-based and Effective Lice Treatment
 Parents and children exposed to head lice are now forced to use standard Over the Counter ("OTC") treatments that are toxic, often ineffective, time consuming and expensive. The global market for head lice treatments is estimated at $1.8 billion per annum whereas 6-12 million children get head lice each year in the US alone causing indirect damages estimated at $1 billion per annum. According to the Journal of Medical Entomology, 98% of lice have developed resistance to existing treatments in the US and they have now referred to as “super-lice”. Most current treatments contain pesticides, alcohol or silicone, which are all associated with a wide variety of hazardous side effects. Novokid is a non-pesticide, natural, plant-based and eco-friendly solution that eliminates lice and super lice by a 10 minute dry treatment. This compares with current treatments that required 20-40 minutes of shampooing and daily combing. Our treatment is fast, dry, clean, and easily administered at home or on the go. Novokid can also be used as a maintenance and preventative treatment if used regularly. Shine – Natural Haircare rejuvenation
 Shine uses cold vaporization and a proprietary formulation to clean, treat and improve the appearance of the hair and scalp. In addition to removing the residue of products, the treatments will balance the hair’s pH levels, add body and shine, define curls, and strengthen and protect hair from further damage. Like our solution for lice, users simply put a Shine capsule in the compressor, place the attached cap on their head and sit for a 10-minute treatment. There is no need to rinse or shampoo following the treatment.

The global hair care market is estimated to be in excess of $80 billion per annum, and we are looking to establish a presence in the home treatment niche. To that end, we are in the process of expanding the Shine treatment product line to include formulations for the needs of specific hair types, such as dry, curly, colored, and over-processed hair. Recent Developments and Plans
 Our current and future products are all based on the Platform which was developed over a period of 7 years. During the past 18 months, we have achieved the following:      Performed extensive market research for the lice treatment/prevention market;
      Completed product development of Novokid, which included finalization of commercial design of vaporizer, capsules and head cap, optimizing the product efficiency, negotiating and finalizing the product supply chain across various suppliers;
     Received the Israeli Ministry of health approval (AMAR) to market the lice product in Israel;
     Attained ISO 9001certification;
     Regulation: In advance stages of obtaining CE (the European Union) certificate;
     Conducted extensive tests and measurements for treatment calibration protocol and efficiency;
     Obtained recommendations from leading senior pediatrics; and
     Opened Company headquarters offices in Israel’s Rosh Ha’ayin Industrial Park. During the next 12-18 months, Novomic plans to focus its efforts on the following:       Finalizing distribution, Original Equipment Manufacturer and Joint Venture agreements with well-known companies in Israel and abroad;      Further optimization of Novokid and Shine products;
     Reduction of manufacturing costs;
      Commencing the development and commercialization of the Company's future product line mainly to the fields of hair cosmetics, pest treatments and dermatology related cosmetics treatments;
      Obtain additional regulatory approvals from the following regulatory agencies CE and the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) among others;     Complete preparations for mass production by launching an automated capsule production line;
     Presenting the platform and its application in leading conferences around the globe; and
     Online sales of the head lice treatment platform. With respect to FDA approval, we are in advanced negotiations with a US distributor which will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining FDA approval for the head lice treatment platform including the Device and capsules.

While there can be no assurance, the Company expects to sign a binding term-sheet with the US distributor during the first half of 2017; and expects that the FDA approval process should take approximately 12 months at a cost of approximately $150,000. We may be required to obtain additional regulatory approvals for the head lice treatment platform and its future products. If unable to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our products candidates, our business will be adversely affected. CE approval is required for the marketing, distributing and sale of our products in the EU, whereas FDA approval is required for such marketing, distributing and sale in the US.  In the event the products are to be sold in certain territories requiring additional regulatory approvals, such will be obtained by us and/or by our distributors. Sales and Marketing
 While the vaporizer for both Novokid and Shine is designated to be a one-time purchase, the Head Cap, and especially the capsules, will be sold separately based on the razor/razor-blade business model and based on our estimates, which we believe are both reasonable and conservative. Our target customers are expected to purchase between 12-16 capsule units per year. Therefore, we estimate that the majority of the revenues that the Company will generate in the future will be based on capsules sales for both Novokid and Shine products. The Company plans to focus its initial sales and marketing efforts on two of the largest markets in the world – the EU and US markets, starting in the EU where regulatory approval is expected in Q3 2017. In order to achieve its intended global footprint and market presence, the Company's primary distribution method will be based on the Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") model, in which the distributor will sell our Products under its own name and branding. We believe that the OEM model will reduce our marketing costs to a minimum while starting to generate revenues to support our R&D efforts for utilizing our technological platform to expand our product line. The Company also plans to market and advertise its products through online and e-commerce channels, which we believe will present a huge opportunity for generating sales and market acceptance. Research and Development
 We spent approximately $1.5 million on R&D during the past two years. During this period, the Company completed the products development of both Novokid and Shine, which included finalization of commercial design of compressor, capsules and head cap and optimizing the products efficiency. The Company plans to build upon the R&D achievements it had with the completion of the head lice treatment product as the basis to expand its variety of treatments and solutions, which will also be based on the developed platform and the knowledge the Company gained principally during the past two years.

Intellectual Property
 Due to the importance of patents, the Company has devoted significant efforts and resources and will continue to invest resources in strengthening its patent portfolio. Below is the list of patents registered by the Company to date: 
Patents | Each patent's relevance to the program | Date and status of registration 
----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------
EP 2 438 830 B1 | Treating lice with gaseous compounds in an airtight space. | 16.07.2014 
US 9/307820 B2 | Treating lice with gaseous compounds in an airtight space. | 12.04.2016 
US 15/438842 * | Treating an object with gaseous compounds in an airtight space. | 22.02.2017 

 *Under approval process.  The Company plans to expand existing patents related to pushing air using its mechanical Compressor and new substances which are now being researched and documented, and more subjects that will be developed during research. Competition
 Novokid
 In the key markets, in which the Company plans to compete, our competition will range from prescription and OTC treatments, many of which are well-established and accepted in the market, to simple home remedies, which include occlusive agents, such as “petrolatum shampoo,” mayonnaise, butter or margarine, herbal oils, and olive oil, applied to suffocate the lice. These home remedies, while widely used, have not been evaluated for effectiveness in randomized controlled trials. To date, only anecdotal information is available concerning effectiveness. At present, there are four to five products and many low-cost generics and store brand equivalents that dominate the lice treatment market. However, the active ingredients in these pharmacological therapies are mostly based on chemical insecticides. A major problem that chemical-based solutions are now facing (mainly pyrethroids) is that a growing amount of head lice have developed gene mutation that made them resisted to pyrethroids (those lice are being referred in the common population as “Super Lice”). Pyrethroids are the family of insecticides used to kill lice in common over-the-counter treatment products. However, during our research we found that no product on the market today provides a complete solution comparable to our treatment, which we believe will place us in position to succeed in the head lice treatment market. Our treatment is designed to create an isolated, controlled environment around the head lice-infested area, in-which a vapor concentration of acetic acid is created, which will be fatal for lice and their eggs, but harmless to the skin and hair of the patient. Shine
 In the key markets, in which the Company plans to compete, our competition will range from other beauty and hair care related devices and other dry cosmetic products. Our market research has indicated that we present a unique and innovative alternative to such treatments presenting an efficient, easy to use, cost effective treatment.

Seasonality
It is unlikely that all head lice infestations can be prevented, because children come into head-to-head contact with each other frequently, most often in school or in other environments where children are together. As a result, head-lice incidence peaks during the school year and during the summer camps. Therefore, we expect strong demand for our product throughout the year with minor or no seasonality fluctuations. Social and Economic Factors
 Schools in the United States, Canada, and Australia commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed. This could have major social implications on both the children and the parents that are required on a day's notice to cease their day-to-day activities and focus on their child's head lice problem. To save time and for better results, we believe that people will readily accept and use the latest technology and cost efficient product represented by the Company's treatment. For the year ended 2016, the corporate tax rate in Israel is 25% and has signed tax treaties with many countries to reduce export and import tariffs. We believe that this export friendly policy of Israel will help our business because we will be manufacturing the capsules, which are the main component of the products in Israel, for export to the United States, Canada and countries of European Union with the collective market we estimate has up to hundreds of millions of persons, mostly children, infected with head lice on an annual basis. Government Regulation
 Our head lice treatment is subject to regulation by and approval from CE and the FDA. EU regulations specify that treatments for human diseases be classified either as a medicinal product or a medical device. Pediculosis (head lice) treatments fall into both categories, as will be explored in further detail below. The EU defines three different classes of pediculosis treatments: 1. Those that act via pharmacologically active ingredients (such as insecticides like pyrethrum extract, organophosphates or carbamates). These are classified as medicinal products. Such treatments have to overcome possibilities of resistance and toxicity (for example, the phasing out of lindane in Europe over toxological and environmental concerns). 2. A more recent class of treatments are those that act via a physical mechanism, as opposed to a chemical one. These are classified as medical devices and include silicone oil-based treatments such as dimeticones. By contrast to the former class of treatments, these are non-toxic to humans and are not likely to suffer from problems of resistance. 3. The third class of treatments are those which are based on essential oils and herbal extracts. Efficacy claims for such treatments have been advanced under both chemical and physical headings: they are mostly registered as medical devices. With respect to CE approval, we have applied for a class I medical device CE approval which we reasonably expect to receive during Q32017. The aggregate cost of the CE approval process, including required testing, is $17,800. FDA-approved treatments for head lice include both OTC products and prescription drugs, such as Nix and Rid, in the form of shampoos, creams and lotions. However, many head lice products are not for use in children under the age of 2. Although OTC drugs are available for treatment of head lice, health care professionals often prescribe drugs recently approved by the FDA, such as Ulesfia (approved in 2009), Natroba (approved in 2011) or Sklice (approved in 2012). With respect to FDA approval, we are in advanced negotiations with a US distributor which will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining FDA approval for the head lice treatment platform including the Device and capsules. While there can be no assurance, the Company expects to sign a binding term sheet with the US Distributor during the first half of 2017 and expects that the FDA approval process should take approximately 12 months at a cost of approximately $150,000. Employees
 We currently engage 12 employees and service providers working in various fields of management R&D, Product management, marketing and regulatory advice.
