ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview 
We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing both small-molecule and protein therapeutics for large-market as well as orphan indications targeting inflammation, coagulopathies and disorders of the central nervous system.
Our marketed drug product OMIDRIA® was launched in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2015 for use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens, or IOL, replacement. OMIDRIA is part of our proprietary PharmacoSurgery® platform, which is designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients undergoing ophthalmological, arthroscopic, urological and other surgical procedures. Our PharmacoSurgery platform is based on low-dose combinations of FDA-approved therapeutic agents delivered directly to the surgical site throughout the duration of the procedure to inhibit preemptively inflammation and other problems caused by surgical trauma and to provide clinical benefits both during and after surgery.
In our pipeline we have clinical-stage development programs focused on: complement-associated thrombotic microangiopathies; complement-mediated glomerulonephropathies; Huntington’s disease and cognitive impairment; and addictive and compulsive disorders. In addition, we have a diverse group of preclinical programs and two additional platforms: one capable of unlocking new G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, drug targets and the other used to generate antibodies. For OMIDRIA and each of our product candidates and our programs, other than OMS103, we have retained control of all commercial rights.
Commercial Product -- OMIDRIA® (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection) 1%/0.3%
Overview. OMIDRIA is approved by the FDA for use during cataract surgery or IOL replacement to maintain pupil size by preventing intraoperative miosis (pupil constriction) and to reduce postoperative ocular pain, and is approved in all EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway (together, the European Economic Area, or EEA) for use during cataract surgery and other IOL replacement procedures to maintain mydriasis (pupil dilation), to prevent miosis (pupil constriction), and to reduce postoperative eye pain. OMIDRIA is a proprietary drug product containing two active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs: ketorolac, an anti-inflammatory agent, and phenylephrine, a mydriatic, or pupil dilating, agent. Cataract and other lens replacement surgery involve replacement of the original lens of the eye with an artificial intraocular lens. These procedures are typically performed to replace a lens opacified by a cataract or to correct a refractive error. OMIDRIA is added to standard irrigation solution used during cataract and lens replacement surgery and is delivered intracamerally, or within the anterior chamber of the eye, to the site of the surgical trauma throughout the procedure. Preventing pupil constriction is essential for these procedures and, if miosis occurs, the risk of damaging structures within the eye and other complications increases as does the operating time required to perform the procedure.
United States. We launched OMIDRIA in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2015 primarily through wholesalers which, in turn, sell to ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs, and hospitals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has granted transitional pass-through reimbursement status for OMIDRIA, which we expect to run until January 1, 2018. Pass-through status allows for separate payment (i.e., outside the bundled payment) under Medicare Part B for new drugs and other medical technologies that meet well-established criteria specified by federal regulations governing Medicare spending. We are working through legislative and/or administrative means to continue to obtain separate or similar reimbursement for OMIDRIA on and after January 1, 2018; however, in the event that does not occur, we expect that OMIDRIA will be included as part of the packaged procedural payment and, as a result, the per unit price we receive for OMIDRIA would likely be reduced.
We have implemented various purchase volume discount programs for OMIDRIA. In addition, we have entered into agreements to enable discounts for OMIDRIA on qualifying purchases of OMIDRIA by certain U.S. government purchasers and other eligible entities (e.g., 340B-eligible hospitals and clinics). In addition, in 2015 we launched the OMIDRIAssure® Reimbursement Services Program, or OMIDRIAssure. The OMIDRIAssure program services include the:
6


• | OMIDRIAssure Information Hotline for physicians and facilities seeking personalized help and information on OMIDRIA coverage and reimbursement for patients;


• | “Equal Access” Patient Assistance Program providing assistance to financially eligible uninsured or government-insured patients; and


• | “We Pay the Difference” Commercially Insured Patient Reimbursement Program providing assistance to patients with insufficient commercial insurance.

The OMIDRIAssure coverage and reimbursement support services for surgeons and facilities help remove uncertainties about coding, billing and coverage of OMIDRIA. The “Equal Access” Patient Assistance and the “We Pay the Difference” Commercially Insured Patient Reimbursement Programs help address financial barriers restricting patient access to the drug. Under the “Equal Access” program, financially eligible uninsured and government-insured patients receive OMIDRIA free of charge for use during surgery. For commercially insured patients, through our “We Pay the Difference” program we pay the facility, on behalf of the patient, the difference between the facility’s acquisition cost for OMIDRIA, after accounting for any applicable volume discounts, and the amount covered by the patient's insurance.
European Union and other International Territories. In 2015, we received approval from the European Commission, or EC, to market OMIDRIA in the EEA for use during cataract surgery and other IOL replacement procedures to maintain mydriasis (pupil dilation), to prevent miosis (pupil constriction), and to reduce postoperative eye pain. For the EU OMIDRIA marketing authorization to remain valid, product must be placed on the market (i.e., released into the distribution chain) in at least one EEA country by July 28, 2018. Decisions about price and reimbursement for OMIDRIA are made on a country-by-country basis and may be required before marketing may occur in a particular country. We do not expect to see sales of OMIDRIA in the EU and other international territories if we do not obtain such pricing and/or reimbursement decisions or if we are unable to enter into partnerships for the marketing and distribution of OMIDRIA. Timing of any such partnerships depends on numerous factors, including completion of mutual diligence exercises and domestic sales of OMIDRIA.
We have an exclusive supply and distribution agreement, or the ITROM Agreement, with ITROM Trading Drug Store, or ITROM, for the sale of OMIDRIA in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and certain other countries in the Middle East. Within the licensed territory, ITROM is responsible for obtaining marketing authorizations for OMIDRIA on our behalf and for promoting, marketing, selling and distributing product supplied by us. ITROM began selling OMIDRIA in December 2016 on a limited basis in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We expect that our revenue from ITROM’s sales will increase in 2017, pending approval of local regulatory applications.
Pediatric Studies. We have completed an FDA-required post-marketing OMIDRIA pediatric clinical trial. The clinical trial was conducted to fulfill both the post-marketing requirement as well as a Written Request from the FDA to conduct a pediatric study. Patients in this trial received either OMIDRIA or phenylephrine added to the irrigation solution used during the surgical procedure. In the trial, OMIDRIA was well tolerated with adverse event rates consistent with those seen in pediatric cataract surgery and similar in the OMIDRIA and phenylephrine groups. Successful completion of the trial, including submission of a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, that includes the full clinical study report and proposed labeling, plus confirmation by the FDA that the submission fulfills the FDA’s Written Request, results in eligibility for an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity for OMIDRIA and label expansion to include information on dosing for pediatric patients. We expect to submit an sNDA this year, with results of the pediatric study included in proposed label language. Although conducted in patients newborn to three years old, the FDA agreed that results from this trial can be extrapolated to patients through 18 years of age, and a label expansion, if any, would be expected to be applicable to that full age range.
Abbreviated New Drug Application. In July 2015, we received a Notice Letter from Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. and its subsidiary, Par Sterile Products, LLC, or collectively, Par, that Par had filed with the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, containing a Paragraph IV Certification under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking approval to market a generic version of OMIDRIA prior to the expiration of three patents listed in the Orange Book for OMIDRIA, or the Orange Book Patents. These patents were granted following review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, are presumed to be valid under governing law, and can only be invalidated in federal court with clear and convincing evidence. We have reviewed the assertions in Par’s Paragraph IV Notice Letter and believe that they do not have merit. We intend to enforce vigorously our intellectual property rights relating to OMIDRIA, including the three patents referenced in Par’s Paragraph IV Notice Letter, as well as three additional patents that issued after Par’s Notice Letter. Following receipt of the Paragraph IV Notice Letter, in September 2015 we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Par. For more information regarding this ANDA, see “Governmental Regulation-Abbreviated New Drug Application,” and for more information regarding our patent infringement lawsuit against Par, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”

MASP Clinical and Preclinical Programs
MASP-2 Program - OMS721 - Lectin Pathway Disorders
Overview. Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2, or MASP-2, is a novel pro-inflammatory protein target involved in activation of the complement system, which is an important component of the immune system. The complement system plays a role in the inflammatory response and becomes activated as a result of tissue damage or trauma or microbial pathogen invasion. Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of the complement system can cause diseases characterized by serious tissue injury. MASP-2 is recognized as the effector enzyme, and is required for the function, of the lectin pathway, one of the principal complement activation pathways. Importantly, inhibition of MASP-2 does not appear to interfere with the antibody-dependent classical complement activation pathway, which is a critical component of the acquired immune response to infection. We are developing MASP-2 antibodies and small molecules and we expect that the intended therapeutic effect can be achieved through multiple routes of administration, including subcutaneous and intravenous administration of our antibodies and oral and intravenous administration of our small molecules. OMS721 is our lead human monoclonal antibody targeting MASP-2. 
OMS721 is being developed for diseases in which the lectin pathway is believed to contribute to significant tissue injury and pathology. One group of such diseases is thrombotic microangiopathies, or TMAs, including aHUS and HSCT-TMA. These diseases are typically characterized by significant kidney or central nervous system injury when not treated. We have a Phase 3 clinical program in patients with aHUS and enrollment has opened in the Phase 3 clinical trial. The Phase 3 clinical program in patients with aHUS consists of one clinical trial - a single-arm (i.e., no control arm), open-label trial in patients with newly diagnosed or ongoing aHUS. We expect that the clinical package for the Biologics License Application, or BLA, will be similar to that which formed the basis of approval for Soliris® (eculizumab). We also received agreement from the FDA on our ongoing and planned manufacturing for both the Phase 3 program and commercialization of OMS721 as well as on our nonclinical safety and toxicology plan, most of which has already been successfully completed with no significant adverse findings. We also have an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with TMAs, including aHUS, HSCT-TMA and thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or TTP. Given the Phase 3 clinical trial in aHUS and 
9

positive data in the HSCT-TMA population, the Phase 2 clinical trial protocol in TMAs is being amended to evaluate the effect of OMS721 for the treatment only of HSCT-TMA. We plan to meet with the FDA and other global regulatory agencies in 2017 to advance the HSCT-TMA program into Phase 3.
In addition to our Phase 2 clinical program in patients with TMAs, we are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with IgAN and other complement-associated renal diseases, specifically membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and complement component (C3) glomerulopathy. The ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial is evaluating OMS721 in an open-label cohort covering these four different types of complement-associated kidney diseases as well as in a blinded, placebo-controlled cohort covering patients with IgAN. All patients in the open-label cohort of the trial must have high levels of urinary protein (a marker used by nephrologists to assess disease activity) despite ongoing treatment with a stable corticosteroid dose. These inclusion criteria are intended to ensure that study patients are unlikely to improve spontaneously. In the blinded, controlled cohort evaluating patients with IgAN, patients must have high levels of urinary protein but are not treated with corticosteroids. Patients in the open-label cohort are treated with OMS721 for a total of 12 weeks: four weeks maintaining their entry corticosteroid dose; four weeks of corticosteroid tapering, if tolerated; and four weeks of resultant corticosteroid dose maintenance. Patients are then followed post-treatment for six weeks. Patients in the blinded, controlled cohort are treated with OMS721 or placebo for a total of 12 weeks, then followed post-treatment for six weeks. Based on data to date and discussions with the FDA, we are preparing to initiate a registration program in IgAN.
In addition to TMAs and renal disease, many other disorders have evidence of lectin pathway injury, and we plan to evaluate OMS721 in one or more of them. See “Other Studies” below.
In our OMS721 program, the FDA has granted our drug candidate orphan drug designation for the prevention (inhibition) of complement-mediated TMAs and fast track designation for the treatment of patients with aHUS. We have requested that the FDA grant orphan drug designation for OMS721 in IgAN and have been pursuing fast track designation for OMS721 in this indication. Following discussion with the FDA, we plan to pursue breakthrough therapy designation for OMS721 in IgAN and in HSCT-TMA. We also intend to pursue accelerated approval for OMS721 in both of these indications as well as in aHUS. In addition, we plan to submit for the EMA’s Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program in IgAN and in HSCT-TMA.
Clinical Trial Results Announced in 2016. In October 2016, we announced positive data from the Phase 2 clinical trial of OMS721 for the treatment of complement-associated renal disorders. At the time these data were announced, two patients with IgAN, two patients with membranous nephropathy and two patients with lupus nephritis had completed the trial; no patients with C3 glomerulopathy, an extremely rare disorder, had yet been enrolled. The key efficacy measures in this trial are urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios, or uACRs, throughout the trial and change in 24-hour urine protein levels from baseline to the end of treatment. Data reported from the two IgAN patients then enrolled in the trial demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in uACRs and in 24-hour urine protein from baseline to endpoint. Subsequent data in IgAN patients have been shared with the FDA and, following discussions with the FDA, we plan to pursue breakthrough designation and accelerated approval for this indication. Consistent with earlier clinical trials with OMS721, no significant drug-related safety concerns were observed.
In October 2016, we announced positive results in patients with HSCT-TMA from our Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of OMS721 in TMAs. The HSCT-TMA patients for whom data were reported are adults who had received stem-cell transplantation for hematological malignancies. At the time these data were announced, three HSCT-TMA patients, all of whom had failed immunosuppressive modification, had completed a full course of treatment with OMS721 for up to eight weeks, and two other patients had discontinued OMS721 early in their treatment courses, one of whom later relapsed and treatment for the other was changed to palliative care only. Across all three patients who had completed treatment, mean TMA markers improved over time. Creatinine remained normal or improved, nearly normalizing, in two patients; one did not show improvement in creatinine but was receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. On extended follow up, as reported in October 2016, two patients remained stable and one had experienced graft failure, which the investigator considered unrelated to OMS721 treatment. No significant drug-related safety concerns were observed. Updated data from this patient population, showing consistent benefits to those previously reported, was reported at the combined annual meetings of the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation in February 2017.
We have received requests from investigators and other physicians for expanded access to OMS721. Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use outside of a clinical trial of an investigational medical product and is permitted by the FDA and other regulatory agencies under certain circumstances. OMS721 has been provided to several patients through this program.

Other Studies. We have generated positive preclinical data in in vivo models of AMD, myocardial infarction, diabetic neuropathy, stroke, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and other diseases and disorders.
Licensing Arrangements. We hold worldwide exclusive licenses to rights related to MASP-2, the antibodies targeting MASP-2 and the therapeutic applications for those antibodies from the University of Leicester, from its collaborator, Medical Research Council at Oxford University, or MRC, and from Helion Biotech ApS, or Helion. For a more detailed description of these licenses, see “License and Development Agreements.”
MASP-3 Program - OMS906 - Alternative Pathway Disorders
Overview. As part of our MASP program, we have identified mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-3, or MASP-3, which has been shown to be the key activator of the complement system’s alternative pathway, or APC, and we believe that we are the first to make this and related discoveries associated with the APC. The complement system is part of the immune system’s innate response, and the APC is considered the amplification loop within the complement system. MASP-3 is responsible for the conversion of pro-factor D to factor D, and converted factor D is necessary for the activation of the APC. Based on our alternative pathway-related discoveries, we have expanded our intellectual property position to protect our inventions stemming from these discoveries beyond MASP-2-associated inhibition of the lectin pathway to include inhibition of the alternative pathway. In addition to our MASP-2 inhibitors of the lectin pathway, we are developing inhibitors of the alternative pathway as well as bispecific inhibitors of both the alternative and lectin pathways. For each of these targets, our efforts are directed to both antibody and small-molecule development.
We are currently developing MASP-3 inhibitors for the treatment of disorders related to the APC. We believe that MASP-3 inhibitors may have the potential to treat patients suffering from a wide range of diseases and conditions, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, asthma, traumatic brain injury, AMD, disseminated intravascular coagulation, arthritis, dense deposit disease, aspiration pneumonia, neuromyelitis optica, pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis, endophthalmitis and Behcet’s disease. Currently, we are finalizing selection of our lead and back-up molecules and preparing to initiate scale-up for clinical trials, and are evaluating PNH as the first clinical indication for OMS906.
Preclinical results. In August 2016, we reported positive data from OMS906 in a well-established animal model associated with PNH in which OMS906 significantly improved the survival of red blood cells when compared to control-treated animals and to animals treated with a complement component 5 (C5) inhibitor. Also in August 2016 we reported positive data from OMS906 in a well-established animal model associated with arthritis mediated by the APC.
In November 2016, we announced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the evaluation of OMS906 in non-human primates. Single-dose administration of OMS906 to cynomolgus monkeys resulted in sustained ablation of systemic APC activity for approximately 16 days. The extent of APC ablation was comparable to that achieved by complete inhibition of factor D in vitro, indicating that OMS906 fully blocked the conversion of pro-factor D to factor D. No safety concerns were identified.
Licensing Arrangements. We jointly own and hold worldwide exclusive license rights related to therapeutic applications for inhibiting MASP-3 from the University of Leicester. For a more detailed description of these licenses, see “License and Development Agreements.”
Other Clinical Programs
PDE10 Programs - OMS824 for Huntington’s Disease and Schizophrenia
Overview. Phosphodiesterase 10, or PDE10, is an enzyme that is expressed in areas of the brain strongly linked to diseases that affect cognition, including Huntington’s disease and schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction occurs early in these diseases and is responsible for substantial disability. PDE10 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in multiple animal models of behavior and cognition, and there remain substantial unmet clinical needs with current treatments. Our proprietary compound OMS824 inhibits PDE10 and is being developed in clinical programs for the treatment of cognitive disorders, including Huntington’s disease and schizophrenia. OMS824 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of Huntington’s disease and fast track designation for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with Huntington’s disease. 
Clinical Trials. OMS824 is in a Phase 2 clinical program for the treatment of Huntington’s disease and a Phase 2 clinical program evaluating OMS824 for the treatment of schizophrenia. We are also evaluating other neurological indications for OMS824. Clinical trials in our Huntington’s program are currently subject to dosing limitations. Plans for 
11

continuation of the OMS824 program will be based on internal work ongoing and on discussions with FDA. Clinical trials evaluating OMS824 in schizophrenia are suspended currently at the request of the FDA. Given that there was no active schizophrenia trial at the time of program suspension, the FDA will address the OMS824 schizophrenia program when we have a related trial protocol ready for initiation.
Funding Agreement with The Stanley Medical Research Institute. Our preclinical development of OMS824 was supported by funds from The Stanley Medical Research Institute, or SMRI, a non-profit corporation that supports research on the causes and treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For a more detailed description of our agreement with SMRI, see “License and Development Agreements.”
PPARγ Program - OMS405 
Overview. In our peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, or PPARγ, program, we are developing proprietary compositions that include PPARγ agonists for the treatment and prevention of addiction to substances of abuse, which may include opioids, nicotine and alcohol. We believe that Omeros is the first to demonstrate a link between PPARγ and addiction disorders. Data from clinical studies and from animal models of addiction suggest that PPARγ agonists could be efficacious in the treatment of a wide range of addictions.
Clinical trials. Our collaborators at The New York State Psychiatric Institute have completed two Phase 2 clinical trials related to our PPARγ program. These studies evaluated a PPARγ agonist, alone or in combination with other agents, for treatment of addiction to opioids and to nicotine. The National Institute on Drug Abuse provided substantially all of the funding for these clinical trials and solely oversaw the conduct of these trials. We have the right or expect to be able to reference the data obtained from these studies for subsequent submissions to the FDA and continue to retain all other rights in connection with the PPARγ program. In November 2016, we announced positive data from one of these trials evaluating a PPARγ agonist in heroin users. In October 2016, we also reported positive results (i.e., decreased craving and protection of brain white matter) from a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by an independent investigator evaluating the effects of a PPARγ agonist in patients with cocaine use disorder.
Patent Assignment Agreement with Roberto Ciccocioppo, Ph.D. We acquired the patent applications and related intellectual property rights for our PPARγ program in February 2009 from Roberto Ciccocioppo, Ph.D., of the Università di Camerino, Italy, pursuant to a patent assignment agreement. For a more detailed description of our agreement with Dr. Ciccocioppo, see “License and Development Agreements.”
Preclinical Programs 
PDE7 Program - OMS527 
Overview. Our phosphodiesterase 7, or PDE7, program is based on our discoveries of previously unknown links between PDE7 and any addiction or compulsive disorder and between PDE7 and any movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. PDE7 appears to modulate the dopaminergic system, which plays a significant role in regulating both addiction and movement. We believe that PDE7 inhibitors could be effective therapeutics for the treatment of addiction and compulsive disorders as well as for movement disorders. Data generated in preclinical studies support the use of PDE7 inhibitors in both of these therapeutic areas. We have selected a clinical candidate and are preparing to initiate toxicology studies under good laboratory practices, or GLP, intended to support the submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, or Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, and subsequent clinical trials.
Exclusive License Agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. We hold an exclusive license to certain PDE7 inhibitors claimed in patents and pending patent applications owned by Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (successor-in-interest to Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd.), or Daiichi Sankyo, for use in the treatment of movement, addiction and compulsive disorders as well as other specified indications. For a more detailed description of our agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, see “License and Development Agreements.”
GPCR Platform
Overview. GPCRs comprise one of the largest families of proteins in the genomes of multicellular organisms. It is estimated that there are over 1,000 GPCRs in the human genome, comprising three percent of all human proteins. GPCRs are cell surface membrane proteins involved in mediating both sensory and nonsensory functions. Sensory GPCRs are involved in the perception of light, odors, taste and sexual attractants. Non-sensory GPCRs are involved in metabolism, behavior, reproduction, development, hormonal homeostasis and regulation of the central nervous system. The vast majority of GPCR drug targets are non-sensory. Although GPCRs form a super-family of receptors, individual GPCRs display a high degree of specificity and affinity for the functionally active molecules, or ligands, that bind to a given 
12

receptor. Ligands can either activate the receptor (agonists) or inhibit it (antagonists and inverse agonists). When activated by its ligand, the GPCR interacts with intracellular G proteins, resulting in a cascade of signaling events inside the cell that ultimately leads to the particular function linked to the receptor.
The high degree of specificity and affinity associated with GPCRs has contributed to their becoming the largest family of drug targets for therapeutics against human diseases. It is estimated that nearly 40% of all drugs sold worldwide target GPCRs, yet only 46 GPCRs are responsible for this wealth of drugs. Based on available data, we believe that there are 363 human non-sensory GPCRs, of which approximately 120 have no known ligands, and we refer to those receptors as orphan GPCRs. Without a known ligand, there is no template from which medicinal chemistry efforts can be readily initiated nor a means to identify the GPCR’s signaling pathway and, therefore, drugs are very difficult to develop against orphan GPCRs. “Unlocking” these orphan GPCRs by identifying one or more of their respective ligands could lead to the development of drugs that act at these new targets. To our knowledge, despite efforts by others in the biopharmaceutical industry and academic community, Omeros’ technology is the first commercially viable technology capable of identifying ligands of orphan GPCRs in high throughput.
We have developed a proprietary cellular redistribution assay, or CRA, which we use in a high-throughput manner to identify synthetic ligands, including antagonists, agonists and inverse agonists, that bind to and affect the function of orphan GPCRs. We believe that we are the first to possess the capability to conduct high-throughput drug discovery for orphan GPCRs and that there is no other existing high-throughput technology able to “unlock” orphan GPCRs. We have screened Class A orphan GPCRs against our small-molecule chemical libraries using the CRA. As of February 28, 2017, we had identified and confirmed compounds that interact with 54 of the 81 Class A orphan GPCRs linked to a wide range of indications including cancer as well as metabolic, cardiovascular, immunologic, inflammatory and central nervous system disorders. We are conducting in vivo preclinical efficacy studies and optimizing compounds for a number of targets including: GPR17, linked to myelin formation; GPR101, linked to appetite and eating disorders; GPR151, linked to schizophrenia and cognition; GPR161, which is associated with triple negative breast cancer; GPR183, linked to osteoporosis and to Epstein-Barr virus infections and related diseases; and GPR174, which appears to be involved in the modulation of the immune system and, in particular, of cytokine production and regulatory T cells, or “T-regs,” which are known to be important in autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, in cancer and in organ transplantation.
In December 2016, we announced that our small-molecule inhibitors against GPR174 substantially and statistically significantly boost levels of cytokines and reduce the population of T-regs. In assays with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, evaluating T-cell proliferation and survival following T-cell stimulation, we have discovered that small-molecule GPR174 inhibitors increase, with statistical significance, levels of the cytokines interleukin 2 and interferon gamma multiple-fold and nearly doubled interleukin 10. Moreover, GPR174 inhibition statistically significantly reduced by approximately 40 percent the population of T-regs, a subset of T cells elevated in a large number of cancers. Importantly, the compound effects were not observed in PBMCs derived from mice genetically lacking GPR174, suggesting that the robust compound effects are the result of “on-target” interaction with the orphan receptor. We believe these results demonstrate that GPR174 inhibition potentiates the activity of effector T cells, which produce cytokines and are known to be integral to combatting cancer. Also, reducing the level of T-regs is a key objective in cancer immunotherapy, and high levels of T-regs in solid tumors frequently correlate with poor patient outcomes. In addition, signaling and mechanistic studies support that GPR174 suppresses anti-tumor activity, and inhibitors of GPR174 are expected to counteract that detrimental suppression.
In addition to Class A orphan GPCRs, we have also begun screening orphan and non-orphan Class B receptors. Class B GPCRs have large extracellular domains and their natural ligands are generally large peptides, making the development of orally active, small-molecule drugs against these receptors, such as glucagon and parathyroid hormone, a persistent challenge. Despite the fact that oral agents are not available, the current sales for the commercialized Class B GPCR-targeting peptide drugs are large. Our CRA technology finds functionally active small molecules for GPCRs, which we believe could lead to the development of oral medications for many of the Class B GPCRs. While our focus to date has remained on Class A orphan GPCRs, as of February 28, 2017, we had identified and confirmed sets of compounds that interact selectively with, and modulate signaling of, a small subset of Class B GPCRs, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, or GLP-1R, and parathyroid hormone 1 receptor, or PTH-1R.
GPCR Platform Funding Agreements with Vulcan Inc. and the Life Sciences Discovery Fund. In October 2010, we entered into funding agreements for our GPCR program with Vulcan Inc. and its affiliate, which we refer to collectively as Vulcan, and with the Life Sciences Discovery Fund Authority, a granting agency of the State of Washington, or LSDF. For a more detailed description of these agreements, see “License and Development Agreements.”
Plasmin Program - OMS616 
13

Overview. Our plasmin program is focused on novel antifibrinolytic agents for the control of blood loss during surgery or resulting from trauma as well as for other hyperfibrinolytic states (e.g., liver disease). Excessive bleeding during cardiac or trauma surgery is known to increase overall morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to control this bleeding, patients undergoing cardiac and other extensive surgery often receive antifibrinolytic compounds. These drugs inhibit plasmin, an enzyme present in blood that degrades fibrin clots. Because plasmin degrades fibrin clots, an agent that inhibits plasmin may have potential utility for reducing blood loss due to trauma or surgery. We are currently in the process of evaluating potential indications.
Exclusive License Agreement with The Regents of the University of California. We hold a worldwide exclusive license to patent rights related to certain antifibrinolytics from The Regents of the University of California. For a more detailed description of this agreement, see “License and Development Agreements.”
Antibody Platform
Overview. Our proprietary ex vivo platform for the discovery of novel, high-affinity monoclonal antibodies, which was in-licensed from the University of Washington and then further developed by our scientists, utilizes a chicken B-cell lymphoma cell line. It has successfully generated diverse antibodies that can be readily engineered. This platform offers several advantages over other antibody platforms. The ex vivo immunizations of our proprietary cell line are significantly more rapid than whole animal immunizations and conventional hybridoma technology. By avoiding immunization of mice or other animals, we believe the antibodies we generate from this platform are not limited by immunological tolerance. In addition, our platform is capable of producing novel antibodies against difficult targets, such as highly homologous proteins, enzymes, and receptors with short extracellular domains. Chicken antibodies also have unique features that enable binding capabilities distinct from mammalian antibodies.
We have generated antibodies to several clinically significant targets, including highly potent antibodies against MASP-3 and MASP-1, and our platform continues to add to our pipeline antibodies against additional important targets.
Asset Purchase Agreement with Xori Corporation. In February 2012 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Xori APA, with Xori Corporation, or Xori, pursuant to which we acquired all of Xori’s rights and obligations in certain license and material transfer agreements, intellectual property, antibodies and other assets related to our antibody platform. We are obligated to make development and research-related milestone payments to Xori.
Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Washington. We hold a worldwide exclusive license to patent rights related to our antibody platform from the University of Washington. For a more detailed description of this agreement, see “License and Development Agreements.”
PharmacoSurgery® Platform 
We believe that current standards of care for the management and treatment of surgical trauma are limited in effectiveness. Surgical trauma causes a complex cascade of molecular signaling and biochemical changes, resulting in inflammation, pain, pupil constriction, muscle spasm, loss of function and other problems. As a consequence, multiple pharmacologic actions are required to manage the complexity and inherent redundancy of the cascade. Accordingly, we believe that single-agent treatments acting on single targets do not result in optimal therapeutic benefit. We generate from our PharmacoSurgery platform proprietary products, such as OMIDRIA and product candidates discussed below, that are combinations of therapeutic agents designed to act simultaneously at multiple discrete targets to block preemptively the molecular-signaling and biochemical cascade caused by surgical trauma and to provide clinical benefits both during and after surgery. These products and product candidates are supplied in pre-dosed, pre-formulated, single-use containers and added to standard surgical irrigation solutions, delivered intraoperatively to the site of tissue trauma throughout the surgical procedure. This is expected to result in the delivery of low concentrations of agents with minimal systemic uptake and reduced risk of adverse side effects and does not require a surgeon to change his or her operating routine.
OMS103-Arthroscopy. OMS103, part of our PharmacoSurgery platform, was developed for use during all arthroscopic procedures, including knee and shoulder arthroscopy, and completed Phase 3 trials in patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. OMS103 is a proprietary combination of anti-inflammatory/analgesic APIs, specifically amitriptyline, ketoprofen and oxymetazoline, each with well-known safety and pharmacologic profiles, and was designed to provide a multimodal approach to block preemptively the inflammatory cascade induced by arthroscopy. All of the APIs are components of generic, FDA-approved drugs that have been marketed in the U.S. as over-the-counter or prescription drug products for over 20 years and have established and well-characterized safety profiles. In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement, or the OMS103 Agreement, with Fagron Compounding Services, LLC, d/b/a Fagron Sterile Services, and JCB Laboratories, LLC, or 
14

collectively Fagron, an FDA-registered human drug outsourcing facility, under which Fagron is obligated to produce under Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, and to commercialize OMS103 in the U.S. Fagron has not met its performance diligence obligations under the OMS103 Agreement, including initiating sales, and we do not expect them to do so in the near term. We are currently evaluating our options regarding the OMS103 Agreement and our OMS103 program. For a more detailed description of this agreement, see “License and Development Agreements.”
OMS201-Urology. OMS201 is our PharmacoSurgery product candidate designed for use during urological procedures, including ureterscopy for removal of ureteral or renal stones. OMS201 is a proprietary combination of ketoprofen, an anti-inflammatory API, and nifedipine, a smooth muscle relaxant API. Each API is contained in generic, FDA-approved drugs that have been marketed in the U.S. for more than 20 years and have well-known safety and pharmacologic profiles. Both of these APIs have been individually prescribed to manage the symptoms of ureteral and renal stones. In 2010, we completed a Phase 1/Phase 2 clinical trial in 24 patients designed to evaluate the safety and systemic absorption of two sequentially higher concentrations of OMS201 added to standard irrigation solution and delivered to patients undergoing ureteroscopy for removal of ureteral or renal stones. OMS201 was well tolerated in this study. The next step in our OMS201 program is to design a Phase 2 clinical program; however, the program is suspended given current availability of clinical development resources. We are evaluating alternative approaches to make OMS201 commercially available, such as through a registered outsourcing facility without the need to conduct any additional clinical trials.
Sales and Marketing
Overview. We have retained all worldwide marketing and distribution rights to OMIDRIA, our product candidates and our development programs, other than OMS103. This allows us the opportunity to market and sell independently OMIDRIA or, if approved, any of our product candidates, to make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us, or both. 
OMIDRIA. With respect to OMIDRIA, we have developed our own internal marketing and sales capabilities and, as of February 28, 2017, employ 45 sales and reimbursement team members who are focused on the U.S. market. We also use the services of Precision Lens under a commission-only arrangement to cover territories in the Midwest that are not covered by our in-house sales force. Because surgeons specializing in cataract surgery are a sub-specialty within ophthalmology, we believe that we can effectively access high-volume surgeons with our existing sales organization and the services of third-party sales agents such as Precision Lens in certain territories in the U.S. 
In the EU, we plan to out-license OMIDRIA marketing and distribution rights to one or more third parties that have capabilities to promote to ophthalmologic surgeons, to facilitate distribution and reimbursement, and to manage pharmacovigilance and clinical support. For the EU OMIDRIA marketing authorization to remain valid, product must be placed on the market (i.e., released into the distribution chain) in at least one EEA country by July 28, 2018. Outside of the U.S. and EU, we have the ITROM Agreement for certain countries in the Middle East and we are exploring additional potential regional partnerships to make OMIDRIA available to ophthalmologists. Other than the ITROM Agreement, we have not yet entered into any agreements with third parties to market OMIDRIA outside of the U.S. If we are unable to enter into one or more such agreements on terms acceptable to us, we would not expect to see sales of OMIDRIA in those territories.
OMS103. Our OMS103 Agreement with Fagron requires Fagron to meet performance diligence requirements including to bear all sales and marketing costs for U.S. sales. We have retained marketing and distribution rights for OMS103 outside of the U.S. Fagron has not performed its performance diligence obligations under the OMS103 Agreement, including initiating sales, and we do not expect it to do so in the near term. For a more detailed description of our agreement with Fagron and Fagron’s non-performance, see “License and Development Agreements.”
Manufacturing, Supply and Commercial Operations
OMIDRIA. We use third parties to produce, store and distribute OMIDRIA and currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. Our agreements with these third parties include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to OMIDRIA. We require manufacturers that produce APIs and finished drug products to operate in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. 
We have agreements with Hospira Worldwide, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc., or Hospira, and with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC (successor-in-interest to DSM Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), or Patheon, to provide commercial supply of OMIDRIA. We are currently completing the process to have Hospira approved by the FDA as a 
15

manufacturing site for OMIDRIA. Until this process is complete, Hospira may not manufacture and supply OMIDRIA. We expect that OMIDRIA manufacturing will be approved for production at Hospira in mid-2017. Commercial manufacturing of OMIDRIA under our agreement with Patheon, or the Patheon Agreement, ceased on December 31, 2015 in accordance with the terms of the Patheon Agreement with the exception of the final delivery of product as further described in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations and Commitments.” We anticipated this interruption in manufacturing and increased production of OMIDRIA prior to the break in manufacturing. We believe that we will have sufficient supply to meet product needs until OMIDRIA product production is recommenced.
Under the agreement with Hospira, or the Hospira OMIDRIA Agreement, Hospira has agreed to manufacture and supply, and we have agreed to purchase, a minimum percentage of our requirements of OMIDRIA for commercial sales and clinical supplies for the development of additional therapeutic indications in the U.S. In addition, Hospira has agreed to manufacture and supply a portion of our requirements of OMIDRIA in the EU in an amount to be mutually agreed by the parties (not to exceed a maximum percentage of our EU requirements), with there being no minimum purchase and supply requirement in the EU if the parties do not reach agreement during such time period and the agreement is not amended thereafter. The Hospira OMIDRIA Agreement has an initial term of five years from the date of first commercial sale of OMIDRIA in the U.S. or in any country in the EU, and thereafter is renewed automatically for up to two additional one-year periods. The Hospira OMIDRIA Agreement may be terminated prior to the end of its term upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including without limitation an uncured breach of the agreement or bankruptcy or dissolution of a party. Upon termination of the Hospira OMIDRIA Agreement, except in the case of termination for an uncured breach by Hospira, we will be required to purchase all of Hospira’s inventory of OMIDRIA and, if applicable, all work-in-progress inventory and to reimburse Hospira for all supplies purchased or ordered based on firm purchase orders or our estimates of its requirements of OMIDRIA.
We have used multiple suppliers for the APIs for OMIDRIA in the past and we intend to leverage Hospira’s sourcing of APIs in the future under the Hospira OMIDRIA Agreement. Given the large amount of these APIs manufactured annually by these and other suppliers, and the quantities of these APIs we have on hand, we anticipate that we will be capable of addressing our commercial API supply needs for OMIDRIA. We have not yet signed commercial agreements with suppliers for the supply of all of our anticipated commercial quantities of these APIs for OMIDRIA, although we may elect to do so in the future.
In the U.S., we sell OMIDRIA through a limited number of wholesalers that distribute the product to ASCs and hospitals. Title transfers upon delivery of OMIDRIA to the wholesaler. We use a single third-party logistics provider to handle warehousing of our commercial supply of OMIDRIA in the U.S. and to ship OMIDRIA to our wholesalers. Our third-party logistics provider also performs certain support services on our behalf. Nearly all of our revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were generated from OMIDRIA product sales in the U.S. Three of our major distributors - AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation - together with entities under their common control each accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2016.
Product Candidates and OMS103. We have laboratories in-house for analytical method development, bioanalytical testing, formulation, stability testing and small-scale compounding of laboratory supplies of product candidates. We utilize contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of product candidates for use in preclinical and clinical studies and to store and distribute our product candidates, and we currently do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for our product candidates. We require manufacturers that produce APIs and finished drug products for clinical use to operate in accordance with cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. We anticipate that we will rely on contract manufacturers to develop and manufacture our product candidates for commercial sale. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. We have not yet entered into a commercial supply agreement for any of our product candidates, although we intend to do so prior to the applicable product candidate’s commercial launch. Given the nature of the manufacturing processes of our product candidates, we anticipate that we will be capable of identifying contract manufacturers to produce these product candidates and of entering into agreements for the commercial supply of these drugs.
In connection with the OMS103 Agreement, we terminated our agreement with Hospira pursuant to which Hospira had agreed to manufacture and supply our commercial requirements of liquid OMS103. The OMS103 Agreement obligates Fagron to meet performance diligence requirements, including to bear all sales and marketing costs for U.S. sales of OMS103; however, Fagron has not performed its performance diligence obligations under the OMS103 Agreement. For a description of the OMS103 Agreement and Fagron’s non-performance, see “License and Development Agreements.”
16

License and Development Agreements
OMS103. In June 2015, we entered into the OMS103 Agreement under which Fagron is obligated to manufacture and commercialize OMS103. Pursuant to the OMS103 Agreement, we granted Fagron an exclusive, royalty-free license to the OMS103 intellectual property, manufacturing information and clinical data to produce, on a large-scale registered basis, and commercialize OMS103 in the United States. If OMS103 is commercialized under the terms of the OMS103 Agreement, we would be eligible to receive payments representing a substantial majority share of gross revenue from future OMS103 product sales within the United States, which revenue share will not be less than a minimum per unit amount. Additionally, we would be eligible to receive up to an aggregate total of $10 million in potential payments upon the achievement of specific commercial milestones and as revenue-share enhancement on early sales. The OMS103 Agreement obligates Fagron to produce under GMP and to commercialize OMS103 in the U.S. Unless terminated earlier, the OMS103 Agreement will continue in effect until expiration of the last-to-expire of the patents in the licensed intellectual property or as otherwise provided under the terms of the OMS103 Agreement. Either party may terminate the OMS103 Agreement earlier if the other party materially breaches the OMS103 Agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period or upon the other party’s insolvency. Additionally, we may terminate the OMS103 Agreement earlier if Fagron does not meet its performance diligence requirements, in response to a negative action by a regulatory authority, or if Fagron opposes or challenges any of the licensed patents for OMS103. 
Fagron has not met its performance diligence obligations under the OMS103 Agreement, including initiating sales, and we do not expect them to do so in the near term. We are evaluating our options regarding the OMS103 Agreement and our OMS103 program.
MASP Program. Under our exclusive license agreements with the University of Leicester and MRC, we have agreed to pay royalties to each of the University of Leicester and MRC that are a percentage of any proceeds we receive from the licensed MASP-2 technology during the terms of the agreements. Our exclusive license agreement with the University of Leicester, but not our agreement with the MRC, also applies to other MASPs. The continued maintenance of these agreements requires us to undertake development activities. We must pay low single-digit percentage royalties with respect to proceeds that we receive from products incorporating the licensed technology that are used, manufactured, directly sold or directly distributed by us, and we must pay royalties, in the range of a low single-digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage, with respect to proceeds we receive from sublicense royalties or fees that we receive from third parties to which we grant sublicenses to the licensed technology. We did not make any upfront payments for these exclusive licenses nor are there any milestone payments or reversion rights associated with these license agreements. We also agreed to sponsor research of MASP-2 at these institutions at pre-determined rates for maximum terms of approximately three years. We have agreed to expand the scope of research at the University of Leicester to MASP-3 and have continued the sponsorship of research at the University of Leicester on a year-by-year basis. If mutually agreed, we may sponsor additional research related to MASP-2 at MRC, and to MASP-2 and MASP-3 at the University of Leicester. We retain worldwide exclusive licenses from these institutions to develop and commercialize any intellectual property rights developed in the sponsored research. The term of each license agreement ends when there are no longer any pending patent applications, applications in preparation or unexpired issued patents related to any of the intellectual property rights we are licensing under the agreement. Both of these license agreements may be terminated prior to the end of their terms by us for convenience or by one party if the other party (1) breaches any material obligation under the agreement and does not cure such breach after notice and an opportunity to cure or (2) is declared or adjudged to be insolvent, bankrupt or in receivership and materially limited from performing its obligations under the agreement.
In April 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Helion Biotech ApS, or Helion, pursuant to which we received a royalty-bearing, worldwide exclusive license to all of Helion’s intellectual property rights related to MASP-2 antibodies, polypeptides and methods in the field of inhibition of mannan-binding lectin-mediated activation of the complement system for the prevention, treatment or diagnosis of any disease or condition. We are obligated to make remaining development and sales milestone payments to Helion of up to $6.1 million upon the achievement of certain events, such as the filing of an IND with the FDA, initiation of Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, receipt of marketing approval, and reaching specified sales milestones. We are obligated to pay Helion a low single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of a MASP-2 inhibitor product covered by the patents licensed under the agreement. The term of the agreement continues so long as there is a valid, subsisting and enforceable claim in any patents or patent applications covered by the agreement. The agreement may be terminated sooner by either party following a material breach of the agreement by the other party that has not been cured within 90 days.
OMS824. We have agreed to pay royalties to SMRI based on any net income we receive from sales of a PDE10 product until we have paid a maximum aggregate amount that is a low single-digit multiple of the amount of grant funding that we have received from SMRI. This multiple increases as time elapses from the date we received the grant funding. There are no minimum payment obligations under our agreement with SMRI. Based on the amount of grant funding that 
17

we received from SMRI, the maximum amount of royalties payable to SMRI is $12.8 million and payment is required only from any net income, after all related expenses, that we receive from sales of a PDE10 product. The funding agreement and our obligation to pay a royalty to SMRI terminate when we have repaid such amount in the form of royalties.
PPARγ. We acquired the patent applications and related intellectual property rights for our PPARγ program in February 2009 from Roberto Ciccocioppo, Ph.D. of the Università di Camerino, Italy, pursuant to a patent assignment agreement. In February 2011, we amended the agreement to include all intellectual property rights, including patent applications, related to nutraceuticals that increase PPARγ activity. Under the amended agreement, we have agreed to pay Dr. Ciccocioppo a low-single digit percentage royalty on net sales of any products that are covered by any patents that issue from the patent applications that we acquired from him. In addition, if we grant any third parties rights to manufacture, sell or distribute any such products, we must pay to Dr. Ciccocioppo a percentage of any associated fees we receive from such third parties in the range of low single-digits to low double-digits depending on the stage of development at which such rights are granted. We have also agreed to make total milestone payments of up to $3.8 million to Dr. Ciccocioppo upon the occurrence of certain development events, such as patient enrollment in a Phase 1 clinical trial and receipt of marketing approval of a product candidate covered by any patents that issue from the patent applications that we acquired from him. If we notify Dr. Ciccocioppo that we have abandoned all research and development and commercialization efforts related to the patent applications and intellectual property rights we acquired from him, Dr. Ciccocioppo has the right to repurchase those assets from us at a price equal to a double-digit percentage of our direct and indirect financial investments and expenditures in such assets. If he does not exercise his right to repurchase those assets within a limited period of time by paying the purchase price, we will have no further obligations to sell those assets to Dr. Ciccocioppo. The term of our agreement with Dr. Ciccocioppo ends when there are no longer any valid and enforceable patents related to the intellectual property rights we acquired from him, provided that either party may terminate the agreement earlier in case of an uncured breach by the other party. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay a portion of the payments due to Dr. Ciccocioppo to the Università di Camerino without any increase to our payment obligations. 
PDE7. Under an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, we hold an exclusive worldwide license to PDE7 inhibitors claimed in certain patents and pending patent applications owned by Daiichi Sankyo for use in the treatment of (1) movement disorders and other specified indications, (2) addiction and compulsive disorders and (3) all other diseases except those related to dermatologic conditions. Under the agreement, we agreed to make milestone payments to Daiichi Sankyo of up to an aggregate total of $33.5 million upon the achievement of certain events in each of these three fields; however, if only one of the three indications is advanced through the milestones, the total milestone payments would be $23.5 million. The milestone payment events include successful completion of preclinical toxicology studies; dosing of human subjects in Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials; receipt of marketing approval of a PDE7 inhibitor product candidate; and reaching specified sales milestones. In addition, Daiichi Sankyo is entitled to receive from us a low single-digit percentage royalty of any net sales of a PDE7 inhibitor licensed under the agreement by us and/or our sublicensee(s) provided that, if the sales are made by a sublicensee, then the amount payable by us to Daiichi Sankyo is capped at an amount equal to a low double-digit percentage of all royalty and specified milestone payments received by us from the sublicensee. 
The term of the agreement with Daiichi Sankyo continues so long as there is a valid, subsisting and enforceable claim in any patents covered by the agreement. The agreement may be terminated sooner by us, with or without cause, upon 90 days advance written notice or by either party following a material breach of the agreement by the other party that has not been cured within 90 days or immediately if the other party is insolvent or bankrupt. Daiichi Sankyo also has the right to terminate the agreement if we and our sublicensee(s) cease to conduct all research, development and/or commercialization activities for a PDE7 inhibitor covered by the agreement for a period of six consecutive months, in which case all rights held by us under Daiichi Sankyo’s patents will revert to Daiichi Sankyo.
GPCR Platform Funding Agreements with Vulcan Inc. and the Life Sciences Discovery Fund. In October 2010, we entered into funding agreements for our GPCR program with Vulcan and LSDF. We received $20.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, under the agreements with Vulcan and LSDF. Under these agreements, we have agreed to pay Vulcan and LSDF tiered percentages of the net proceeds, if any, that we derive from the GPCR program. The percentage rates of net proceeds payable to Vulcan and LSDF decrease as the cumulative net proceeds reach specified thresholds, and the blended percentage rate payable to Vulcan and LSDF in the aggregate is in the mid-teens with respect to the first approximately $1.5 billion of cumulative net proceeds that we receive from our GPCR program. If we receive cumulative net proceeds in excess of approximately $1.5 billion, the percentage rate payable to Vulcan and LSDF in the aggregate decreases to one percent. An acquirer of the assets in our GPCR program may be required, and an acquirer of our company would be required, to assume all of our payment and other obligations under our agreements with Vulcan and LSDF.
Under our agreement with Vulcan, we granted Vulcan a security interest in our personal property related to the GPCR program, other than intellectual property, which security interest is junior to any existing or future security interests granted 
18

in connection with a financing transaction and which will be released automatically after Vulcan receives $25.0 million under the agreement. We also agreed not to grant any liens on intellectual property related to the GPCR program without Vulcan’s consent, subject to specified exceptions. These restrictions could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities involving the GPCR program or reduce the price for which a potential buyer would pay for the GPCR assets. If we default under our agreement with Vulcan, in certain circumstances Vulcan may, subject to the rights of any holders of senior security interests, take control of such pledged assets. If we are liquidated, Vulcan’s right to receive any payments then due under our agreement would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation of our GPCR program assets.
The term of our agreement with Vulcan is 35 years, provided that the term will automatically extend until the cumulative net proceeds that we receive from the GPCR program are approximately $1.5 billion. The term of our agreement with LSDF expires on the six-month anniversary following the last date that we deliver a report related to our incurrence of grant-funded expenses described in the agreement, provided that certain obligations will survive the expiration of the term. The term of our payment obligations to LSDF is the same as that under our agreement with Vulcan.
OMS616. On December 14, 2010, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, pursuant to which we received an exclusive license to a series of antifibrinolytic agents claimed in certain patents owned by The Regents of the University of California in exchange for our agreement to make royalty and development milestone payments.
Antibody Platform. We hold a worldwide exclusive license to patent rights related to our antibody platform from the University of Washington, or UW. Pursuant to the Xori APA, we acquired all of Xori’s exclusive rights under a license agreement with the UW to certain patents and patent applications related to our antibody platform owned by the UW in exchange for our agreement to make royalty and development milestone payments to UW.
Competition
Overview. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies as well as smaller companies like ours. We expect to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and our competitors may:

• | develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective or safer than our future products;


• | commercialize competing products before we can launch our products;


• | operate larger research and development programs, possess greater manufacturing capabilities or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;


• | initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;


• | have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;


• | more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and


• | take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.

We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. In addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because our research approach integrates many technologies, it may be difficult for us to remain current with the rapid changes in each technology. Further, our competitors may render our technologies obsolete by advancing their existing technological approaches or developing new or different approaches. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively.
OMIDRIA. We are not aware of any FDA-approved products comprised of two or more APIs that directly compete with OMIDRIA that are approved for intraoperative delivery in irrigation solutions during surgical procedures; however, OMIDRIA could compete with single API products that are delivered intraoperatively as well as preoperative and postoperative treatments for mydriasis, pain or inflammation. Our primary competition for OMIDRIA comes from surgeons’ current practices, which may include use of products obtained from distributors or compounding pharmacies at a relatively low cost. In addition, we anticipate that there are some surgeons who do not use intraoperative mydriatics and may not agree with the value proposition of maintaining pupil dilation and inhibiting miosis during the procedure or with the use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intraoperatively to reduce inflammation and postoperative pain. Although 
19

we are not aware of any companies developing similar combination approaches for maintenance of intraoperative pupil size and postoperative pain reduction, such strategies may develop.
As described above, Par filed an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV Certification seeking approval to market a generic version of OMIDRIA prior to the expiration of the Orange Book Patents. An adverse outcome in our patent infringement lawsuit filed against Par following receipt of Par’s Notice Letter regarding the Paragraph IV Certification could, among other things, result in a generic version of OMIDRIA being launched after the expiration of the mandatory three-year clinical data exclusivity for OMIDRIA, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In the future, other manufacturers may potentially file ANDAs seeking approval for the sale of generic versions of OMIDRIA before our relevant patents expire, or generic manufacturers may challenge one or more of the patents using U.S. Patent and Trademark Office procedures. For more information regarding the ANDA filed by Par and our patent infringement lawsuit against Par, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
Product Candidates. Our clinical and preclinical product candidates may face competing products. With respect to our complement program, Soliris® is a monoclonal complement inhibitor administered intravenously and approved for commercial use that will compete with our lead MASP-2 inhibitor OMS721, and/or our MASP-3 inhibitor OMS906, if either is approved for any indication(s) for which Soliris® is also approved. We are also aware of two Soliris® biosimilar antibodies that are in development. Alexion, the manufacturer of Soliris®, has announced follow-on antibodies that are directed to the Soliris® target, but which will require less frequent dosing than Soliris® or that can be administered subcutaneously. With respect to our PDE10 inhibitor program, we are developing PDE10 inhibitors for use in the treatment of Huntington’s disease, schizophrenia and other diseases that affect cognition. Other pharmaceutical companies, many with significantly greater resources than we have, are also developing, or may develop, PDE10 inhibitors for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, schizophrenia and other diseases that affect cognition, and these companies may be further along in development. Recently, Pfizer announced negative results in a clinical trial of a PDE10 inhibitor for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. Also, Pfizer has announced negative results from schizophrenia trials with a PDE10 inhibitor and Takeda Pharmaceuticals has announced that the primary endpoint was not met in a clinical trial of a different PDE10 inhibitor in a schizophrenia trial. In addition, we are aware of other companies attempting to de-orphanize orphan GPCRs. If any of these companies is able to de-orphanize an orphan GPCR before we do, we may be unable to establish an exclusive or commercially valuable intellectual property position around that orphan GPCR. We are not aware of any FDA-approved products comprised of two or more APIs that directly compete with any of our PharmacoSurgery product candidates that are approved for intraoperative delivery in irrigation solutions during surgical procedures; however, a product candidate could compete with single API products that are delivered intraoperatively as well as preoperative and postoperative treatments for inflammation and/or other conditions. 
Intellectual Property 
As of February 28, 2017, we owned or held worldwide exclusive licenses to a total of 63 issued patents and 73 pending patent applications in the U.S. and 492 issued patents and 313 pending patent applications in foreign markets directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our development programs. For each program, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including one or more of the following: our available resources, the size of the commercial market, the presence of a potential competitor or a contract manufacturer in the market and whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights.

• | OMIDRIA-Ophthalmology. OMIDRIA is encompassed by our PharmacoSurgery patent portfolio. The relevant patents and patent applications in this portfolio are directed to combinations of agents, generic and/or proprietary to us or to others, drawn from therapeutic classes such as pain and inflammation inhibitory agents, mydriatic agents and agents that reduce intraocular pressure, delivered locally and intraoperatively to the site of ophthalmological procedures, including cataract and lens replacement surgery. As of February 28, 2017, we owned six issued U.S. patents and four pending U.S. patent applications and 36 issued patents and 46 pending patent applications in foreign markets that are directed to OMIDRIA.

Our OMS201 patents have terms that will expire as late as July 16, 2029 and, if currently pending patent applications are issued, as late as March 17, 2026.

All of our employees enter into our standard employee proprietary information and inventions agreement, which includes confidentiality provisions and provides us ownership of all inventions and other intellectual property made by our employees that pertain to our business or that relate to our employees’ work for us or that result from the use of our resources. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of the use, formulation and structure of our products and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as on our ability to defend successfully these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to protect our products and product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing by third parties is dependent on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these 
21

activities. In addition, we have granted a lien on substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property, to the administrative agent under the CRG Loan Agreement.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S., and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that we own or have licensed or in third-party patents.
We have retained control of all worldwide manufacturing, marketing and distribution rights for OMIDRIA and each of our product candidates and programs (other than OMS103). Some of our products and product candidates and programs are based on inventions and other intellectual property rights that we acquired through assignments, exclusive licenses or acquisitions.

• | PharmacoSurgery Platform. Our scientific co-founders, Gregory A. Demopulos, M.D. and Pamela Pierce Palmer, M.D., Ph.D., conceived the initial invention underlying our PharmacoSurgery platform and transferred all of their related intellectual property rights to us in 1994. Other than their rights as shareholders, our scientific co-founders have not retained any rights to our PharmacoSurgery platform, except that if we file for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act or voluntarily liquidate or dissolve, other than in connection with a merger, reorganization, consolidation or sale of assets, our scientific co-founders have the right to repurchase the initial PharmacoSurgery intellectual property at its then-current fair market value. Subsequent developments of the PharmacoSurgery intellectual property were assigned to us by Dr. Demopulos, Dr. Palmer and other of our employees and consultants, without restriction.


• | MASP Program. We hold worldwide exclusive licenses to rights related to MASP-2, the antibodies targeting MASP-2 and the therapeutic applications for the antibodies from the University of Leicester, MRC and Helion. We jointly own and hold worldwide exclusive license rights related to therapeutic applications for inhibiting MASP-3 from the University of Leicester. For more detailed descriptions of these licenses, see “License and Development Agreements.”


• | PDE10 and PDE7 Programs. We acquired our PDE10 and PDE7 programs and some of our related patents and other intellectual property rights as a result of our acquisition of nura, inc. We hold an exclusive license to certain PDE7 inhibitors claimed in patents and pending patent applications owned by Daiichi Sankyo for use in the treatment of movement, addiction and compulsive disorders as well as other specified indications. For a more detailed description of our agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, see “License and Development Agreements.”


• | PPARγ Program. We acquired the patent applications and related intellectual property rights for our PPARγ program in 2009 from Roberto Ciccocioppo, Ph.D., of the Università di Camerino, Italy, pursuant to a patent assignment agreement. For a more detailed description of this agreement, see “License and Development Agreements.”


• | GPCR Platform. We acquired our GPCR program and some of our related patents and other intellectual property rights as a result of our acquisition of nura, inc. In November of 2010 we acquired intellectual property rights related to an assay technology for our GPCR program from Patobios Limited for approximately $10.8 million.


• | Plasmin Program. We hold a worldwide exclusive license to patent rights related to certain antifibrinolytics from The Regents of the University of California. For a more detailed description of this agreement, see “License and Development Agreements.”


• | Antibody Platform. We hold a worldwide exclusive license to patent rights related to our antibody platform from the UW. For a more detailed description of this agreement, see “License and Development Agreements.

 Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the U.S., the EU and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, and export and import of drug and biologic products such as those we are developing. Failure to comply with applicable requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us, our third-party manufacturers, and other partners to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, a delay in approving or refusal to approve 
22

pending applications, civil and other monetary penalties, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions.
In the U.S., our products and product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs or biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations and, in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act. In Europe, our products and product candidates are regulated by the EMA and national medicines regulators under the rules governing medicinal products in the EU as well as national regulations in individual countries. OMIDRIA has received marketing approval from the FDA and from the applicable regulatory authorities in the EU. Our product candidates are in various stages of testing and none of our product candidates, nor OMS103, has received marketing approval from the FDA or the applicable regulatory authorities in the EU.
The steps required before a product may be approved for marketing by the FDA or the applicable regulatory authorities typically include the following:

• | formulation development and manufacturing process development;


• | preclinical laboratory and animal testing;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; and in Europe, a CTA is filed according to the country’s local regulations;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of the product for each indication for which approval is sought;


• | adequate assessment of drug product stability to determine shelf life/expiry dating;


• | in Europe, submission to the EMA or national regulatory authority of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and in the U.S., submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the case of a drug product, or a BLA in the case of a biologic product;


• | satisfactory completion of inspections of clinical sites at which clinical trials with the product were carried out and of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, and cGMP; and


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA, or review and approval of an MAA by the applicable regulatory authorities in the EU.

Manufacturing. Manufacturing of drug products for use in clinical trials must be conducted according to relevant national guidelines, for example, cGMP. Process and formulation development are undertaken to design suitable routes to manufacture the drug substance and the drug product for administration to animals or humans. Analytical development is undertaken to obtain methods to quantify the potency, purity and stability of the drug substance and drug product as well as to measure the amount of the drug substance and its metabolites in biological fluids, such as the blood.
Preclinical Tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, clinical development plan, and other available information are submitted as part of an IND or CTA.
The IND/CTA Process. An IND or CTA must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions and imposes a clinical hold. In that event, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before the clinical hold is lifted and clinical trials can proceed. Similarly, a CTA must be cleared by the local independent ethics committee and competent authority prior to conducting a clinical trial in the European country in which it was submitted. This process can take from two weeks to several months. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND or CTA will result in authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND or CTA is in effect, there are certain reporting requirements. 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified personnel and must be conducted in accordance with local regulations and cGCP. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, for example, the parameters to be used in monitoring patient safety and the efficacy criteria, or endpoints, to be evaluated. Each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board or ethics committee for each clinical site at which the trial will be conducted before it can begin. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational product to human subjects, who may or may not have the disease or condition for which the product is being developed, to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacodynamics and, if possible, to gain an early indication of the effectiveness of the product.

23


• | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population with the disease or condition for which the product is being developed to evaluate appropriate dosage, to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and to evaluate preliminarily the effectiveness of the product for specific indications.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate and confirm effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the product in its final form in an expanded patient population.

We, our product development partners, institutional review boards or ethics committees, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
The Application Process. If the necessary clinical trials are successfully completed, the results of the preclinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or a BLA, as applicable, and to the EMA or national regulators in the form of an MAA, requesting approval to market the product for a specified indication. In the EU, an MAA may be submitted to the EMA for review and, if the EMA gives a positive opinion, the EC may grant a marketing authorization that is valid across the EU (centralized procedure). Alternatively, an MAA may be submitted to one or more national regulators in the EU according to one of several national or decentralized procedures. The type of submission in Europe depends on various factors and must be cleared by the appropriate authority prior to submission. For most of our product candidates, the centralized procedure will be either mandatory or available as an option.
If the regulatory authority determines that the application is not acceptable, it may refuse to accept the application for filing and review, outlining the deficiencies in the application and specifying additional information needed to file the application. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional testing or information, the regulatory authority ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Before approving an NDA or BLA, or an MAA, the FDA or the EMA, respectively, may inspect the clinical sites at which the Phase 3 study(ies) were conducted to assure that GCPs were followed and may inspect facility(ies) at which the product is manufactured to assure satisfactory compliance with cGMP. After approval, changes to the approved product such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims will require submission of a supplemental application or, in some instances, a new application, for further review and approval. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any future approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Some of our drug products may be eligible for submission to the FDA of NDAs for approval under the Section 505(b)(2) process. Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification, such as a new indication or new dosage form, of a previously approved drug. Section 505(b)(2) applications may rely on the FDA’s previous findings for the safety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug in addition to information obtained by the 505(b)(2) applicant to support the modification of the previously approved drug. Preparing Section 505(b)(2) applications may be less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information.
The FDA regulates certain of our products and product candidates, such as OMIDRIA and OMS103, as fixed-dose combination drugs under its Combination Drug Policy (21 CFR Section 300.50) because they are comprised of two or more active ingredients. In addition to demonstrating that the drug product is safe and effective, the FDA’s Combination Drug Policy requires that we demonstrate that each active ingredient in a drug product contributes to the product’s effectiveness. The EMA has a similar Guideline for fixed-dose combination products. Satisfaction of the U.S. or EU requirements for fixed-dose combination products may involve substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that work conducted to satisfy these requirements will be deemed acceptable by the applicable regulatory authority.
Some of our product candidates, such as those from our MASP-2, MASP-3 and Plasmin programs, are considered biologics because they are derived from natural sources as opposed to being chemically synthesized. The added complexity associated with manufacturing biologics may result in additional monitoring of the manufacturing process and product changes.
In addition, we, our suppliers, and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with extensive FDA and EMA requirements both before and after approval. For example, we must establish a pharmacovigilance system and are required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the regulatory authorities. We must also comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. The regulatory authorities may impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization, such as additional safety monitoring, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-marketing safety studies. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMPs. In addition, discovery of 
24

problems such as safety issues may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or marketing authorization holder, including removal of the product from the market.
Fast Track and Priority Review Designations. Section 506(b) of the FDCA provides for the designation of a drug as a fast track product if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. A program with fast track status is afforded greater access to the FDA for the purpose of expediting the product’s development, review and potential approval. Many products that receive fast track designation are also considered appropriate to receive priority review, and their respective applications may be accepted by the FDA as a rolling submission in which portions of an NDA are reviewed before the complete application is submitted. Together, these may reduce time of development and FDA review time. In Europe, products that are considered to be of major public health interest are eligible for accelerated assessment, which shortens the review period substantially. The grant of fast track status, priority review or accelerated assessment does not alter the standard regulatory requirements for obtaining marketing approval, however.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation. In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. The EU has a similar program, referred to as PRIME, to that of the U.S., and it is administered through the EMA. This offers early and proactive support to medicine developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of medicines applications.
Accelerated Approval. The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require certain adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit of the product, and may impose restrictions on distribution to assure safe use. Post-marketing studies would usually be required to be studies already underway at the time of the accelerated approval. If the required post-marketing studies fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug, or if the applicant fails to perform the required post-marketing studies with due diligence, the FDA may withdraw approval of the drug under streamlined procedures in accordance with the agency’s regulations. The agency may also withdraw approval of a drug if, among other things, other evidence demonstrates that the drug product is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use.
The EU also has accelerated approval programs. In the EU, a marketing authorization may be granted on the basis of less complete data than are normally required in certain “exceptional circumstances,” such as when the product’s indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive data. Alternatively, a conditional marketing authorization may be granted prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for a full MAA if a product fulfills an unmet medical need and the benefit to public health of the product’s immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the incomplete data.
Orphan Drug Designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition is not likely to be recovered from U.S. sales for that product. The granting of orphan designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such 
25

designation, the sponsor of the product qualifies for various development incentives specified in the ODA, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. Furthermore, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years except in limited circumstances. The EU has a similar Orphan Drug program to that of the U.S., and it is administered through the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP.
Pediatric Testing and Exclusivity. In the United States, NDAs and BLAs are subject to both mandatory pediatric testing requirements and voluntary pediatric testing incentives in the form of exclusivity. An additional six months of exclusivity in the U.S. may be granted to a sponsor of an NDA or BLA if the sponsor conducts certain pediatric studies. This process is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies to determine if the drug or biologic could have meaningful pediatric health benefits. If the FDA determines that the sponsor has conducted the requested pediatric studies in accordance with the written request, then an additional six months of exclusivity may attach in the case of a drug to any other regulatory exclusivity or patent protection applicable to the drug, and in the case of a biologic to any other regulatory exclusivity applicable to the biologic. The EU has a similar requirement and incentive for the conduct of pediatric studies according to the pediatric investigation plan, which must be adopted by the EMA before an MAA may be submitted.
Labeling, Marketing, and Promotion. The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties.
In addition, in the U.S. the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by prison sentences, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information or impose other special requirements for the sale and marketing of drug products. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, federal and state “transparency laws” require manufacturers to track and report certain payments made to healthcare providers and, under some state laws, other information concerning our products. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Compounding Pharmacies and Registered Outsourcing Facilities. Title I (the Compounding Quality Act) of the Drug Quality Security Act, or DQSA, which was enacted in November 2013, amends the FDCA to establish a distinct category of drug compounders known as “outsourcing facilities.” A compounding pharmacy that elects to register with the FDA as an outsourcing facility is exempt from certain FDCA requirements, including the obligation to obtain FDA approval of an NDA, if the facility satisfies conditions set out in the statute. The DQSA also imposes restrictions on the materials that may be compounded at registered outsourcing facilities. Like “traditional” pharmacy compounders, such as those found in hospitals, outsourcing facilities may not compound drugs that are “essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs” or that present “demonstrable difficulties for compounding.” The statute also imposes conditions on the compounding of bulk substances. The FDA has identified compounding as an enforcement priority in 2017, but it remains to be seen how the agency will interpret key provisions of the DQSA, such as the prohibition on compounding drugs that are “essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs,” and to what extent the DQSA gives the agency sufficient authority to regulate compounding activities in violation of the FDCA.
Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Title II (the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA), of the DQSA imposes on manufacturers of certain pharmaceutical products new obligations related to product tracking and tracing, among others, which began a several-year phase-in process in 2015. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers subject to the DSCSA will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Covered manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under the DSCSA, covered manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
26

Foreign Regulatory Requirements. Outside of the U.S., our ability to conduct clinical trials or market our products will also depend on receiving the requisite authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The foreign regulatory approval processes include similar requirements and many of the risks associated with the FDA and/or the EMA approval process described above, although the precise requirements may vary from country to country. In the EU, once an MAA is granted, the product must be “on the market” within three years of the date of authorization. “On the market” is defined as when the medicinal product is “released into the distribution chain,” i.e., out the of the direct control of the marketing-authorization holder, or MAH. Distribution is required in at least one of the EEA member countries within those three years. With respect to OMIDRIA, this requires releasing the product into the distribution chain in at least one EEA country by July 28, 2018. In addition, a marketing authorization will cease to be valid if a product previously placed on the market is no longer actually present on the market for three consecutive years.
Hatch-Waxman Act. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or an approved method of use of the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug that has the same active ingredients and, in some cases (e.g., ophthalmology), also the same inactive ingredients, in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug or receives a waiver from bioequivalence testing. ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit results of pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way based on a showing of sameness and bioequivalence to the listed drug are considered therapeutically equivalent, and are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug. These drugs then generally can be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the referenced approved drug in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new drug. A certification that the new drug will not infringe the already approved drug’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced drug have expired, except for any listed patents that only apply to uses of the drug not being sought by the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has made a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must also send notice of a Paragraph IV Notice Letter to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV Notice Letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of notice of a Paragraph IV Notice Letter automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, modification by a court or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug has expired. The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the “Hatch-Waxman Act,” provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials, other than bioavailability studies, conducted by or for the sponsor, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application based on that listed drug.
As described above, Par has sent a Paragraph IV Notice Letter stating that it has filed an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV Certification under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking approval from the FDA to market a generic version of OMIDRIA prior to the expiration of the Orange Book Patents. Following receipt of Par’s Notice Letter regarding the Paragraph IV Certification, in September 2015, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Par. For more information regarding the ANDA filed by Par and our patent infringement lawsuit against Par, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”

Healthcare compliance laws. In the U.S., commercialization of OMIDRIA and our product candidates, if approved, is subject to regulation and enforcement under a number of federal and state healthcare compliance laws administered and enforced by agencies other than the FDA. These include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits offering or paying anything of value to a person or entity to induce the use of a good or service covered by a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid;


• | the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment by a federal health care program, and which has been interpreted to include claims caused by improper drug-manufacturer product promotion or the payment of kickbacks;


• | a variety of governmental pricing, price reporting, and rebate requirements, including those under Medicaid and the Veterans Health Care Act; and


• | the so-called Sunshine Act and related provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which require that we report to the federal government information on financial payments that we make to physicians and certain healthcare institutions and also on drug samples that we distribute.

In addition to these federal law requirements, there are related state law requirements. Also, if we receive protected patient health information, we may be subject to federal or state privacy laws.
Similar requirements apply to our ex-U.S. operations. U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibit the offering or payment of bribes or inducements to foreign public officials, including potentially physicians or other medical professionals who are employees of public health care entities. In addition, many countries have their own laws similar to the healthcare compliance laws that exist in the U.S.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
Overview. In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products and product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party or private payers including, in the U.S., managed care organizations and private health insurers as well as governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend on a number of factors, including the payer’s determination that use of a product is 

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;


• | appropriate for the specific patient;


• | cost-effective; and


• | neither experimental nor investigational.

Reimbursement by government payers may depend on the same or similar factors as reimbursement by private third-party payers and also depends on complex regulations that may change with annual or more frequent rulemaking and other legislative activities.
Third-party private and governmental payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products or product candidates. Even with the availability of such studies, third-party private and/or governmental payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our products or product candidates, in whole or in part.
United States. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the U.S. to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business. For example, in March 2010 President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Other changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the period 
28

for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, President Trump and various members of Congress have expressed a desire repeal of all or portions of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost-containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial operations.
In October 2014 we were granted transitional pass-through reimbursement status by CMS for OMIDRIA, which became effective January 1, 2015. Pass-through status allows for separate payment for OMIDRIA under Medicare Part B as opposed to having OMIDRIA be included as part of the existing packaged payment for cataract surgery when performed in hospital outpatient departments and ASCs. We expect pass-through status to remain in effect until January 1, 2018. When the pass-through status was granted, CMS set the Medicare reimbursement rate for OMIDRIA under Medicare Part B at the product’s wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, of $465 plus six percent (6%) per single-use vial for the second and third quarters of 2015 after which the rate is based on ASP plus six percent (6%). We are working through legislative and/or administrative means to continue to obtain separate or similar reimbursement for OMIDRIA on and after January 1, 2018; however, if, following the termination of pass-through status for OMIDRIA on December 31, 2017, the drug is packaged into the surgical facility payment, we may need to adjust our pricing accordingly and our revenue could be lower than if separate payment had continued. In addition, reimbursement from private payers may, or may not, reference our CMS reimbursement status in their coverage and payment decisions. Other payers often follow, but are not required to follow, the reimbursement methodology adopted by CMS.
Europe. Governments in the various member states of the EU influence or control the price of medicinal products in their countries through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials or pharmacoeconomic studies that assess the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate relative to currently available therapies or relative to a specified standard. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
Research and Development 
We have built a research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical and medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced research and development management team. We use rigorous project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic research and development programmatic decisions and to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. We also access relevant market information and key opinion leaders in creating target product profiles and, when appropriate, as we advance our programs to commercialization. We engage third parties on a limited basis to conduct portions of our preclinical research; however, we are not substantially dependent on any third parties for our preclinical research nor do any of these third parties conduct a major portion of our preclinical research. In addition, we engage multiple clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials; however, we are not substantially dependent upon any one of these sites for our clinical trials nor do any of them conduct a major portion of our clinical trials. Research and development expenses were $50.7 million, $48.4 million and $47.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Employees 
As of February 28, 2017, we had 154 full-time employees, 73 of whom are in research and development, 53 of whom are in sales and marketing and 28 of whom are in finance, legal, business development and administration. Our full-time employees include three with M.D.s and 22 with Ph.D.s., of whom two and 22, respectively, are in research and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
