ITEM 1. Business
Our Company
 
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to intercepting and preventing immune-mediated diseases. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to business planning, research and development, commercialization activities, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets, partnering and raising capital. We do not have any positive cash flows from operations, and we will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations.
 
On November 17, 2022, the FDA approved TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes (“T1D”) in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. In December 2022 we began shipping TZIELD to our distributors in the United States, which include a specialty distributor and two specialty pharmacies. The full commercial launch of TZIELD began in mid-January 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $405.6 million. Since our inception in October 2016, we have financed our operations primarily through equity and debt financings. Through equity offerings, we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $468.8 million as of December 31, 2022, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. This includes completed underwritten public offerings in June 2020, which raised net proceeds of $103.3 million and in January 2021, which when combined with the partial exercise by the underwriters to purchase additional shares in February 2021, raised net proceeds of $102.3 million, as well as a private placement of common stock and warrants in July 2022 which raised net proceeds of $57.2 million. As of December 31, 2022, we have also raised $57.3 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock under our at-the-market (“ATM”) stock sale programs. In addition, we have received $23.7 million in net proceeds from a Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the “Hercules LSA”), which provides for up to $125.0 million of term loans in the aggregate.

We expect that over the next several years we will continue to incur losses from operations as we increase our expenditures in research and development in connection with our regulatory submissions, clinical trials and other development activities, as well as costs to support the commercialization of TZIELD. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to terminate or delay certain development activities and certain commercial efforts.
 
Merger Agreement with Sanofi
 
On March 12, 2023, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Sanofi and its indirect wholly owned acquisition subsidiary. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Sanofi’s acquisition subsidiary will commence a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at a price of $25.00 per share, to the seller in cash, without interest, but subject to any applicable withholding of taxes. If certain conditions are satisfied and the tender offer closes, Sanofi would acquire any remaining shares of our common stock by a merger of Sanofi’s acquisition subsidiary with and into the Company.
 
The Merger Agreement contemplates that the merger will be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which permits completion of the merger without a shareholder vote promptly following consummation of the tender offer. The obligation of Sanofi and its acquisition subsidiary to consummate the tender offer is subject to the condition that there be validly tendered, and not properly withdrawn, prior to the expiration of the tender offer, that number of shares of our common stock that, together with the number of shares of our common stock, if any, then owned beneficially by Sanofi and its acquisition subsidiary (together with their wholly-owned subsidiaries), represents at least a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the consummation of the tender offer. The obligation of Sanofi’s acquisition subsidiary to consummate the tender offer is also subject to the expiration of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions. Consummation of the tender offer is not subject to a financing condition.
 
Following the consummation of the tender offer and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Sanofi’s acquisition subsidiary will merge with and into the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law as provided in the Merger Agreement, with the Company being the surviving corporation. At the effective time of the merger, each share of our common stock (other than shares of common stock (i) held in our treasury or owned by us or any of our direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, (ii) owned by Sanofi, us or any of Sanofi’s or our respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (other than Sanofi’s acquisition subsidiary), (iii) irrevocably accepted for purchase in the tender offer, and (iv) held by stockholders who have properly demanded appraisal of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the same $25.00 per share price payable in the tender offer, less applicable withholding of taxes.
 
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to carry on our business in the ordinary course until the effective time of the merger. We have also agreed not to solicit or initiate discussions with third parties regarding other proposals for a strategic transaction involving the Company. Sanofi and its acquisition subsidiary have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take actions that may be required in order to obtain antitrust approval of the proposed transaction, subject to certain limitations. The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for each of us and Sanofi, subject, in certain circumstances, to the payment by us of a termination fee of $100.0 million and the payment by Sanofi of a reverse termination fee of $158.0 million.
 
Strategy
 
Our mission is to intercept and/or prevent autoimmune disease and, when possible, durably reset the immune system ahead of disease progression, irreversible tissue damage, and organ failure. Our strategic priorities include:

● | To advance commercialization efforts for TZIELD in our approved indication and continue to pursue clinical development of TZIELD in additional indications; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To preferentially source, develop, and advance clinical-stage, or late preclinical-stage, therapeutic candidates targeting upstream mechanistic nodes in order to intercept and/or prevent immune-mediated diseases 
● | To leverage our immunology research and development capabilities to access different mechanistic approaches through in-licensed assets and/or partnerships 
● | To “predict” and “preempt” pathogenesis by identifying at-risk individuals and early-onset disease patients for whom early intervention may help prevent, ameliorate or delay the progression of chronic life-threatening and debilitating disease 

 
We believe our interception and prevention conceptual platform, experience and expertise in translational medicine and immunology, and our ability to design and execute rapid go/no-go clinical trials makes us unique in the field of autoimmune-mediated disease.
 
We continue building on our access to relevant in-licensing opportunities from industry-leading pharmaceutical companies; innovative, development-stage biotechnology companies; and world-renowned academic centers. To date, we have obtained exclusive worldwide rights to two product candidates from MacroGenics, Inc. (“MacroGenics”), the asset acquisition of TZIELD, and the in-license of PRV-3279, a Phase 2 candidate for the potential treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”). We also in-licensed an enterovirus vaccine platform, targeting the prevention of coxsackievirus B (“CVB”) infections and the potential onset of T1D and celiac disease that includes PRV-101 from Vactech Ltd. (“Vactech”), a Finnish biotechnology company. Additionally, we in-licensed ordesekimab (also known as AMG 714, and formerly HuMax-IL1), a Phase 2 clinical-stage candidate targeting celiac disease, from Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”).

Our Focus and Pipeline
 
Our goal is to pioneer substantial improvements in standards of care for autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disorders are a leading cause of death and disability around the world. Over 24 million patients in the United States live with autoimmune disease, with prevalence increasing significantly. There are over 100 types of autoimmune disorders which reduce patient quality-of-life, can result in complications such as cardiovascular risk and organ failures, and increase the risk of overall mortality.
 
Our portfolio aims to address autoimmune disease through modulating key upstream and nodal mechanisms of immune dysregulation. Our lead asset, TZIELD, is approved to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. We are also developing TZIELD for use in Stage 3 newly diagnosed T1D patients, for which we have an ongoing phase three clinical trial, the PROTECT study. Further, we intend to pursue the development of our other pipeline product candidates in SLE, celiac disease, and other debilitating and life-threatening autoimmune diseases.
 
While the etiology of autoimmune diseases is often complex, poorly characterized or unknown, infections are believed to play a key role in triggering disease. Inflammation is a natural consequence of most infections, as it is the immune system’s first response to invading pathogens in the event of injury or acute illness. Most of the time, this response is beneficial and well-controlled; helping to repair tissue damage and clear pathogens from the body. But when patients have the requisite genetic predisposition for autoimmunity, infections can also trigger chronic autoimmune responses that persist and progress long after the original insult has subsided. Our product portfolio targets upstream autoimmune pathways and viral triggers with the goal of intercepting and preventing life-threatening and debilitating immune-mediated diseases:
 


● | TZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv): a CD3-directed antibody indicated to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adults and pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with Stage 2 T1D. We obtained FDA approval for TZIELD in November 2022. We are also developing TZIELD for use in Stage 3 newly diagnosed T1D patients; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | PRV-3279: a humanized bispecific scaffold molecule targeting the B-cell surface proteins, an inhibitory Fc receptor (“FcR”), known as FcgammaRIIb (“CD32B”), CD32B and CD79B, for the treatment of SLE and for the prevention of immunogenicity of biotherapeutics such as those used in gene therapy; 
● | ordesekimab: a human anti-interleukin 15 (“IL-15”) monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) for the treatment of gluten-free diet non-responsive celiac disease (“NRCD”), intercepting the effects of contaminating gluten in the most common autoimmune disorder without any approved medication; and 
● | PRV-101: a CVB vaccine to prevent acute CVB infections and, in those patients at-risk, to prevent the CVB-triggered autoimmune damage to pancreatic beta cells that may progress to T1D and damage to intestinal cells that may lead to celiac disease.

Recent Company Developments
 
TZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv)
 
FDA Approval
 
On November 17, 2022, the FDA approved TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. With this approval, TZIELD became the first disease-modifying therapy in T1D, a life-threatening autoimmune disease. In December 2022 we began shipping TZIELD to our distributors in the United States, which include a specialty distributor and two specialty pharmacies. The full commercial launch of TZIELD began in mid-January 2023.
 
PRV-3279
 
PREVAIL Phase 2a Study
 
On January 20, 2022, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2a PREVAIL-2 study (PRV-3279 EVAluation In Lupus - Phase 2). PRV-3279 is an investigational humanized bispecific DART molecule targeting the B-cell surface proteins CD32B and CD79B, which has the potential to intercept the pathophysiology of SLE and other B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, as well as to prevent the immunogenicity of biotherapeutic products such as gene therapy.
 
The PREVAIL-2 study is a Phase 2a proof-of-concept (“POC”) study in moderate-to-severe SLE patients induced into response with a short course of corticosteroids, and then monitored for relapse, after randomization to either PRV-3279 or placebo treatment. This design enables the withdrawal of most concomitant medications and clear POC evaluation. The study will be conducted in the United States and Hong Kong. Screening has commenced in the United States with the goal of identifying and enrolling approximately 100 patients to 6 monthly infusions of PRV-3279 or placebo, with primary efficacy readout at 24 weeks. PRV-3279 was well-tolerated in a prior single ascending dose Phase 1 study and a multiple ascending dose Phase 1b study, PREVAIL-1, establishing proof of mechanism with long-lasting inhibition of B cell function as shown by reduction in Immunoglobulin M (“IgM”) production 8 weeks post last dose of PRV-3279. These results, together with observations that CD32B genetic variants are associated with SLE, and that PRV-3279 inhibits B cells isolated from SLE patients, support evaluation in SLE.
 
The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the PREVAIL-2 study enrollment, primarily due to resource constraints at the clinical site level, subdued patient interest in participating in clinical trials of immune modulatory agents. In addition, there has been an increase in competition for enrollment in lupus trials. We now expect top-line results of the PREVAIL-2 study in the second half of 2024.
 
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
 
We are closely monitoring continued developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and are making every effort to ensure we remain focused on the health and well-being of our patients and our employees while maintaining business continuity. At this time, we are unable to predict what the long-term impact of the pandemic, and the associated economic downturn, will have on our business, including planned clinical trial readouts, regulatory interactions and submissions, manufacturing and supply chain, and success of our United States launch of TZIELD. We have experienced some level of disruption to each of our current trials. We completed target enrollment in the PROTECT study in August 2021 and expect to report top-line results in the second half of 2023, subject to change for any potential interruptions related to COVID-19, regulatory decisions or issues or other interruptions. We initiated the ordesekimab Phase 2b trial in gluten free diet NRCD in August 2020 and the pandemic has caused difficulties and delays in recruitment. As a result of these delays, we now expect to report top-line results from the PROACTIVE study by the end of 2023. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the PREVAIL-2 study enrollment, primarily due to resource constraints at the clinical site level and subdued patient interest in participating in clinical trials of immune modulatory agents. We now expect top-line results of the PREVAIL-2 study in the second half of 2024.

Our Products and Product Candidates
 
TZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv) for T1D
 
Our lead asset, TZIELD, is a humanized mAb that binds with high specificity to a cell surface protein called CD3. The CD3 protein is a co-receptor that helps activate T cells and direct different kinds of immune responses. Preclinical data suggests that binding of TZIELD to CD3 triggers events that differentially inhibit the activation of self-reactive T cells without affecting regulatory T-cells (“Tregs”). This restores the important state of immune tolerance and may prevent self-reactive T cells from attacking beta cells in the pancreas. The FDA approved TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. We are also developing TZIELD for use in Stage 3 newly diagnosed T1D patients.
Regulatory History and Key Developments
 
At-Risk Indication
 
FDA Approval and Commercial Launch
 
On November 17, 2022, the FDA approved TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. With this approval, TZIELD became the first disease-modifying therapy in T1D, a life-threatening autoimmune disease.
 
Approval for TZIELD was based on results of the TN-10 Study, a pivotal randomized, double-blind, event driven, placebo controlled clinical trial which evaluated TZIELD for the delay of T1D (Stage 3, or clinical T1D) in Stage 2 T1D patients, defined by the presence of two or more T1D-related autoantibodies and dysglycemia. Seventy-six patients (TZIELD N=44, placebo N=32) were enrolled ages 8 to 49, with 72% under the age of 18, and randomized to receive a single 14-day course of either TZIELD or placebo by IV infusion. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the time from randomization to development of Stage 3 T1D diagnosis. In Study TN-10, Stage 3 T1D was diagnosed in 20 (45%) of the TZIELD-treated patients and in 23 (72%) of the placebo-treated patients. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the time to Stage 3 T1D diagnosis, stratified by age and oral glucose tolerance test status at randomization. The median time from randomization to Stage 3 T1D diagnosis was 50 months in the TZIELD group and 25 months in the placebo group, for a difference of 25 months. With a median follow-up time of 51 months, therapy with TZIELD resulted in a statistically significant delay in the development of Stage 3 T1D, hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.78; p=0.0066). The most common adverse reactions (>10%) that occurred during treatment and through 28 days after the last study drug administration from the TN-10 study were lymphopenia (73% TZIELD, 6% Placebo), rash (TZIELD 36%, Placebo 0%), leukopenia (TZIELD 21%, Placebo 0%) and headache (TZIELD 11%, Placebo 6%).
 
In December 2022 we began shipping TZIELD to our distributors in the United States, which include a specialty distributor and two specialty pharmacies. The full commercial launch of TZIELD began in mid-January 2023. We have entered into a co-promotion agreement for the launch of TZIELD in the United States (the “Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement”) with Genzyme Corporation, a fully-owned subsidiary of Sanofi. Pursuant to the agreement, Sanofi will commit commercial resources, including diabetes field sales, key account directors, field-based reimbursement, thought leader liaisons and medical science liaisons to expand the number of key healthcare professionals reached in the United States. See the section entitled “Significant Contracts and Agreements Related to Research and Development Activities – Co-Promotion Agreement” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also have established a patient support program to help patients that are prescribed TZIELD navigate coverage, reimbursement and access.
 
Post marketing requirements and commitments were communicated to us in the FDA approval letter for TZIELD. The post-marketing requirements include the following (i) conduct a 12-month single arm, open-label study to assess safety and PK in pediatric patients (zero to eight years of age) with Stage 2 TID, followed by a 12-month open-label extension, (ii) conduct an observational registry study over a period of at least 10 years to assess long-term safety in Stage 2 T1D patients, including enrollment of at least 150 subjects exposed to TZIELD and (iii) complete the PROTECT and PROTECT Extension trials to provide comparative safety data on the clinical product used versus the clinical product utilized in the TN-10 trial, and to collect an additional 42 months of long-term safety data. The post-marketing commitments were all related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) and include optimization and validation of analytical methods and standards used to test TZIELD and additional analytical characterization of TZIELD.
 
European and UK Regulatory Interactions to Date
 
In October 2019, the EMA granted PRIME eligibility to teplizumab for the prevention or delay of clinical T1D in individuals at-risk of developing the disease. The PRIME initiative is designed to expedite the development and review of promising therapies that target an unmet need and show potential clinical benefit so the medicine can reach patients earlier. The designation offers the opportunity for enhanced interaction and dialogue with the EMA to optimize development, as well as the potential for accelerated assessment at the time of application for a marketing authorization.

In April 2021, we received initial non-binding scientific advice in a letter from the MHRA on a potential regulatory and market access path forward for teplizumab in the United Kingdom. The MHRA indicated its view that (i) there is an unmet medical need for a treatment that delays or prevents progression to T1D in at-risk patients, (ii) a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) may benefit from additional supplementary information on patient preference, and (iii) reliance on one pivotal study to obtain a marketing authorization ought to meet the criteria described in the EMA/CPMP points to consider on application with (a) meta-analyses and (b) one pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99).
 
An Innovation Passport in the United Kingdom was granted on July 12, 2021 in recognition of the significant patient or public need of teplizumab. Grant of the Innovation Passport paves the way for enhanced engagement with the MHRA and health technology agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) in the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (“ILAP”). ILAP is a new pathway created in the United Kingdom to accelerate the time to market, thus facilitating patient access to innovative medicines. We are targeting a potential filing of a MAA in the first half of 2024, assuming favorable regulatory interactions. We plan to continue to evaluate the regulatory path forward in the United Kingdom and the European Union based on our further engagement with the MHRA, EMA and other European stakeholders in 2023.
 
PROTECT Study for Newly Diagnosed Indication
 
We commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial (the PROTECT study) in approximately 300 pediatric and adolescent patients with newly diagnosed T1D. The first patient was dosed in the second quarter of 2019 and we reached the target enrollment of 300 patients during the third quarter of 2021. Given the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has presented to clinical trials across the industry, we ultimately exceeded the enrollment target by approximately ten percent to ensure there were a sufficient number of evaluable patients. We expect to report top line data from the PROTECT Phase 3 study in the second half of 2023 and determine whether the results support filing a supplemental BLA submission in late 2023 in a newly diagnosed indication for the treatment to preserve beta cell function in individuals with newly diagnosed T1D.
 
Market Opportunity for TZIELD
 
Patients with T1D use daily insulin injections to manage blood sugar to within a normal range. However, it is estimated that fewer than one-third of people with T1D in the United States achieve target blood glucose levels and insulin injections often cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). While insulin injections or infusion allow a person with T1D to stay alive, they do not cure the disease, nor do they necessarily reduce the risk of serious effects and long-term complications of T1D.
 
While pancreatic and islet cell transplantation offer the ability to normalize glucose levels and remove the dependence on insulin products, there are significant risks, resulting in a modest number of such transplants being conducted every year. There is risk associated with mandatory immunosuppression, which commonly results in the development of infections that may be life-threatening. Furthermore, pancreas transplantation may be associated with technical complications (vascular thrombosis, pancreatitis, infection, fistulas) as well as acute and chronic organ rejection. Islet cell transplantation can provide better glycemic control and protect patients from hypoglycemic episodes, but only approximately 50% of patients are insulin-free after three years of follow-up. In a small, published study, Bellin 2012, the addition of teplizumab to the conditioning regimen has improved those figures to approximately 70% insulin-free at 5 years, providing a rationale for the continued study of teplizumab in this context.
 
TZIELD is the only disease-modifying therapy approved in T1D.
 
Estimated Prevalence of T1D
 
According to the International Diabetes Federation, 8.8% of the adult population worldwide has diabetes, among whom 10-15% have T1D. According to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (“JDRF”), it is estimated that over 1.8 million people in the United States have T1D and approximately five million are expected to have T1D by 2050, including nearly 600,000 under 15 years of age. The annual economic burden of T1D has been estimated by JDRF to be greater than $30.0 billion in the United States and greater than $90.0 billion globally.
 
Moreover, the incidence of T1D is increasing worldwide. In the period between 2005 and 2020, epidemiologists predict a 70% increase in the incidence of T1D in children in Europe, with the age of onset decreasing and the number of cases in children younger than five years old doubling.
 
Estimated Patient Prevalence of At-Risk Indications (all ages)
 
Based on our analysis of literature, we believe the following represent the approximate estimated prevalence of At-Risk individuals. Familial direct relatives have 10x greater incidence of T1D autoimmunity than the general population:
 

Market | Stage 1 / Stage 2 >2 Autoantibodies | Stage 2 >2 Autoantibodies and Dysglycemia | Stage 2 Familial Direct Relatives of T1D Patients who exhibit >2 Autoantibodies and Dysglycemia 
-------------------+---------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
United States | 300,000 | 200,000 | 30,000 
European Union | 180,000-300,000 | 120,000-200,000 | 18,000-30,000 

 
Our commercial launch of TZIELD will initially focus on familial direct relatives of T1D patients with two or more autoantibodies and dysglycemia, and then expand to the general populations identified as Stage 2 T1D through potentially increased universal pediatric screening in the United States.

Since we began building our commercial infrastructure in 2020, we have enhanced our commercial capabilities and launch readiness in anticipation of FDA approval of TZIELD. To date, we have conducted primary market research and co-creation sessions with more than multiple stakeholder audiences, including pediatric endocrinologists, adult endocrinologists, certified diabetes educators, T1D patients, caregivers, at-risk individuals, T1D relatives, payers, advocacy groups, among others. These insights have been critical in the development of our go-to-market strategy.
 
Our commercial priorities going forward are as follows:
 
Near-Term Focus
 

● | Commercialization in the United States for the at-risk indication 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | T1D disease and risk factor education 
● | Health care professional (“HCP”) and key opinion leader (“KOL”) engagement 
● | Patient advocacy group engagement 
● | Increasing awareness of screening of familial direct relatives of known T1D patients 

 
Mid-Term Focus
 

● | Inform and support execution of our regulatory strategy and engagement with the MHRA in the United Kingdom and EMA in the European Union on potential approval pathways for TZIELD 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Commercial planning / partnership in European Union 
● | Planning for potential BLA supplement submission for newly diagnosed indication 
● | Increasing awareness of screening of non-familial relatives with risk factors for T1D 

 
Long-Term Focus
 

● | Market expansion with broader general population screening 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Market expansion with label expansion (e.g., re-dosing, <8-year-old patients), combinations and non-T1D indication(s)
● | Potential research efforts to support the addition of age groups and multiple courses of treatment. 

Estimated Patient Incidence of Newly Diagnosed Indications (all ages)
 
It is estimated that approximately 64,000 new cases of clinical T1D in the United States are diagnosed each year, approximately 26% of which are in patients aged eight through 17 years (i.e., the target population of our PROTECT study in Stage 3/newly diagnosed T1D; the Protégé study included subjects aged eight through 35 years).
 
Overall, more than 90,000 children are diagnosed each year in the United States and the largest five European countries combined.
 
T1D Background Information
 
T1D is the end result of immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas and is one of the most common and serious chronic conditions occurring in childhood. T1D patients require life-long dependence on insulin products delivered through multiple daily injections or continuous infusion pumps. While the disease presents in children and adults, the vast majority of T1D is diagnosed in children, with more than half of T1D patients diagnosed before the age of 14 years. The life-expectancy of individuals with younger-onset disease is on average 16 years shorter than non-diabetic individuals. Individuals diagnosed before the age of 10 years have a 30-times greater risk of serious cardiovascular outcomes than the general population resulting in decreased life expectancy, compared to healthy individuals. It is believed the loss of beta cells, which is more severe and rapid in younger individuals leading to increased glycemic load, is the cause of increased cardiovascular-related deaths. The disease is believed to occur in genetically susceptible individuals upon exposure to environmental triggers. In addition, because of a similar genetic predisposition, patients with T1D are at high risk of developing celiac disease. Celiac disease is characterized by autoimmunity in the gut and other organs triggered by consumption of gluten and can lead to malnutrition and other complications including a form of cancer called lymphoma. There is no approved therapy for celiac disease.

Lack of insulin secretory capacity has serious consequences, even when patients receive insulin replacement therapy. The complications of T1D include eye disease, nerve damage, kidney disease and heart disease. Diabetic retinopathy has a prevalence of approximately 80% among patients with T1D and is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among adults. Moreover, about 60% to 70% of people with diabetes present some form of neuropathy that can induce numbness, weakness and blood pressure dysregulation. In addition, diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and affects about 30% of T1D patients. Diabetes can also cause severe heart complications and adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from heart disease than adults without diabetes.
 
In summary, people with T1D experience substantial morbidity and mortality owing to chronic complications.
 
Overview of T1D Biology and mechanism of action of TZIELD
 
T1D is an autoimmune disease which occurs in genetically-predisposed individuals. Specialized white blood cells of our immune system, known as self-reactive T cells (also called auto-reactive), are triggered, presumably by CVB viral infection of the beta cells in at least 50% of cases, to attack and destroy beta cells of the pancreas, thus causing a decline in the natural production of insulin. Simultaneously, another type of T cell, Tregs, which normally suppress the activity of self-reactive T cells, fail to do so effectively.
 
The clinical progression of T1D is relatively well understood and predictable, as it is a continuum marked by clinically-relevant biomarkers which identify stages of the disease. In an individual with genetic risk (primarily driven by human leukocyte antigen (“HLA”) haplotypes), the natural evolution of T1D has been described in stages (see figure below).
 

● | Stage 1: emergence of T1D-related autoantibodies which reflect the initiation of the autoimmune process; this stage is associated with normoglycemia. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Stage 2: persistence T1D-related autoantibodies, but with further loss of beta cell function and development of dysglycemia. 
● | Stage 3: symptomatic or clinical T1D, when remaining beta cell capacity is insufficient to maintain glucose metabolism.

Stages of Type 1 Diabetes
 

It is important to note that once subjects develop two or more T1D-related autoantibodies (Stage 1), the progression to clinical T1D (Stage 3) is not a matter of “if” but “when” as greater than 95 percent of the Stage 1 subjects and virtually all of the Stage 2 subjects will progress to Stage 3 necessitating insulin dependence. The progression of Stage 1 to Stage 3 is 44% in five years, and of Stage 2 to Stage 3 is 75% in four to five years.
 
TZIELD binds to CD3 (a cell surface antigen present on T lymphocytes) to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D. The mechanism may involve partial agonistic signaling and deactivation of pancreatic beta cell autoreactive T lymphocytes. Clinical studies have shown that TZIELD binds to CD3 molecules on the surface of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during treatment, with internalization of the TZIELD/CD3 complex from the surface of T cells. TZIELD also leads to an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells and of exhausted CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, both believed to be important mechanisms of its proposed immunomodulatory properties. TZIELD is not a chronic administration therapy, and a single 14-day course led to a median delay of at least two years in the onset of Stage 3 T1D.
 
Ongoing Clinical Studies
 
Newly-Diagnosed Patients (Stage 3)
 
Phase 3 Clinical Trial of teplizumab in Pediatric Patients Newly-Diagnosed T1D (PROTECT Study)
 
The PROTECT study (PROvention T1D trial Evaluating C-peptide with Teplizumab) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial in pediatric and adolescent patients (aged eight to 17 years) that are newly-diagnosed with clinical T1D. Patients with minimum beta-cell cell function (C-peptide >0.2 pmol/mL) and within six weeks of T1D diagnosis will receive two courses of teplizumab, six months apart. Each course will consist of 12 days of teplizumab administered intravenously, with a cumulative dose of ~9.0 mg/m2. The primary endpoint is the change in C-peptide at 18 months. Secondary endpoints including insulin use, HbA1C levels, hypoglycemic events and safety will also be evaluated. We commenced enrollment in the second quarter of 2019 and reached the target enrollment of 300 patients during the third quarter of 2021. Given the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has presented to clinical trials across the industry, we ultimately exceeded the enrollment target by approximately ten percent to ensure there were a sufficient number of evaluable patients. We expect to report top line data from the PROTECT Phase 3 study in the second half of 2023.
Prior Clinical Evaluation
 
To date, clinical development of teplizumab has included both academic and biopharmaceutical sponsors. Approximately 1,100 subjects have been enrolled in completed teplizumab clinical trials, with over 800 subjects receiving teplizumab. These studies represent various doses, formulations, and indications and includes earlier smaller investigator-sponsored studies. The majority of patients were enrolled in T1D studies (>1,000), and the rest in renal or renal-pancreatic allograft rejection, pancreatic islet transplant, psoriatic arthritis or plaque psoriasis trials.
 
In T1D patients, ten studies have been conducted, of which nine involved intravenous dosing (two Phase 1, three Phase 2, two Phase 3 and a Phase 3 extension study) and one subcutaneous dosing (Phase 1).

Among the T1D studies of teplizumab:
 

● | In Stage 2, the At-Risk study enrolled Stage 2 individuals who were characterized as having at least two T1D autoantibodies and evidence of hyperglycemia.

● | In Stage 3, five studies (Study 1, Study 2, Study 3, Study 4 “AbATE”, and Study 5 “Delay”) were completed under the direction of Dr. Kevan Herold (currently at Yale University) and collaborators. Studies 2, 3 and 4 were sponsored by the Immune Tolerance Network. Four additional studies were conducted by MacroGenics: three with intravenous administration (“Protégé”, “Protégé Extension”, and “Protégé Encore”) and one with subcutaneous administration (SUBCUE) of teplizumab. Among these studies, “Protégé” and “Protégé Encore” were Phase 3 studies. Protégé was the largest completed study for treatment of T1D, which enrolled 516 patients (aged eight to 35 years and T1D diagnosis within 12 weeks of study entry) and randomized into three teplizumab dosing regimens compared to placebo. Teplizumab showed promising immunological and clinical activities in these studies and was well tolerated. In particular, teplizumab treatment showed promising data on the preservation of C-peptide levels and the reduction of exogenous insulin use. 

Clinical Trials in Stage 2 Patients
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of teplizumab in At-Risk Relatives who develop T1D (At-Risk TN-10 Study)
 
The “At-Risk” TN-10 Study, a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial, conducted at TrialNet sites and sponsored by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (“NIDDK”), part of the National Institute of Health (“NIH”), evaluated teplizumab for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals. At-risk was defined by the presence of two or more T1D-related autoantibodies and dysglycemia (abnormal glucose metabolism). 76 subjects were enrolled, ages eight to 49 years, with 72 percent under the age of 18, and randomized to receive a single 14-day course of either teplizumab (cumulative dose of ~9.0 mg/m2) or placebo. Subjects were followed in a blinded fashion until a minimum 40 subjects developed clinical T1D which triggered the analysis of the primary endpoint. Thereafter, subjects were followed indefinitely in other TrialNet studies. Those who developed clinical T1D after the primary analysis was completed are eligible to enroll in a Provention trial, PRV-031-002, which we initiated in March 2020.
 
Participants over eight years of age with Stage 2 T1D (presence of at least two T1D autoantibodies and dysglycemia, who were non-diabetic relatives of T1D individuals) were randomized 1:1 to receive teplizumab or placebo. Dysglycemia was defined on oral glucose tolerance test (“OGTT”) as: (a) Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 110mg/dL, and <126mgdL, or (b) 2-hour plasma glucose ≥140mg/dL, and <200mg/dL, or (c) 30, 60, or 90-minute value on OGTT ≥200mg/dL.
 
The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to the clinical diagnosis of diabetes, using ADA criteria. Criteria for clinical T1D diagnosis are based on glucose testing, or the presence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation (diabetic ketoacidosis). One of the following criteria must be met on two occasions as soon as possible but no less than one day apart for diabetes to be defined:
 

● | Symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours. 
● | 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). The test should be performed using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 1.75g/kg body weight to a maximum of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. 

 
Teplizumab was administered over a 14-day course: 51 μg/m2, 103 μg/m2, 207 μg/m2, and 413 μg/m2 on study days 0–3, respectively, and 826 μg/m2 on each of study days four through 13. A total of 112 participants were screened and 76 were randomized, 44 to teplizumab and 32 to placebo. The baseline characteristics were balanced for age (median ~13-14 years of age), relationship to the relative with T1D, type of T1D autoantibodies and HbA1c.

At-Risk TN-10 Study - Extended Data Readout in June 2020
 
After the primary readout in the TN-10 study, patients were followed indefinitely in other TrialNet observational studies. On June 15, 2020, we announced that new data from the TN-10 study was presented on that date by TrialNet at the 2020 American Diabetes Association Annual meeting. These follow-up data demonstrated that the single 14-day course of teplizumab had delayed the onset of clinical T1D, as compared to placebo, by a median of approximately three years in at-risk individuals. In other words, the follow-up data from the TN-10 added approximately one year to the two-year median delay that was previously observed and reported in the primary analysis. The median time to clinical diagnosis of T1D after one course of teplizumab was approximately five years (59.6 months) compared to approximately two years (27.1 months) for the placebo group (unchanged from previously published data). Nearly half of those treated with teplizumab are estimated to be free of clinical T1D at five years. The hazard ratio was 0.457 or a 54 percent reduction in risk of developing clinical T1D (p=0.01).
 
On March 3, 2021, we announced the peer reviewed publication of the extended follow-up results from the TN-10 study showing that a single teplizumab 14-day course delayed the onset of insulin dependence in T1D patients by approximately 32.5 months compared to placebo.
 


In addition, teplizumab treatment was associated with a greater on-study C-peptide (p=0.009), a measure of a persons’ own insulin production, compared to placebo. For both groups, C-peptide AUC mean slopes preceding study entry were similar and declining. In the placebo group, this decline continued over the six months after study entry. By contrast, the teplizumab-treated group showed an increased C-peptide AUC over this period (p=0.02 relative to study entry).

Note: Adapted from presentation 277-OR at ADA 2020 (Sims et al, June 15, 2020).
 
Mechanistically, the association between the expansion of partially exhausted CD8 T cells and the delay of clinical T1D conferred by teplizumab, previously described in newly diagnosed T1D patients, was also confirmed in subjects at-risk. C-peptide levels at three, six and 18 months post-teplizumab administration correlated with the levels of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the circulation (p=0.01 vs placebo). Subjects with the highest increase (top quartile) in exhausted CD8 T cells at 3 months post-teplizumab had no progression to clinical T1D in the period of observation of the study (p=0.005 vs placebo). Finally, inflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were lower in the exhausted CD8 T cells in teplizumab vs placebo-treated subjects (p<0.0001).
 
In summary, the follow-up results showed that teplizumab’s effect on delaying the onset of clinical T1D was not only consistent from previous analyses, but was durable and now extended the median delay to approximately three years, without any additional safety signals noted.
 
Clinical Trials in Stage 3 Patients
 
Protégé Study
 
Protégé was a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 83 centers in North America (United States, Canada, Mexico), India, Israel, and Europe (Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine) completed between 2007 and 2011. Patients aged eight to 35 years with recently diagnosed T1D (≤12 weeks) were followed for 12 months (Protégé) and continued to 24 months (Protégé Extension). Three dose regimens of teplizumab were administered to 417 patients as intravenous infusions for six to 14 days; 99 patients received placebo. At 12 months, the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients with insulin use <0.5 U/kg per day and HbA1c <6.5%, ranged from 13.7% to 20.8% patients in the teplizumab groups, depending on dosing regimen, and 20.4% in the placebo group. The difference between teplizumab-treated patients and placebo-treated patients was not significant. The change in HbA1c from baseline also did not show a significant difference between teplizumab and placebo. However, subgroup analyses indicated the following findings:

15
--


● | We believe that the primary endpoint could have been achieved if cut-offs were changed to insulin use of <0.25 U/kg per day and HbA1c <7.0%, not only at 12 months but also at 24 months (figure below). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


● | C-peptide levels significantly improved in the teplizumab group compared with placebo group in all patients, and further analyses indicated that this difference was more pronounced in younger patients (aged eight to 11 years) and patients enrolled in United States sites. These findings are consistent with other clinical trials, showing a stronger effect in T1D patients who are younger (<17 years), more recently diagnosed (<10 weeks), and with higher C-peptide levels at baseline. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protégé Encore Study
 
Protégé Encore was a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in 125 centers in 16 countries completed between 2009 and 2012. Patients aged eight to 35 years with recently diagnosed T1D were to be followed for 24 months. Three dose regimens of teplizumab, given as intravenous infusions for six to 14 days, were compared with placebo. The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with insulin use <0.5 U/kg per day and HbA1c <6.5% at 12 months, was not met. Study enrollment was stopped at 254 patients (400 planned) when the Protégé study showed that the primary endpoint was not met. Efficacy analyses were not conducted in this study.

A summary of the C-peptide data in the completed Phase 2 clinical trials and Phase 3 Protégé study are shown in the table below. All these studies have shown consistent and significant C-peptide benefit. Furthermore, subgroup analysis of the Protégé data indicated that younger patients (aged eight to 17 years) with minimum baseline beta cell function (C-peptide >0.2 pmol/mL) along with even more robust data in T1D patients with diagnosis under six weeks (Study 1), informed the inclusion criteria applied in our Phase 3 study, PROTECT.

** | Delay study based on 12-month time-point. All other studies based on 24-month time-points 

 
SUBCUE Study
 
SUBCUE was a randomized, controlled Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and PD of subcutaneously injected teplizumab conducted between 2010 and 2011. Patients aged 18 to 35 years who were diagnosed with T1D within 12 months were to be given three dosing regimens of teplizumab or placebo. Patients were to be followed for 91 days. However, the study was stopped after one subject was enrolled, upon the Protégé study results.
 
Safety Data
 
Teplizumab safety data in T1D subjects have been analyzed from five clinical studies with similar study characteristics including a randomized controlled design and testing the proposed cumulative dose of 9034 µg/m2 (~9.0 mg/m2) per treatment course. Four of these studies enrolled subjects with newly diagnosed Stage 3 clinical T1D (two Phase 2 studies, AbATE and Delay, and two Phase 3 studies, Protégé and Encore). One of these trials enrolled Stage 2 subjects in the At-risk (TN-10) study. The safety summary provided below pools data from the four Stage 3 clinical studies and a separate summary for the Stage 2, At-risk study (TN-10).
 
In Stage 3 teplizumab and placebo subjects, there were no major differences in the overall adverse events (“AEs”) (99.6% and 99.1%), and serious adverse events (“SAEs”) (12.2% (91 of 729 subjects)), and 8.9% (19 out of 213 subjects), although there were more severe AEs in teplizumab subjects (59% and 25%). In At-risk Stage 2 subjects, there was a higher incidence of AEs, SAEs, and severe AEs in the teplizumab subjects compared with placebo (AEs: 97.7% and 68.8%, SAEs: 15.9% (7 of 44 subjects) and 3.1% (1 of 32 subjects), and severe AEs: 59.1% and 9.4%).
 
The most common AEs were related to decreases in white blood cells (lymphopenia, leukopenia and neutropenia) as well as rash. Lymphopenia was expected based on the mechanism of action of teplizumab and was observed in approximately 80% of Stage 3 and 73% of Stage 2 T1D subjects who received teplizumab compared with approximately 18% of Stage 3 and 6% of Stage 2 subjects who received placebo. Lymphopenia was commonly mild to moderate and resolved within 14 days. In Stage 3 T1D subjects, approximately 36% and 12% of teplizumab- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, reported rash. In Stage 2 TID subjects, approximately 14% and 0% of teplizumab- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, reported rash. In teplizumab-treated patients, the rash was predominantly mild to moderate and usually resolved within one to two weeks. Laboratory abnormalities were also reported as AEs. The main differences in incidence in teplizumab and placebo subjects were related to liver function tests. For example, increased alanine aminotransferase occurred in 27.8% and 12.7% of Stage 3 teplizumab and placebo subjects and 4.5% and 3.1% of Stage 2 teplizumab and placebo subjects. These transaminase elevations were likely due to cytokine effects on the liver, usually resolved within 14 days of dose completion, and did not cause significant or lasting clinical concern. Cytokine release syndrome, which may include symptoms of rash, headache, nausea, vomiting, and chills/fever, occurred in 6% and 1.4% of teplizumab- and placebo-treated Stage 3 subjects and 2.3% and 0% of teplizumab- and placebo-treated Stage 2 subjects. Cytokine release syndrome was predominantly mild to moderate in severity, and in the majority of subjects (~80%), the treatment course was completed.

In both Stage 3 and Stage 2 subjects, a total of 118 subjects (98 teplizumab (12.4%), 20 control (8.2%)) experienced one or more SAEs for a total of 167 SAEs. The majority, 76.7%, (128 out of 167) of SAEs were not considered treatment-related, while 23.4% (39 out of 167) were deemed related.
 

● | In Stage 3 subjects, 110 of 729 total participants (91 teplizumab (12.2%), 19 control (8.8%)) reported at total of 158 SAEs. The most common SAEs were related to diabetes control including diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemic seizures/unconsciousness, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia (consistent with the underlying disorder) and were reported in 4.9% and 2.3% of Stage 3 teplizumab and placebo subjects, respectively. These events did not occur in any Stage 2 subjects. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In Stage 2 subjects, 8 of 76 total participants (7 of 44 teplizumab (15.9%), 1 of 32 controls (3.1%)) reported a total of 9 SAEs during the study. Of the 8 SAEs reported in teplizumab subjects, 4 were infections (pneumonia, cellulitis, wound infection, and gastroenteritis). Two of the 8 SAEs reported in teplizumab subjects were considered by the investigators to be related to study treatment and included serum sickness and pneumonia. 

 
Three deaths were observed in Stage 3 subjects and categorized by the principal investigator (in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation/Good Clinical Practice guidelines) and included in the Investigator Brochure for teplizumab filed with the FDA. The relationship between each death and teplizumab is listed in the Investigator Brochure as follows: one death, “none”; one death “not related”; and one death “unlikely.” The specific causes of deaths were (1) unknown for subject with gastrointestinal symptoms which the relationship was listed as “none” in the Investigator Brochure, (2) anterior myocardial infarction with ventricular tachycardia and cardio-respiratory arrest for which the relationship was listed as “not related” in the Investigator Brochure and (3) diabetic ketoacidosis for which the relationship was listed as “unlikely” in the Investigator Brochure. No deaths were reported in Stage 2 subjects.
 
The most common severe AE occurring in at least 10% of Stage 3 subjects was lymphopenia observed in 43.6% (326 out of 729 subjects) and 5.2% (11 out of 213 subjects) of teplizumab and placebo subjects, respectively. In Stage 2 subjects, lymphopenia was also the most frequently observed severe AE, occurring in 47.5% (21of 44 subjects) teplizumab-treated subjects but none of the placebo subjects. This AE is consistent with the mechanism of action of teplizumab.
 
Overall, in both Stage 3 and Stage 2 subjects, infections were reported in comparable rates between teplizumab and controls (53.0% vs 52.7%) with the most common infections reported involving upper respiratory infections (19.0% vs 17.6%), nasopharyngitis (11.1% vs 9.4%) and pharyngitis (5.1% vs 4.5%). The rate of primary EBV infections does not appear to be increased with teplizumab (1.9% vs 3.6%). While there were more cases of EBV reactivation with teplizumab (3.9% vs 1.2%), they were asymptomatic in the majority of subjects and were associated with transient viremia.
 
The safety profile of teplizumab in the at-risk population (Stage 2 T1D), appeared to be comparable with those of newly diagnosed patients (Stage 3 T1D). No new safety signals were identified. The majority of the adverse events were mild to moderate and were transient and manageable.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trial of teplizumab in combination with AG019 in newly diagnosed T1D patients
 
We believe that combination therapy may enhance the potential therapeutic benefit of teplizumab by increasing efficacy, enhancing the durability of response, or restoring insulin production by beta cells. Combination therapies may include islet or beta-cell transplant, regulatory T cells, beta cell antigens, tolerogenic cytokines and other immune modulators, which could enhance the removal of self-reactive lymphocytes or increase the function of Tregs, or metabolic agents that could further improve or preserve beta cell function or mass.

We are collaborating with Precigen and its subsidiary, Precigen ActoBio, to explore the combination of teplizumab and the orally administered AG019, a Lactococcus lactis (“L. lactis”) strain genetically engineered to secrete human proinsulin and human interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Precigen reported positive interim results from the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, in June 2021 and October 2021, for the combination of AG019 and teplizumab, with a 79% response (C-peptide preservation) in newly diagnosed T1D. In addition to this collaboration, we plan to explore other combination therapies in the future.
 
AG019 is an oral-capsule consisting of engineered L. lactis specifically modified to deliver autoantigen human proinsulin and the tolerance-enhancing cytokine human interleukin-10 to the mucosal lining of the gastro-intestinal tissues. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of AG019 alone as well as AG019 in association with teplizumab. The secondary objectives of this study are: to obtain PD data of AG019 as monotherapy as well as AG019 in combination with teplizumab; and PK data to determine the potential presence of AG019 in systemic circulation (safety - systemic exposure) and the presence of L. lactis bacteria in fecal excretion (local exposure). The study has been completed and was conducted in two phases:
 

● | Phase 1b (27 participants enrolled): open-label part of the study which investigated the safety and tolerability of two different doses of AG019 in two age groups (18 to 40 years of age and 12 to 17 years of age). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2a (18 participants enrolled): randomized, double-blind part of the study which investigated the safety and tolerability of AG019, in association with teplizumab, in two age groups (18 to 40 years of age and 12 to 17 years of age). Patients receive a daily dose of oral AG019 monotherapy for 8 weeks in combination with daily intravenous infusions of teplizumab for 12 days. 

 
The study commenced in October 2018 and enrollment is completed. Precigen presented updates in June and October 2021, on their interim data from the Phase 1b (monotherapy) and Phase 2a (combination) arms of the study:
 

● | AG019 was well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with teplizumab with no serious SAEs reported. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In the AG019 monotherapy arm, 56% of adult patients (5 of 9) showed stabilization or increase of C-peptide levels during the first 6 months post treatment initiation. 
● | In the teplizumab combination arm, 79% of all patients (11 of 14) showed stabilization of C-peptide levels at 6 months post treatment initiation. 
● | Exhaustion of autoreactive T cells, only seen in the teplizumab combination arm, correlated with response. 
● | There was an increase in pre-proinsulin (“PPI”) - specific Type 1 regulatory (“Tr1”) cells in both monotherapy and combination arms. 
● | There was a significant decrease in PPI-specific CD8+ T cells in both monotherapy and combination arms. 

 
T1D Lifecycle Management opportunities and other potential indications
 
We are currently exploring and supporting research and lifecycle management programs for T1D beyond our current pipeline. Within T1D, we are exploring programs which include repeat dosing and age expansion for both at-risk individuals and newly diagnosed patients, as well as subcutaneous formulations and combination therapies potentially with antigens, regulatory T cells, metabolic drugs, immune modulators and islet or beta cell transplants. We are evaluating other potential indications for teplizumab including, gastrointestinal (“GI”) immunology disorders such as Crohn’s disease, celiac disease and autoimmune hepatitis or rheumatology disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. These initiatives may result in or include new clinical studies sponsored by us or investigator-initiated studies, which are clinical studies initiated and sponsored by physicians or research institutions with funding from us.

PRV-3279 for SLE and Other Autoimmune Diseases
 
PRV-3279 is a humanized CD32B x CD79B dual affinity biologic in a new class of bispecific scaffold antibody-like molecules called DARTs. It is designed to simultaneously bind to CD32B and CD79B on B cells. The simultaneous binding of both CD32B and CD79B triggers CD32B-coupled immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif signaling, which leads to the suppression of B cells activated to produce auto-antibodies, while not causing broad B cell depletion.
 
We believe PRV-3279 may intercept the pathophysiology of SLE by preventing the production of auto-antibodies by abnormally active B cells. Additionally, based on our published clinical (hepatitis A vaccination) and pre-clinical (Pompe disease gene therapy model) studies, we believe PRV-3279 may prevent the detrimental immunogenicity of biotherapeutic products, such as gene therapy products, though, we will need to conduct additional clinical studies to confirm and support our belief.

SLE Market and Other Opportunities for PRV-3279
 
The treatment and management of SLE depends on disease severity and disease manifestations. Hydroxychloroquine plays a central role in the long-term treatment of SLE and is the cornerstone of SLE therapy. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”), and immunosuppressive agents (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil) have also been used in the treatment and management of SLE. These treatments are only modestly effective and present safety and/or immune suppression concerns with prolonged use. The B cell-depleting antibody rituximab (Rituxan), while not approved for treatment of SLE, appears to be beneficial in certain subsets of patients.
 
In 2011, the FDA approved belimumab (Benlysta), an antibody that targets B lymphocyte stimulator, for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE in combination with standard therapy, providing additional clinical validation of the therapeutic benefit of B cell-targeted therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the modest therapeutic benefit of belimumab and delayed onset of disease intervention indicate the need for additional therapeutic strategies to inhibit overactive B cells. We believe PRV-3279 can fulfill that requirement and is uniquely differentiated to allow for rapid inhibition of activated B cells (potentially more effective than belimumab), while sparing non-activated B cells from depletion or inactivation (potentially safer than rituximab).
 
In December 2020, January 2021, and July 2021, the FDA approved belimumab, voclosporin and anifrolumab, respectively, for the treatment of lupus nephritis (belimumab, voclosporin and systemic lupus, in the case of anifrolumab). We believe that PRV-3279 can be differentiated form anifrolumab (a Type I interferon receptor inhibitor) as it targets B cells, and are focused on development of PRV-3279 in SLE.
 
Sales of therapies to treat SLE are expected to climb to nearly $3.6 billion by 2029, approximately 9% annual growth from 2022. This growth is driven primarily by treatments that target B cells, such as belimumab, with a new indication in lupus nephritis in 2020, off-label use of rituximab, and the approval of new mechanisms (voclosporin for lupus nephritis, approved in January 2021, and the type I interferon inhibitor, anifrolumab, approved in July 2021 for systemic lupus). Despite these available medications, substantial unmet need remains, for novel and safe non-depleting B cell therapy with greater efficacy than belimumab.
 
In addition to SLE, PRV-3279 has the potential to treat other B cell- and auto-antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. Such diseases include multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), where B cell therapies rituximab and ocrelizumab have sales in excess of $1 billion. Several niche/orphan indications may also be explored, including T1D (potentially in combination with teplizumab), Sjogren’s syndrome, vasculitis (e.g., polymyalgia rheumatica, giant cell arteritis, Behçets disease), myasthenia gravis, pemphigus, neuromyelitis optica, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Grave’s ophthalmopathy, IgG4-related disease, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 
SLE Background Information
 
SLE is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect nearly every major organ system, causing inflammation, tissue injury, organ damage, and in some patients, organ failure. The prognosis of SLE is highly variable in individual patients, often waxing and waning throughout their lifetime. The natural history of SLE ranges from relatively benign disease to rapidly progressive and even fatal disease. Comorbidities, such as infections, malignancies, hypertension, lipid disorders and diabetes increase the risk of disability and death in patients with SLE. Organ systems commonly affected by SLE include the central nervous system, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, mucous membranes, heart, skin, hematologic system, musculoskeletal system and lungs, with specific organ involvement defining subsets of the disease (e.g., lupus nephritis). According to the Lupus Foundation of America, at least 1.5 million Americans are afflicted by SLE and more than 16,000 new cases of lupus are reported annually. It is estimated that five million people throughout the world suffer from some form of lupus. Lupus affects primarily women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years). However, men, children, and teenagers can also develop lupus.
 
The pathogenesis of SLE is characterized by an abnormal overactivation of B cells and subsequent pathologic production of auto-antibodies (antibodies that attack one’s own cells and tissues). Uncontrolled activation of B cells is normally terminated when the activating stimulus is exhausted and when a negative feedback loop is triggered by the engagement of CD32B. Mutations in the CD32B gene in humans are associated with an increased likelihood of SLE, and reduced expression of CD32B is apparent in B cells from SLE patients. It is thought that activation of this inhibitory pathway could ameliorate the overactive B cell-driven pathology of SLE and other autoimmune diseases. In addition, the excess auto-antibodies produced bind to target antigens and form immune complexes.
 
When the B cell receptor (“BCR”) (which is the “Y” shaped molecule, resembling an antibody in the figure below) is bound and activated by an antigen, it initiates a cascade of biochemical changes necessary for the activation of the CD32B inhibitory pathway, thus triggering the negative feedback loop. CD79B is a subunit of the BCR that plays a key role in this process when it is close to CD32B. Therefore, if a pharmacologic treatment is to activate the CD32B inhibitory pathway, it also has to simultaneously bind to CD79B. PRV-3279 (formerly MGD010), is a humanized CD32B x CD79B DART protein developed originally by MacroGenics as a bi-specific therapy with these properties, and thus a potential treatment for SLE and other similar diseases. It is designed to simultaneously bind to CD32B and CD79B on B cells.

PRV-3279 and related molecules have shown inhibitory effects on BCR-induced B cell proliferation and antibody secretion (including B cells obtained from SLE patients) as well as beneficial effects in mouse models of autoimmunity. PRV-3279 is expected to boost the negative feedback loop on B cells by robustly engaging the available CD32B and CD79B.
 
PRV-3279 has been studied in humans and was shown to be well tolerated. Proof of mechanism and PRV-3279’s inhibitory effect on antibody immune responses were demonstrated in a Phase 1a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, including a cohort demonstrating inhibition of the immunogenicity of the hepatitis A vaccine. Immunogenicity of PRV-3279 was also observed, but had no impact on mechanistic effects, safety or pharmacokinetics, and decreased with increasing doses of PRV-3279, possibly a reflection of its mechanism of action.
 
Our ultimate goal is to determine if PRV-3279 can intercept the pathophysiology of SLE by preventing the production of auto-antibodies by abnormally active B cells.

Overview of CD32B Biology and Relevance in Lupus
 
CD32B is expressed widely on the surface of human B cells. In addition to its expression on B cells, CD32B is also expressed on other immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells. It is a single-chain protein with a portion that sits outside of the cell membrane, which can be bound by chemical signals.
 
CD32B is the only known inhibitory FcR in the immune system. It plays an important role not only for innate and adaptive immune responses, but also in the maintenance of immune tolerance and controlling autoimmunity. Mice deficient in CD32B have increased antibody responses due in part to chronic B cell activation, and as a result, develop autoimmune disease similar to human SLE. In contrast, B cell-specific overexpression of CD32B and cross-linking of CD32B with antibodies ameliorate the incidence and severity of lupus in mouse lupus models. In humans, mutations and decreased expression of the CD32B gene are associated with an increased likelihood of SLE. These results underscore the important role of CD32B in regulating the antibody immune response and suggest that drug-mediated engagement of CD32B could provide therapeutic benefit in autoimmune diseases by dampening the effects of chronically activated B cells and reducing the production of auto-antibodies. In particular, preventing the production of auto-antibodies could intercept the disease course in lupus nephritis, a subtype of lupus driven by accumulation of auto-antibodies and immune complexes (a mass of antibodies and other molecules) in the kidneys.
 
Consistently, a monoclonal antibody anti-CD19 which binds CD32B with high affinity, obexelimab, was shown in 2018 to be efficacious -albeit missing the primary endpoint- in a Phase 2 lupus trial, particularly in patients with B cell biomarker signatures, providing indirect validation for the potential of PRV-3279 in lupus. Obexelimab, has not moved forward in development in SLE to date. In November 2021, Xencor announced the licensing of obexelimab to Zenas BioPharma, which is currently sponsoring a trial in another immune indication (IgG4-Related Disease).
 
Mechanism of Action of PRV-3279
 
PRV-3279 is in a new class of bispecific scaffold antibody-like molecules called DARTs. It is designed to simultaneously bind to CD32B and CD79B on B cells. The simultaneous binding of both CD32B and CD79B triggers CD32B-coupled immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif signaling, which leads to the suppression of B cells activated to produce auto-antibodies, while not causing broad B cell depletion.
 
To prolong its half-life in the body, PRV-3279 contains a human IgG1 Fc region (a specific antibody fragment) that is manipulated to eliminate its effector function. As a molecule designed to inhibit immune responses, PRV-3279 does not activate any part of the immune system either in the body or in laboratory tests. PRV-3279 also does not bind to platelets, a unique feature compared to competing molecules targeting CD32B that are associated with toxicity due to binding to platelets (e.g., XmAb5871, an anti-CD19 mAb which binds to CD32 via the Fc fragment).
 
Clinical Development Program in SLE
 
Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of PRV-3279 in Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Lupus
 
We are conducting a two-part study in SLE, the PREVAIL (PRV-3279 EVAluation In Lupus) study. PREVAIL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of multiple ascending doses of PRV-3279 in 16 healthy adult volunteers (Part 1) and the efficacy of PRV-3279 in patients with lupus (Part 2). Our ultimate goal is to determine if PRV-3279 can intercept the pathophysiology of SLE by preventing the production of auto-antibodies by abnormally active B cells.
 
On March 12, 2020, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 1b portion of the PREVAIL study. PRV-3279 was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events, and as expected, did not deplete B cells and demonstrated profound and sustained binding to circulating B lymphocytes, with reduction of circulating immunoglobulin M levels in a dose-proportional manner. While anti-drug antibody production was observed at both dose levels tested, immunogenicity was found not to affect exposure, safety or pharmacodynamic parameters. Data from PREVAIL-1 was presented at American College of Rheumatology (“ACR”) conference in November 2020.
 
On January 20, 2022, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2a PREVAIL-2 study. The PREVAIL-2 study is a Phase 2a POC study in moderate-to-severe SLE patients induced into response with a short course of corticosteroids, and then monitored for relapse, after randomization to either PRV-3279 or placebo treatment. This design enables the withdrawal of most concomitant medications and clear POC evaluation. The study will be conducted in the United States and Hong Kong. Screening has commenced in the United States with the goal of identifying and enrolling approximately 100 patients to 6 monthly infusions of PRV-3279 or placebo, with primary efficacy readout at 24 weeks. Stratification and pre-defined subset analysis in PREVAIL-2 of a potentially highly responsive SLE population using a B cell gene signature may identify patients most likely to benefit from PRV-3279 therapy in the future.
 
Clinical endpoints for the PREVAIL-2 Study include time to and frequency of disease flares, and change from baseline in disease activity, assessed based on the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), the British Isles Lupus Assessment Organ System Group scores, physician global assessment of disease activity, patient reported outcomes and use of glucocorticoids or other SLE treatments. Additional biomarkers will include urinary/renal markers (e.g., serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein to creatinine ratio) and blood/circulating markers (e.g., auto-antibodies, complement (C3 and C4), B cell function/phenotype and, B cell gene signature/response relationship).
 
Preclinical Studies for the SLE 
 
In support of the clinical evaluation of PRV-3279 in lupus, we and our partner, MacroGenics, studied the effect of PRV-3279 on B cells from lupus patients ex vivo. PRV-3279 reduced the activation of these B cells similarly to its effects on healthy volunteer B cells, regardless of the activity level of the lupus patients. These data were presented at the ACR conference in November 2020.
 
Prior Preclinical Evaluation of PRV-3279
 
The only nonhuman species that PRV-3279 binds to is chimpanzees. An initial non-Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) study with PRV-3279 in chimpanzees demonstrated it to be well tolerated at all doses, with an assigned no observed-adverse-effect level (“NOAEL”), of 10 mg/kg.
 
Due to the lack of target binding, chronic four-week and three-month repeat-dose GLP toxicology studies were performed using a surrogate DART molecule similar to PRV-3279 that was designed to target human CD32B and mouse CD79B in a transgenic mouse line that expresses human CD32B. A NOAEL at the highest dose of 50 mg/kg was assigned in the three-month study. We believe these studies, and our regulatory interactions, support the advancement of PRV-3279 in long-term efficacy studies in humans, such as PREVAIL-2.
 
Prior Clinical Evaluation and Proof of Mechanism for PRV-3279
 
To date, there have been two clinical trials completed with PRV-3279. The first study was conducted at a single site in the United States, from February 2015 to February 2017 and was a first-in-human (“FIH”), double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of PRV-3279 in healthy adult volunteers.

A total of 49 subjects were randomized; 12 received placebo and 37 received PRV-3279 intravenously at escalating doses from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in six cohorts. PRV-3279 was well tolerated over the range of doses, with only mild adverse events that resolved quickly, including headache, somnolence (sleepiness), upper respiratory tract infection, folliculitis and night sweats. Target binding and proof of mechanism were demonstrated by measuring functional B cell inhibition at doses of 1 mg/kg or higher, without broader B cell activation or depletion observed.
 
Subsequently, proof of mechanism was further confirmed in a dose escalation extension of the study in which single doses of PRV-3279 at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (16 subjects) were compared with placebo (eight subjects) for the ability to affect B cell responses to a hepatitis A vaccine, which was administered to participants who had no previous hepatitis A immunity, on day two of the study. At both doses, PRV-3279 reduced the proportion of volunteers who generated an immune response against the vaccine, as well as the amount of antibody they produced, in both cases as compared to placebo.
 
PRV-3279 exhibited an approximate half-life of seven days after a single dose. A majority (~86%) of study participants developed antibodies against PRV-3279 (i.e., immunogenicity) after receiving the 3 mg/kg dose, but no detrimental effect was observed on the pharmacokinetics of PRV-3279. The proportion of participants developing antibodies against PRV-3279 decreased with increasing dose (29% in the 10 mg/kg dose) and such antibodies did not occur in the multiple dose chimpanzee study, suggesting that PRV-3279 may limit its own immunogenicity at therapeutic doses, which is consistent with its mechanism of action.
 
The second study was the Phase 1b portion of the PREVAIL study, which was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in 16 health volunteers described above.
 
Preclinical Development Program in Gene Therapy
 
Preclinical Studies for the Prevention of the Immunogenicity of Biotherapeutics Including Gene Therapy 
 
We believe that PRV-3279 has the potential to prevent or reduce the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, including but not limited to gene therapy vectors and transgenes (new proteins expressed as a result of the gene therapy).
 
As the field of gene therapy advances, patients’ immune responses to the viral vectors and the transgene products remain a key challenge negatively impacting the safety, efficacy and ability to deliver additional courses systemically. One of the current mitigation strategies to overcome these immune responses is pharmacological modulation of the patients’ antibody immune responses with the B cell depleting agent rituximab in combination with the immune-suppressive agent sirolimus. The use of rituximab has been associated with certain adverse events. The use of PRV-3279, as a non-depleting B cell inhibitor, is a potential strategy to address this unmet need in serious genetic diseases.
 
PRV-3279 reduced B cell responses to viral antigens using an experimental vaccine challenge in a Phase 1 study. In addition, In January 2021, we announced positive results of pre-clinical proof-of-concept experiments in support of the prevention of immunogenicity indication. A PRV-3279 mouse surrogate was tested in mice transgenic for human CD32B, which received gene therapy with an adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector AAV9 encoding for the enzyme acid-alpha-glucosidase (“GAA”) gene. Errors in the GAA gene cause the serious human glycogen storage disease type II known as Pompe disease. In the study, the PRV-3279 surrogate reduced anti-AAV9 vector antibody levels in a dose-dependent fashion. Anti-AAV9 antibodies have been linked to reduced efficacy, safety concerns and the inability to re-dose patients based on these and other study data, we believe PRV-3279 co-administration with gene therapy products has the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic modality. The PRV-3279 surrogate in combination with sirolimus increased skeletal muscle levels of GAA enzyme expression. Consistent with prior results from clinical trials in healthy human subjects, the PRV-3279 surrogate decreased IgM production and was well tolerated.
 
Based on these data, we plan to look for opportunities to work with academic and industry experts to combine PRV-3279 with gene therapy and other biotherapeutic products to further our mission of preventing and intercepting devastating immune-mediated conditions.
 
Ordesekimab, human anti-interleukin 15 mAb for Non-Responsive Celiac Disease (NCRD)
 
Ordesekimab is a fully human immunoglobulin (“IgG1”) mAb that binds to and inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (“IL-15”), which has been identified as a major mediator in the pathophysiology of celiac disease. Ordesekimab has emerged as a leading candidate for the treatment of nonresponsive celiac disease, in which patients continue to have disease activity despite ongoing gluten free diet (“GFD”).
 
Ordesekimab has undergone clinical testing in approximately 250 subjects who have received ordesekimab across two Phase 1 (healthy volunteers and psoriasis), and three Phase 2 clinical trials (celiac disease, RCD-II, RA). No serious adverse events deemed related to ordesekimab were observed that would preclude further clinical development. Proof of mechanism and/or proof of concept was demonstrated in RA, celiac disease and refractory celiac disease Type II. The effect of ordesekimab in celiac disease was evidenced by reduction in inflammation and symptoms after a controlled gluten challenge in a Phase 2a clinical trials with 63 celiac patients.

Celiac Disease Background Information
 
Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease triggered by gluten consumption in genetically susceptible individuals. Approximately 1% of the western population is affected by celiac disease. This prevalence has been reported to be doubling every 20 years. Gluten is ubiquitous in food and elicits autoimmune responses in celiac patients, with damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine. Celiac disease causes debilitating symptoms and serious medical complications, as the small bowel damage can lead to nutrient malabsorption and results in a range of subsequent intestinal and extra-intestinal clinical manifestations. The stimulation of intestinal lymphocytes for decades can lead to the development of lymphoma, with increased mortality.
 
Gluten is the main protein present in some of the most common cereals (wheat, barley, rye). Modern diets are increasingly enriched with gluten and it is also used as an additive in processed foods, cosmetics and oral medications. Gluten is also present in trace amounts in foods labeled as “gluten-free”, as a tableting excipient, and in products such as toothpaste and lipstick. As little as 50mg/day of gluten triggers the disease. A normal diet contains >10 g/day, 200 times the amount that causes damage and intestinal histological abnormalities. As such, celiac patients face enormous challenges to follow a strict GFD.
 
The pathophysiology of celiac disease is characterized by an abnormal immune response to gluten. Humans lack enzymes to fully digest gluten, which against the right genetic background triggers inflammation and autoimmunity in the intestine and in other organs. An adaptive immune response is triggered when gluten peptides are deamidated in the extracellular space, by the enzyme tissue transglutaminase, normally an intracellular enzyme that is released by damaged cells. This deamidation renders gluten peptides high-avidity binders to HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, which present these peptides to intestinal CD4+ T cells, thereby activating these T cells and initiating the inflammatory cascade. The innate immune system’s intraepithelial lymphocytes (“IELs”), primarily CD8+, are able to directly lyse and destroy intestinal epithelial cells, damaging the mucosal lining of the small intestine, in response to IL-15 release stimulated by gluten peptides. In healthy individuals, the activated T cells are controlled by Tregs, but this does not happen in celiac disease as IL-15 confers the effector CD4+ T cells resistance to suppression by Tregs.
 
Celiac disease causes debilitating symptoms and serious medical complications. In many patients, gastrointestinal symptoms derived from intestinal mucosal damage dominate the patient reported symptoms at diagnosis. The normal villi (absorptive finger-like prolongations) present in the gut of healthy individuals are lost in active celiac disease as a result of mucosal atrophy and crypt enlargement. Small bowel damage often leads to nutrient malabsorption that can result in a range of further clinical manifestations (anemia, osteopenia, failure to thrive in children). In addition, extra-intestinal symptoms and systemic manifestations are often present, such as dermatitis, infertility, or neurological and skeletal disorders. Mortality is increased in subjects with persistent intestinal mucosal damage.
 
The most serious complication of celiac disease is the development of an in situ small bowel T cell lymphoma after many years of exposure, voluntary or inadvertent, to gluten. This malignant complication of celiac disease, which appears to be independent of gluten and unresponsive to a strict GFD, is termed RCD-II when the percentage of aberrant IELs is >20% and Type I refractory celiac disease when the percentage is <20%. In RCD-II, aberrant IELs proliferate in what represents a slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma localized (in situ) in the small bowel, primarily in the epithelial compartment. RCD-II affects approximately 0.5% of celiac patients and can lead to overt and systemic enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma, with very poor prognosis and >80% mortality in five years.
 
Celiac Disease Market
 
Celiac disease is the only common autoimmune disorder with no approved medication. The only current available strategy for the management of celiac disease is a lifelong total avoidance of gluten. While simple in theory, the ubiquity of gluten in foodstuffs, medications, household substances, cosmetics, and gluten-free items makes total avoidance of gluten difficult, if not impossible.

25
--


The main challenge to the successful maintenance of a GFD is that cereal flours are widely used in the food industry and are present in numerous food products either naturally or as additives. Although gluten-free products can be purchased, commercially manufactured gluten-free products may be difficult to find, tend to be less flavorful and are more expensive than regular gluten containing foods. In addition, labeling of food products is deficient in many countries. Even in countries with superior labeling guidelines foods labeled “gluten-free” may nevertheless contain gluten. For example, in northern European countries amounts of up to 100 parts per million are permitted in gluten-free products designated apt for celiac sufferers.
 
For these reasons, celiac sufferers are regularly exposed to gluten contamination in the food and beverages they consume. This exposure to gluten contamination and the associated physiological and psychological consequences results in a self-limitation of social activities and/or a reduction in the variety of foods consumed. Thus, the only currently available management option of a GFD presents both a considerable challenge and substantial burden for patients. A study by Shah and collaborators (2014) found the burden of celiac disease and GFD on patient quality of life to be very high, second only to end-stage renal disease – a condition that requires multiple, weekly dialysis treatments.
 
As a result of the difficulty in maintaining total avoidance of gluten while on a GFD, gluten contamination causes 50% or more of all diagnosed celiac patients on a GFD to continue to experience disease activity. Patients who continue to have symptoms despite attempting to maintain a GFD are deemed to have NRCD. NRCD has been defined as “persistent symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities typical of celiac disease despite 6–12 months of dietary gluten avoidance”. As requested by patient support groups and experts, alternative treatment options that can be administered independently or in combination with a GFD, as well as treatments for refractory celiac disease, are required in order to improve the quality of life for celiac patients.
 
There is no approved drug for celiac disease (“CD”). The annual healthcare utilization by NRCD patients in 2013 was $18,206, for $4,796 in matched controls due to the extra costs of uncontrolled CD investigations and treatment of complications. Given the large prevalence (15 to 20 million patients world-wide, 1% of the population in the Western world and 0.5% in Asia), and the unmet need (50% of patients on GFD continue to suffer from disease activity due to contaminating gluten in the diet), NRCD is considered a substantial opportunity for pharmaceutical development of an effective and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment to the GFD.
 
Overview of IL-15 Biology and ordesekimab Mechanism of Action
 
IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that serves as a potent growth, survival, and activation factor for T cells, particularly IELs, and for natural killer (“NK”), cells. Increased expression of IL-15 has been demonstrated in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including celiac disease, RA, and psoriasis. IL-15 is considered a central regulator of celiac disease immunopathology and a non-redundant driver of lymphomagenesis in RCD-II.
 
Substantial evidence suggests a pathophysiological role for IL-15 in celiac disease:
 
Innate immunity:
 

● | IL-15 is an essential, non-redundant growth and activation factor for the IELs which destroy the intestinal mucosa; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The expression of IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium is necessary for villous atrophy; and 
● | In some patients, IL-15 drives progression towards lymphomagenesis and potentially fatal RCD-II. 

 
Adaptive immunity:
 

● | IL-15 enhances the presentation of deamidated gluten peptides by APCs; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IL-15 renders the activated CD4+ T cells resistant to inhibition by Tregs; and 
● | IL-15 has been proven to be a key factor in the loss of tolerance to food antigens. 

 
By activating the IELs, IL-15 is believed to be the main mediator in the mucosal damage that ensues in response to gluten exposure in celiac disease. The expression of IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium is necessary for villous atrophy in animal models of celiac disease and circumstantial evidence suggests this to be the case in humans, as well. In addition, IL-15 renders effector T cells resistant to inhibition by Tregs, promoting loss of tolerance to food antigens.
 
One of the studied mouse models of celiac disease is an IL-15-transgenic mouse, in which IL-15 overexpression by gut epithelial cells leads to celiac-like disease, including T and B cell-mediated pathology. IEL apoptosis has been observed in this animal model after treatment with anti-IL-15 or anti-IL-15-receptor monoclonal antibodies.

Figure 1. Multiple actions of IL-15 in the pathophysiology of celiac and refractory celiac disease
 

Ordesekimab (also known as AMG 714, and formerly HuMax-IL15), is a fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1κ) mAb which binds to and inhibits the function of IL-15 in all its forms (cis, trans, soluble IL-15 bound to IL-15Rα). Ordesekimab inhibits IL-15-induced T cell proliferation and shows a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-15-induced TNF-α production. Ordesekimab underwent preclinical testing and was subsequently evaluated in a Phase 1 and Phase 2 study in subjects with RA, in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and in patients with psoriasis, and in two Phase 2a studies in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease Type-II.
 
Pre-clinical Evaluation of ordesekimab
 
The nonclinical development of ordesekimab consisted of a series of in vitro studies demonstrating the binding properties of ordesekimab against human IL-15; in vitro and in vivo studies providing proof-of-concept for the benefit of blocking the IL-15 pathway in celiac disease; and a series of GLP studies evaluating the nonclinical safety profile of Hu714MuXHu, the ordesekimab surrogate molecule which is active in macaques.
 
Pharmacology
 
Ordesekimab was found to be efficacious in a mouse model of celiac disease triggered by the transgenic expression of human IL-15 in the gut epithelium. In this model, ordesekimab prevented IEL activation and proliferation, as well as histological abnormalities. In addition, ordesekimab was able to induce apoptosis of human IELs in ex vivo culture of small intestinal explants from active celiac disease and RCD-II patients. In this culture experiment, ordesekimab resulted in a suppression of IL-15-driven anti-apoptotic signaling via JAK3 and STAT5.
Toxicology
 
In vitro studies demonstrated that ordesekimab had high binding affinity for human IL-15, but lower affinity for macaque IL-15. Additionally, ordesekimab neutralized human IL-15 but did not efficiently neutralize macaque IL-15. To enable preclinical and toxicology studies in macaques, a surrogate antibody, Hu714MuXHu, was developed by Amgen by fusing the F(ab) portion of a mouse anti-human IL-15 mAb known to neutralize macaque IL-15, M111, with human IgG1 Fc. Hu714MuXHu was shown to neutralize macaque IL-15 with approximately the same potency as ordesekimab neutralizes human IL-15.

There was a decrease in NK cell counts and NK cell activity following administration of Hu714MuXHu to monkeys, reflecting a PD response to IL-15 blockade in this species, given the known role of IL-15 in NK cell biology in animal models (rodents and non-human primates). Of note, no changes in absolute or relative numbers of NK cells were observed in any of the human studies. This difference between observations in preclinical studies and clinical trials appears related to a differential sensitivity of human versus cynomolgus monkey NK cells to IL-15 deprivation. Human NK cells are not dependent on IL-15 for their survival, possibly due to the redundant role of IL-2 on human NK cells.
 
Pharmacokinetics of ordesekimab
 
The PK of ordesekimab was consistent with a typical human immunoglobulin G1 antibody with no apparent target-mediated disposition within the investigated dosing range. The mean half-life in human studies has been 20 to 22 days, potentially enabling monthly dosing.
 
There was no development of anti-drug antibodies to ordesekimab in healthy volunteers, patients with psoriasis or patients with refractory celiac disease. Only one RA patient in the phase 2b study was positive for anti-drug antibodies. Approximately 14% of patients with celiac disease developed anti-drug antibodies in the Phase 2a clinical trial, with an additional 10% presenting pre-existing anti-drug antibodies, a reflection of the abnormal antibody responses which characterize celiac disease. The anti-drug antibodies were not associated with injection reactions or adverse events, and they were non-neutralizing, with no impact on PK.
 
Proof of Mechanism for ordesekimab and Prior Clinical Evaluation
 
Ordesekimab was initially developed for RA in two small Phase 1 and 2 studies with approximately 200 patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Although ordesekimab missed the primary endpoint in the Phase 2 study at week 14, the results were significant at weeks 12 and 16, establishing proof-of-concept. Approximately 60% of patients with active RA in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies versus approximately 30% of patients in the placebo groups demonstrated a response to treatment as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement score (ACR 20) at 8 and 12 weeks, respectively. Ordesekimab also led to decreases in RA inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Ordesekimab was not effective in psoriasis in a small Phase 1 study, suggesting ordesekimab’s action is selective, unlike that of broad systemic immune suppressants.
 
Upon gluten challenge in a Phase 2 clinical trial in celiac disease (CELIM-NRCD-001), ordesekimab did not prevent gluten-induced architectural mucosal injury, and thus missed the primary endpoint, yet the high dose of ordesekimab, 300 mg, showed statistically significant attenuation of gluten’s effects on the change from baseline in intestinal inflammation, in patient-reported symptom questionnaires (the Celiac Disease Patient Reported Endpoint, CeD PRO, a registrational endpoint in NRCD) and in diarrhea, compared with placebo. The totality of the results from the patients who had gluten challenge indicate that 300 mg ordesekimab (formerly AMG 714) given every two weeks can ameliorate the inflammation and symptoms caused by substantial gluten exposure, the first demonstration of such dual benefit in intestinal inflammation and symptoms for any experimental medication for celiac disease. The results suggest that ordesekimab can be a potential adjunctive treatment for NRCD to the GFD to ameliorate or resolve persistent inflammation seen in the majority of celiac patients already on GFD.

Summary data of the Phase 2a clinical trial as presented at Digestive Disease Week in June 2018 is shown below:
 

The CELIM-NRCD-001 study included 62 randomized celiac patients on a gluten-free diet, of which 49 patients underwent a substantial gluten challenge of 2.5 grams per day for 10 weeks in order to assess the ability of ordesekimab to ameliorate the effects of gluten. Upon gluten challenge, ordesekimab did not prevent gluten-induced architectural mucosal changes, the primary endpoint in the study. However, in secondary efficacy assessments, the ordesekimab 300 mg dose consistently attenuated the effects of gluten in intestinal inflammation (intraepithelial lymphocyte density, p=0.03), and in gastrointestinal symptoms as measured by three independent endpoints: the Celiac Disease Patient Reported Endpoint (CeD-PRO, p=0.02), the Celiac Disease Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (CeD-GSRS, p=0.07) and the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS/diarrhea, p=0.0002). The CeD-PRO is a validated endpoint acceptable for registrational trials. In addition, patients in the ordesekimab 300 mg arm had a significantly improved Physician Global Assessment of disease (PGA, p=0.03). The totality of the results demonstrated proof-of-concept for ordesekimab 300 mg given subcutaneously every two weeks in the amelioration of inflammation and symptoms caused by the consumption of gluten by celiac patients. Importantly, ordesekimab was well tolerated, and only 14% of patients developed anti-drug antibodies, which were non-neutralizing and not correlated with impact of efficacy or safety. The PK profile was consistent with a monoclonal antibody, and potentially enables future monthly dosing.
 
In the Phase 2a clinical trial in RCD-II (CELIM-RCD-002), the primary endpoint (reduction in intestinal IELs) was not achieved, yet ordesekimab showed statistically significant benefit over placebo in reducing T cell receptor clonality (no increase in clonality with ordesekimab) and symptoms (diarrhea). Other endpoints, such as histology, did not reach statistically significant differences between groups, but the results consistently favored ordesekimab numerically. Ordesekimab was generally well tolerated, with no observed immunogenicity. A 5-year follow-up of a subset of patients in the CELIM-RCD-002 trial presented at a scientific conference in 2022 showed long-term benefit of treatment with ordesekimab in RCD-II, with reduction in disease activity and clinical improvement compared to patients who received placebo in the trial.
 
Current Clinical Development Program
 
Phase 2b Clinical Trial of ordesekimab in Celiac Disease (PROACTIVE Study)
 
We and our partner Amgen conducted chronic toxicology studies in 2019 and early 2020. In August 2020, we initiated the PROACTIVE study (PROvention Amgen Celiac ProtecTIVE Study), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with NRCD. Ordesekimab will be administered every two weeks via subcutaneous route for six months. The hypothesis of this study is that ordesekimab will be superior to the GFD at intercepting the effects of contaminating gluten exposure in celiac patients following a GFD, as measured by symptoms and objective signs of intestinal inflammation after 24 weeks of treatment. Approximately 220 subjects are planned to be enrolled. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain aspects of medical care during the pandemic, such as a temporary halting of elective endoscopy procedures, lack of prioritization of chronic life-threatening conditions and reduced exposure to gluten due to reductions of travel and dining out, we are experiencing enrollment delays that have extended the enrollment target. We now expect to report top line results from the Phase 2b PROACTIVE study by the end of 2023.

Safety of ordesekimab
 
Approximately 250 subjects have been exposed to ordesekimab to date in completed studies, including approximately 200 subjects for 12 weeks of biweekly dosing. In all studies to date, ordesekimab was generally well tolerated by healthy volunteers, patients with active RA, and patients with celiac disease or RCD-II. While ordesekimab has the potential, to increase susceptibility to infections as is the case with immune modulators, ordesekimab has not demonstrated this effect in the six clinical trials completed to date. No deaths or clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters were observed, including no NK cell depletion.
 
The only adverse events clearly increased in ordesekimab-treated patients have been injection site reactions, which were more commonly reported in subjects exposed to ordesekimab, in a dose-dependent fashion (up to ~52% on ordesekimab vs ~26% in placebo in the celiac Phase 2a clinical trial), and nasopharyngitis (most cases with suspected allergic origin at a single site in RCD-II). In the population which will be studied in Phase 2b, celiac disease, there were no SAEs in the Phase 2a clinical trial, while there were six SAEs (five on ordesekimab and one on placebo) in the RCD-II, a much sicker patient population with immune suppression at baseline. Of the five SAE on ordesekimab in RCD-II patients, two were infections (both resolved while on ordesekimab). There was one mild balance disorder (considered unlikely to be related to ordesekimab and resolved while on the drug). Another patient had mild cerebellar syndrome which led to discontinuation from the study.
 
PRV-101 for Acute Infection and T1D
 
PRV-101 is a polyvalent inactivated prophylactic CVB vaccine candidate targeting all five key CVB serotypes associated the development of T1D, intended to prevent acute CVB infection and the development of CVB-induced T1D and celiac autoimmunity. Based on epidemiological and pre-clinical study data to date, we believe that, if successful, PRV-101 may prevent up to 50% of T1D cases and up to 20% of celiac cases. Preclinical studies completed to date by Vactech and replicated independently by us demonstrate that CVB triggers diabetes in animal models of T1D and that vaccination against CVB protects mice from acute infection as well as prevents the onset of diabetes triggered by CVB infection. Interim results in normal adult healthy volunteers, which we disclosed in a press release in October 2021, showed that in this study PRV-101 was well tolerated and elicited high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies, in a dose dependent fashion in healthy volunteers, against all CVB serotypes included in the vaccine, thus supporting further development of this vaccine.

CVB Infection Market
 
Enteroviruses are responsible for an estimated ten to 15 million symptomatic infections in the United States annually. CVB contributes to a major part of the healthcare costs of enteroviruses as they cause the most serious complications and are among the most frequently reported enteroviral infections according to the CDC. Acute CVB infection is usually asymptomatic or causes common cold-type symptoms. It often also leads to a febrile illness associated by rash, hand-foot-mouth disease and/or mild GI distress. However, CVB infections also cause more severe manifestations including pericarditis, myocarditis, meningitis and pancreatitis.

● | Myocarditis: CVB is the most common etiologic agents for myocarditis in the Western world, responsible for up to 33% of cases of myocarditis. Myocarditis is an important cause of sudden unexpected death: the prevalence of myocarditis in children and adolescents leading to sudden unexpected death has been reported to be as high as 8% to 42%. In certain individuals, acute myocarditis progresses to chronic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a severe life-threatening condition. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Otitis media: otitis media (middle ear inflammation) may develop in patients with upper respiratory disease caused by enterovirus. Otitis media constitutes 18% of physician visits in the United States (largest single reason in children). The costs of otitis media treatment in the United States were estimated to be approximately $3 billion in 2014. 
● | Meningitis: CVB is a common cause of enteroviral meningitis. Meningitis beyond the neonatal period is characterized by the sudden onset of fever of 38-40°C. Headache and photophobia are almost universally reported in these patients. Reports on the incidence of viral meningitis vary from approximately 50,000 hospitalized cases to over 2 million cases of aseptic meningitis per year. Based on 300,000 annual cases of aseptic meningitis in the United States (of which enteroviruses, and coxsackie viruses in particular, are the most common cause), the economic impact is estimated to be $1.5 billion in direct costs alone. 

 
Overview of CVB Infection of the Pancreas, T1D and PRV-101’s Mechanism of Action
 
Longitudinal studies of more than 200,000 children studied for up to two decades in Finland by our technology licensor, Vactech, and its collaborators (“DIPP Study”), identified CVB infection as a likely environmental trigger in the onset of T1D autoimmunity and T1D-associated CD autoimmunity. Subsequent full-virome analysis of the TEDDY Study (400,000 children international study) confirmed that CVB is the only virus whose persistent infection is associated with the development of T1D and celiac disease autoimmunity (T1D-associated and also independent of T1D).

CVB infection is very common and is responsible for various symptoms and complications ranging from mild respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disturbances and hand-foot-mouth disease to life-threatening cardiomyopathy and meningitis. However, in patients with a certain genetic background, CVB appears responsible for the development of autoimmunity. The T1D association with CVB infection has been observed in independent cohorts in 15 countries, including in North America, Europe and Australasia. These epidemiological observations have been substantiated by biological experimentation. Insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas express specialized receptors associated with the transport, storage and release of insulin. These receptors appear to be used by CVB to preferentially infect these cells and polymorphism in these receptors are associated with development of T1D autoimmunity. Infection by enteroviruses can be detected in the pancreatic beta cells of approximately 60% of T1D patients and in the gut of most patients with T1D-associated CD. Importantly, if mothers have anti-CVB immunity at the time of the pregnancy, a 50% reduction in the onset of T1D autoimmunity (T1D-associated auto-antibodies) has been observed in their offspring, presumably due to protection by maternal antibodies passed on to the fetus. This observation strongly suggests the potential efficacy of CVB vaccination for children and/or mothers, resulting in the development of protective antibodies potentially capable of preventing or delaying the onset of T1D.
 
An analysis of stool samples collected from these individuals identified enterovirus infections prior to the first detection of T1D auto-antibodies. Enterovirus RNA was also detected in stool samples. Examination of antibodies present in DIPP children who developed at least two islet cell auto-antibodies (sign of early T1D) and/or progressed to clinical T1D confirmed that among all enteroviruses, only CVB was significantly associated with initiation of beta cell autoimmunity.

Current Clinical Development Program
 
First in Human Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRV-101 (PROVENT Study)
 
In December 2020, we initiated the PROVENT (PROtocol for coxsackievirus VaccinE in healthy voluNTeers) study, a first-in-human study of PRV-101. PROVENT is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized first-in-human study. The study’s primary endpoint is the safety of two dose levels of PRV-101 in healthy adult volunteers provided three administrations with 4-week intervals. Tolerability and immunogenicity were also evaluated. We completed enrollment in April 2021.
 
On March 28, 2022, we announced results from the final analysis of this first-in-human study. In the final analysis, six months following the last administered dose of the vaccine, PRV-101 met the primary endpoint confirming the tolerability observed in the previously reported interim analysis, with no treatment-emerging serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, or adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation or study withdrawal. The results showed durability of VNT responses. Six months following the final dosing, the percentage of subjects in the high-dose PRV-101 arm who maintained high titers of VNT were 100% for the majority of serotypes included in the vaccine and no less than 90% for all serotypes. We are currently exploring partnership opportunities to further the clinical development of PRV-101.
 
Preclinical Evaluation PRV-101
 
Preclinical Data for PRV-101
 
The mechanism of action and efficacy of PRV-101 is supported by the results of several in vivo studies. Inactivated CVB-based viral vaccines efficiently protect mice from CVB infections and from viral spread to the pancreas, as seen for CVB1 and CVB3 vaccines. Similar experiments conducted with a vaccine covering all six CVB serotypes demonstrated that it can induce a strong neutralizing anti-CVB response in mice and protect the animals against multiple CVB infections from the corresponding live viruses. Independent experiments confirm that CVB infection can accelerate T1D onset in T1D susceptible NOD (Non-obese diabetic) or SOCS-1-Tg (suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 transgenic) mice, suggesting that protection from CVB infection would therefore protect against T1D development. This hypothesis has been confirmed in experiments conducted by the Karolinska Institute (Sweden) and the University of Tampere (Finland), demonstrating that CVB1 and CVB3 vaccines produced by Provention indeed protected SOCS-1-Tg mice against T1D induced by CVB1 and CVB3, respectively. These mice develop T1D after CVB infection as a consequence of a direct infection of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and the subsequent immune response against the beta cells, mimicking human T1D. A three-injection vaccination course induced robust neutralizing antibody responses against CVB1/CVB3 and protected mice from both CVB1/CVB3 infection and CVB1/CVB3-driven T1D. CVB1/CVB3 infection led to a loss of insulin-producing cells in unvaccinated mice, which also was prevented by the vaccine. These data strongly supported the development of PRV-101 for the prevention of T1D in humans.

Formalin-Inactivated CVB1 Vaccine is effective against CVB1-Induced T1D in a Mouse Model.
 
As seen in the left panel below, CVB1 infection led to loss of insulin-producing cells, and this pathology was completely prevented by the CVB1 vaccine (right panel). In this experiment, while 50% of unvaccinated mice develop T1D as a consequence of CVB1 infection, all vaccinated mice were protected (not shown).
 

Important from a safety point of view, the formalin-inactivated CVB1 vaccines did not cause any undesirable effects in the pancreas. There was no vaccine-induced pancreatic pathological change, islet autoimmunity or diabetes in the vaccinated mice. Similar results were obtained for Provention-manufactured CVB1 and CVB3 vaccines (not shown).
 
Finally, maternal CVB infection during gestation in mice protects the offspring from CVB infection and subsequent T1D development, presumably through transfer of specific antibodies from the mother to the fetus, corroborating previous findings in humans in the DIPP study and further supporting the use of a prophylactic vaccine to protect against CVB-associated-T1D.
 
CTA-Enabling Program to Support FIH Study
 
The CVB vaccine toxicology program to date has consisted of GLP and non-GLP safety and immunogenicity studies conducted in mice. These studies were designed to identify and characterize potential toxicities associated with PRV-101 treatment, including those arising from the immune responses induced by the product. They mirrored the administration regimen that is now used in the PROVENT FIH study, and by the same route of administration.
 
Pharmacology studies have also been conducted to determine the desired composition of the vaccine, leading to successful GMP manufacturing of the final polyvalent vaccine for clinical trials.
 
Significant Contracts and Agreements Related to Business Operations
 
Co-Promotion Agreement
 
On October 4, 2022, we entered into the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement. Pursuant to the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement, we appointed Sanofi to co-promote and conduct certain commercialization activities with respect to TZIELD in the United States on a co-exclusive basis for the treatment to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. We also committed to reimburse the field force-related expenses and certain other allowable expenses that Sanofi will incur in connection with commercializing TZIELD under the agreement, up to an aggregate cap of $33.0 million, which includes a pre-determined margin on field force-related expenses. Pursuant to the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement, we also granted Sanofi an exclusive, one-time right of first negotiation to obtain exclusive rights to research, develop and commercialize TZIELD with respect to the treatment or delay of T1D, or any of its root causes throughout the world, and to manufacture TZIELD in support of such research, development and commercialization (the “ROFN”) in exchange for a one-time, upfront, non-refundable payment of $20.0 million, and subject to certain retained rights by us to engage in discussions with third parties with respect to certain transactions (“Third Party Transactions”).

The activities of the Company and Sanofi under the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement in the United States will be overseen by a joint steering committee composed of representatives from Provention and Sanofi. Under the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement, subject to any execution of a definitive agreement following an exercise of the ROFN, we will retain the right to develop, manufacture, supply and distribute, as well as determine the commercialization strategy for, TZIELD and will remain responsible for the costs of holding and maintaining regulatory approval of, reporting adverse events relating to, developing, manufacturing, supplying and distributing TZIELD. The term of the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement expires on December 31, 2023. Subject to specified notice periods and limitations, (a) Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement early if regulatory approval for TZIELD either is not obtained in the United States by December 31, 2022 or is obtained but later withdrawn or we undergoes a change of control with a major biopharmaceutical company with a certain level of financial resources and (b) either we or Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Co-Promotion Agreement early if (i) the other party commits an uncured material breach, (ii) the other party undergoes a bankruptcy event, (iii) there is a material safety event associated with teplizumab, or (iv) there is a prolonged delay in performance due to a force majeure event.
 
Simultaneously, we and Sanofi also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Sanofi Securities Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sanofi Securities Purchase Agreement, if the BLA submitted to the FDA for the delay of clinical T1D in at-risk individuals is approved by the FDA, Sanofi has agreed to purchase $35.0 million of our common stock at a purchase price per share equal 140% of the daily volume-weighted average per share price of the Company’s common stock for the five consecutive trading days prior to the closing date. On February 9, 2023, we elected to proceed with the closing of the Sanofi Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, on February 10, 2023, Sanofi purchased 2,712,497 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of approximately $12.90 per share, which was equal to 140% of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company’s common stock for the five consecutive trading days prior to the closing date, for a total investment of $35.0 million.
 
License and Acquisition Agreements
 
MacroGenics Asset Purchase Agreement
 
In May 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “MacroGenics Asset Purchase Agreement”) with MacroGenics pursuant to which we acquired MacroGenics’ interest in teplizumab. As partial consideration for the MacroGenics Asset Purchase Agreement, we granted MacroGenics a warrant to purchase 2,162,389 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. In July 2019, these warrants were exercised by MacroGenics on a cashless basis. We are obligated to pay MacroGenics contingent milestone payments totaling $170.0 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory approval milestones, including $60.0 million which became payable on November 17, 2022 when the FDA approved TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D. This milestone is for the first indication approved in the United States. In addition, we are obligated to make contingent milestone payments to MacroGenics totaling $225.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. We have also agreed to pay MacroGenics a single-digit royalty on net sales of the product. We have also agreed to pay third-party obligations, including low single-digit royalties, a portion of which is creditable against royalties payable to MacroGenics, aggregate milestone payments of up to approximately $0.7 million and other consideration, for certain third-party intellectual property under agreements we assumed pursuant to the MacroGenics Asset Purchase Agreement. Further, we are required to pay MacroGenics a low double-digit percentage of certain consideration to the extent it is received in connection with a future grant of rights to teplizumab by us to a third party. We are obligated to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for teplizumab.
 
On November 30, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the MacroGenics Asset Purchase Agreement (the “MacroGenics Amendment”) with MacroGenics. Pursuant to the MacroGenics Amendment, the $60.0 million milestone payment related to the achievement of FDA approval of TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adult and pediatric patients aged eight years and older with Stage 2 T1D was revised to require the amount to be paid in four equal installments rather than within 90 days of FDA approval. Under the MacroGenics Amendment, we paid $15.0 million on each of November 30, 2022 and March 1, 2023, and are required to pay MacroGenics $15.0 million on each of June 1, 2023 and September 1, 2023.

MacroGenics License Agreement
 
In May 2018, we entered into a License Agreement with MacroGenics (the “MacroGenics License Agreement”), pursuant to which MacroGenics granted us exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing MGD010 (renamed PRV-3279), a humanized protein and a potential treatment for SLE and other similar diseases. As partial consideration for the MacroGenics License Agreement, we granted MacroGenics a warrant to purchase 270,299 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share. In July 2019, these warrants were exercised by MacroGenics on a cashless basis. We are obligated to make contingent milestone payments to MacroGenics totaling $42.5 million upon the achievement of certain developmental and approval milestones for the first indication, of which we paid $0.4 million to MacroGenics in April 2022. This payment was triggered upon the enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2a PREVAIL-2 study. We are also obligated to make contingent milestone payments totaling $22.5 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals for a second indication. In addition, we are obligated to make contingent milestone payments to MacroGenics totaling $225.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. We have also agreed to pay MacroGenics a single-digit royalty on net sales of the product. Further, we are required to pay MacroGenics a low double-digit percentage of certain consideration to the extent received in connection with a future grant of rights to PRV-3279 by us to a third party. In connection with our grant of certain rights for PRV-3279 to Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Huadong”) under the Huadong License Agreement (as defined below), in May 2021, we paid $1.1 million to MacroGenics related to “qualified” consideration, as defined in the MacroGenics License Agreement, that we received from Huadong. See below for further description of the Huadong License Agreement.
 
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval for PRV-3279. The license agreement may be terminated by either party upon a material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, by us without cause upon prior notice to MacroGenics, and by MacroGenics in the event that we challenge the validity of any licensed patent under the agreement.
 
Huadong License Agreement
 
In February 2021, we entered into a License Agreement with Huadong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Huadong Medicine Co., Ltd. (the “Huadong License Agreement”), pursuant to which we granted Huadong exclusive rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing PRV-3279, a DART® (bispecific antibody-based molecule) targeting the B cell surface proteins CD32B and CD79B, in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan). We will retain exclusive worldwide rights to develop PRV-3279 for combination uses to reduce the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, but Huadong will have the exclusive right to distribute PRV-3279 in that field in Greater China. In consideration of the license and other rights granted as part of the Huadong License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $6.0 million and will receive up to $11.5 million in research, development and manufacturing funding over the next three years, of which $5.5 million was received as of December 31, 2022. If Huadong successfully develops, obtains regulatory approval for, and commercializes PRV-3279 in Greater China, we are eligible to receive up to $37.0 million in regulatory milestones and up to $135.0 million in commercial milestones based on aggregate net sales in a calendar year in Greater China. If commercialized, we would also be eligible to receive low double-digit royalties on net sales of PRV-3279 by Huadong in Greater China. The License Agreement may be terminated by either party upon a material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, by Huadong without cause upon at least 12 months prior notice to us, and by us in the event Huadong challenges a licensed patent or in the event that our upstream license terminates. We may also terminate the License Agreement if Huadong ceases commercialization of PRV-3279 for a consecutive period of six months after first commercial sale. We are generally responsible for the manufacturing of PRV-3279 through regulatory approval in Greater China, and Huadong will exclusively purchase all clinical and commercial supply requirements of PRV-3279 from us until Huadong exercises its option to assume manufacturing responsibilities, which may be triggered after regulatory approval in China. We will retain all rights to PRV-3279 in the rest of the world. We recently initiated a Phase 2a trial of PRV-3279 in systemic lupus erythematosus in January 2022 and are conducting a portion of this trial in Hong Kong.

Vactech License
 
In April 2017, we entered into a License Agreement with Vactech (the “Vactech License Agreement”), pursuant to which Vactech granted us exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing the CVB vaccine platform technology. In consideration of the licenses and other rights granted by Vactech, we issued two million shares of our common stock to Vactech. We recorded the issuance of the shares at their estimated fair value of approximately $1.70 per share, for a total of $3.4 million as a license fee expense included as part of research & development expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. We paid Vactech a total of approximately $0.5 million for transition and advisory services during the first 18 months of the term of the agreement. Vactech is obligated to transition its intellectual property, provide reference samples, assist with the technology transfer to a third-party contract manufacturer, and participate on our scientific advisory board. In addition, we may be obligated to make a series of contingent milestone payments to Vactech totaling up to an additional $24.5 million upon the achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory filing milestones, of which we paid $0.5 million to Vactech in April 2021. This payment was triggered upon the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 1 PROVENT study, which occurred in January 2021. In addition, we have agreed to pay Vactech tiered single-digit royalties on net sales of any approved product based on the CVB platform technology and three additional payments totaling $19.0 million upon the achievement of certain annual net sales levels. The Vactech License Agreement may be terminated by us on a country by country basis without cause (in which case the exclusive global rights to the technology will transfer back to Vactech) and by either party upon a material breach or insolvency of the other party. If we terminate the agreement with respect to two or more specified European countries, the agreement will be deemed terminated with respect to all of the European Union, and if we terminate the agreement with respect to the United States, the agreement will be deemed terminated with respect to all of North America. The agreement expires upon the expiration of our last obligation to make royalty payments to Vactech.
Amgen License and Collaboration Agreement
 
In November 2018, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen for ordesekimab (also known as AMG 714), a novel anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of gluten-free diet NRCD. Under the terms of the agreement, we will conduct and fund a Phase 2b trial in NRCD and lead the development and regulatory activities for the program. Amgen agreed to make an equity investment of up to $20.0 million in us, which was completed in September 2019 through the purchase of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock. Amgen is also responsible for the manufacturing of ordesekimab. Upon completion of the Phase 2b trial, a $150.0 million milestone payment is due from Amgen to us, plus an additional regulatory milestone payment, and single digit royalties on future sales; provided, however, that Amgen has the right to elect not to pay the $150.0 million milestone, in which case we will have an option to negotiate for the transfer to us of rights to AMG 714 pursuant to a termination license agreement between Amgen and us. The material terms of the termination license agreement have been negotiated and agreed and form part of the Amgen Agreement. Under the terms of the termination license agreement, we would be obligated to make certain contingent milestone payments to Amgen and other third parties totaling up to $70.0 million upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and a low double-digit royalty on net sales of any approved product based on the IL-15 technology. The agreement may be terminated by either party upon a material breach or upon an insolvency event and by Amgen if we are not able to fund our clinical development obligations (among other termination triggers). The agreement expires upon the expiration of Amgen’s last obligation to make royalty payments to us.
AGC Biologics Agreement
 
In February 2019, we entered into services agreement with AGC Biologics (“AGC”), to manufacture and supply TZIELD for our anticipated clinical and commercial supply needs. We may terminate the agreement or any stage of services thereunder with 90 days’ prior written notice. If we provide less than 12 months’ notice of termination for the termination of a scheduled batch, we may incur a cancellation fee. The amount of the cancellation fee would depend on the timing of such notice. Each party also has the right to terminate the agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by AGC with current GMP, cooperation by AGC in connection with marketing applications for TZIELD, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Parexel Services Agreement
 
In February 2019, we entered into a services agreement with Parexel (the “Parexel Services Agreement”), pursuant to which we retained Parexel to perform implementation and management services in connection with the PROTECT study of TZIELD. We may terminate the services agreement or any work order for any reason and without cause with 90 days’ written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach or, bankruptcy petition by the other party or, if any approval from a regulatory authority is revoked, suspended or expires without renewal.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our current patent applications and any future patents and other proprietary rights that we own, or control through licensing, are and will be essential to our business. We believe that these intellectual property rights will affect our ability to compete effectively with others. We also rely and will rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for our/their intellectual property, including those patent applications to which we have secured exclusive rights.
 
We plan to spend considerable resources and focus in the future on obtaining United States and foreign patents. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property. No assurances can be given that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. We intend to expand our international operations in the future and our patent portfolio, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 
TZIELD (teplizumab-mzwv, anti-CD3 antibody)
 
Through our agreement with MacroGenics, we have acquired a patent portfolio that includes seven issued patents, including two United States patents and five ex-United States patents in Australia, Israel, Mexico and Singapore. The issued patents are set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2026 and 2028, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law. These issued patents cover use of certain humanized antibodies that bind to CD3 in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including T1D and RA.
 
In September 2022, US Patent No. 11,434,291 and Japan Patent No. JP7137696 were granted, and these patents should expire in May 2040. Additional patent applications are pending in 14 countries. We have additionally filed four PCT international patent applications, three United States non-provisional patent application, six United States provisional patent applications, and 21 ex-United States patent applications directed to various new uses of anti-CD3 antibodies, including teplizumab for the prevention or delay of clinical T1D, combination therapy as well as new dosing regimens.

The patents and patent applications disclose a platform technology for making diabodies, specific anti-CD32B antibodies, specific anti-CD79B antibodies, specific diabodies that co-ligate both CD32B and CD79B, as well as use of these antibodies and diabodies in treating various disorders, including cancer, autoimmune disorder, inflammatory disorder, and IgE-mediated allergic disorder.
 
The issued patents in the United States and various ex-United States countries generally have terms of 20 years from their respective priority filing dates, subject to available extensions, and are thus set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2032 and 2034, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law. In the event that the pending patent applications issue as patents, although there can be no assurance that the patent applications will issue, the patents would be set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2032 and 2037, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law.
 
We have additionally filed two PCT international patent applications, three United States non-provisional patent application, and 13 ex-United States patent applications directed to new uses of B cell inhibitors such as PRV-3279, including the prevention of immunogenicity associated with gene therapy, and treatment of B cell driven autoimmune and/or allergic diseases, among other things. If issued, patents claiming priority to these applications will expire no earlier than 2040, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments or extensions available under the law.
 
Ordesekimab (anti-IL-15 antibody)
 
Through our agreement with Amgen, we have licensed a patent portfolio that includes: i) 34 issued patents, including eight United States patents, 16 patents in European countries, and 10 patents in other ex-United States jurisdictions; and ii) 19 pending patent applications, including two pending United States patent applications, one pending European patent application, and 16 pending patent applications in other ex-United States jurisdictions.
 
The patents and patent applications disclose anti-IL-15 antibodies, methods of using the same, manufacturing conditions and dosages of the same.
 
The issued patents are set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2024 and 2027, subject to any disclaimers or extensions under the law. In the event that the pending patent applications issue as patents, although there can be no assurance that the patent applications will issue, the patents would be set to expire no earlier than dates ranging from 2026 and 2037, subject to any disclaimers, patent term adjustments of extensions available under the law.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We are a newly commercial stage company, without a history of commercial revenue or marketing experience. Because commercialization is expensive and time consuming, we have appointed Sanofi to co-promote and conduct certain commercialization activities with respect to TZIELD in the United States. See the section entitled “Significant Contracts and Agreements Related to Business Operations – Co-Promotion Agreement” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We also intend to explore multiple commercialization strategies outside the United States, including:
 

● | exploring strategic partners for commercialization in markets outside the United States; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | considering launching in the U.K. ourselves, depending on ongoing discussions with potential partners ex-United States; 
● | strategically entering into co-development partnership(s) to retain potential for commercialization rights on selected drug candidate(s) and market opportunities; and 

 
We expect that partnering with pharmaceutical or biotherapeutic companies may accelerate product acceptance into target market areas outside the United States and gain the sales and marketing advantages of the partner’s distribution infrastructure. We intend to continue to strengthen our market position and solidify our leadership position in immunotherapy by continuing to improve our technology, broadening our clinical and therapeutic applications, identifying new clinical and therapeutic applications and forming strategic relationships with our licensors.

Manufacturing
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of TZIELD or our product candidates. Although we rely and intend to continue to rely upon third–party contract manufacturers to produce our products and product candidates, we have recruited personnel and consultants with experience to manage these third–party contract manufacturers. In certain cases, our collaboration partners for each respective program are responsible for providing clinical drug supply or drug product for those program’s clinical trials. In other cases, we have engaged third-party manufacturers to provide services related to process development, non-GMP and GMP manufacturing and other related services.
 
The table below lists the third-party responsible for manufacturing drug supply for each of our programs:
 

Product Candidate | Supplier | Party Responsible for Costs 
----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------
TZIELD | AGC Biologics | Provention 
PRV-101 | Intravacc | Provention 
PRV-3279 | Current drug supply – MacroGenics Future drug supply – vendors being evaluated | Provention Provention 
Ordesekimab | Amgen | Amgen 

 
In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with AGC Biologics to manufacture teplizumab for our anticipated clinical trial needs as well as for the commercialization of TZIELD.
 
Supplies of TZIELD sufficient to supply our commercial launch and expected demand have been manufactured by our CMOs. In addition, we have sufficient supply to complete the PROTECT study and our other clinical development needs.
 
In order to maintain regulatory approval for TZIELD, third-party manufacturers will be required to consistently produce TZIELD in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis and document their ability to do so.
 
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from well-established large pharmaceutical companies, as well as innovative new entrants. Nevertheless, we believe our strategic intent is sufficiently differentiated in that we are focusing on intercepting or potentially preventing the onset and progression of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases by selecting and developing product candidates that are aimed at relevant and predominantly upstream pathophysiological targets.
 
The symptomatic treatment of T1D is a highly competitive market with large incumbents such as Sanofi, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly providing insulin and Medtronic, Abbott, and Dexcom providing blood glucose monitoring products and many working on new ways to manage the disease. Our goal is to delay or prevent the onset of T1D and spare patients the need to live with blood glucose monitoring and daily insulin injections and the many complications and clinically relevant shortfalls of this therapy. We believe our enteroviral vaccine approach is unique in that it aims to prevent the onset of T1D prior to the rise of immune cells and auto-antibodies programmed to attack insulin producing beta cells. We are aware of competitive vaccine technologies in development that are attempting to alter the autoimmune cycle once these auto-antibodies have been detected. However, we believe our vaccine approach may intercept the process prior to this cycle being initiated (primary prevention). There is at this time no other CVB vaccine in clinical development.
 
We believe, our secondary prevention (i.e., interception) approach with TZIELD is more advanced and differentiated from other immunomodulation therapies which have shown preservation of beta cell function in early phase studies of newly diagnosed onset T1D including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), CTLA4-Ig (costimulatory blocker), anti-CD20 (Rituxan) and LFA3-Ig (alefacept). All of these Phase 2 studies were conducted by the academic community or by T1D networks and do not appear to be in active Phase 3 development by industry sponsors. The most recent data were reported with thymoglobulin which is an approved anti-thymocyte globulin obtained by immunization of rabbits with human thymocytes and is indicated for the treatment of renal transplant acute rejection in conjunction with concomitant immunosuppression and for induction in adult renal transplant recipients. Low dose ATG was administered intravenously for 2 days in early onset T1D (within 100 days of diagnosis). While C-peptide preservation was observed, due to the risk of serum sickness, ATG was administered during a 2-3 day hospitalization and required pre-medication, including intravenous corticosteroids. In January 2020, a Phase 3 trial in newly diagnosed T1D patients with ladarixin (Dompe) an interleukin-8 inhibitor, was announced on the basis of post-hoc results in a subset of patients after the drug failed to improve C-peptide in Phase 2a. Importantly, TZIELD is the only drug approved for the prevention/delay of clinical T1D in Stage 2 T1D patients, and no other pivotal studies are on-going in this indication.

Ordesekimab has the potential to be the first drug ever approved for CD since it is one of the few experimental candidates which have shown simultaneous improvement in gluten-induced symptoms and gut inflammation, and since most clinical-stage products are early in development and have not established proof-of-concept. There is another anti-IL-15 mAb in clinical development, CALY002 by Calypso, currently in Phase 1, and a new IL-15/IL-21-targeting peptide, EQ102 by Equilium, initiating Phase 1. Potential additional competition includes the recent initiation of a Phase 1b study with the marketed psoriasis anti-IL-23 mAb guselkumab (TREMFYA, Janssen), and experimental medications in Phase 2b development by: ImmunogenX (IMGX-003/latiglutenase), Takeda/Zedira/Dr. Falk (TAK1227), and Takeda TAK-062. Earlier experimental candidates in development include Takeda’s TAK-101 (in Phase 1b/2a) and Anokion’s KAN-101.
 
The market for lupus is currently led by large pharmaceutical companies commercializing older, off-patent products such as steroids, immunosuppressive agents including azathioprine, cyclosphosphamide, cyclosporine and mycophenolate. In addition, Glaxo SmithKline (“GSK”) and Roche offer B cell-targeted agents. GSK received approval for belimumab (Benlysta) in 2011, the first drug approval in lupus in 50 years. Despite modest efficacy and slow onset of effect, belimumab’s annual sales are currently approximately $1.2 billion and are expected to continue to grow following the December 2020 approval in lupus nephritis. Roche’s rituximab (Rituxan), a blockbuster drug, is used off-label in lupus despite not having been approved in SLE. The calcineurin inhibitor voclosporin (Aurinia Pharmaceuticals) was approved for lupus nephritis in January 2021. Anifrolumab (SAPHNELO, Astra Zeneca) is a type 1 interferon receptor mAb approved in July 2021. The lupus field is competitive and new experimental drugs are being tested in late-stage trials by large pharmaceutical companies and early to mid-stage biotech companies. We expect that PRV-3279 will be differentiated from the B cell-focused competition because of greater and faster-onset efficacy, better safety (PRV-3279 does not deplete B cells and is not expected to be immune-suppressive), and less side effects (since PRV-3279 is a highly specific mAb with likely minimal off-target side effects).
 
There are no drugs approved for the prevention of the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, and rituximab is occasionally used off-label in gene therapy. Experimental medications are being tested in Phase 1-2 by Selecta Biosciences and Hansa Biopharma.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business activities, including the manufacturing, research, development and marketing of TZIELD and our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, the European Union, or the United Kingdom, any new drug developed by us or our collaborators must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA, EMA or MHRA, respectively. The process for obtaining regulatory approval and compliance with applicable federal, state, supranational, domestic and local laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Government and private payor coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly impact our ability to successfully commercialize any future approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be impacted by applicable future healthcare and drug pricing initiatives. In addition, in the United States, we are subject to state and federal laws, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and transparency laws that restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. We are also subject to equivalent legislation in the other countries where we perform our business activities.

Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates human drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. In the European Union, the EMA primarily regulates human drugs under Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EU) 726/2004, and associated legislation, as amended from time to time. In the United Kingdom, the MHRA primarily regulates human drugs under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012/1916 and associated legislation. In their respective jurisdictions, the FDA, EMA and MHRA regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, packaging, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, import, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to GLP regulations or other applicable regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices (“GCPs”), and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or BLA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including payment of application user fees; 
● | acceptance of the NDA or BLA for filing and review by the FDA; 
● | review of the NDA or BLA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with GMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the NDA or BLA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, which may be subject to additional post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and any post-approval studies required by the FDA. 

 
Equivalent processes are in place in the European Union and the United Kingdom. The key features of the approval processes in Europe are as follows:
 

● | prior to any clinical trial commencing, a clinical trial authorization (“CTA”) must be obtained from the national competent authority (“NCA”) of each country in which the clinical trial will be conducted and new legislation has recently entered into application in the European Union which, subject to transition periods, will streamline this process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prior to any clinical trial commencing, a favorable opinion of a research ethics committee (“REC”) in each country in which the clinical trial will be conducted must be obtained; 
● | in relation the European Union and United Kingdom respectively, preparation and submission to the EMA through the Centralized procedure which is mandatory for medicinal products developed by means of biotechnological processes and MHRA of an MAA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including payment of application user fees; 
● | in relation the European Union, following a successful review of the MAA, the EMA will issue an opinion on the approvability of the MAA to the European Commission, who will then decide whether to issue the marketing authorization (“MA”) in a binding decision; and in relation to the United Kingdom, following a successful review of the MAA, the MHRA will act on behalf of the Licensing Authority to issue an MA.

Nonclinical and Clinical Development
 
Before testing any drug product candidates in humans, the product candidate intended for human use must undergo rigorous laboratory and animal testing until adequate proof of safety is established. This preclinical testing generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies, to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. In the United States, the conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety and toxicology studies, and equivalent rules apply in the European Union and United Kingdom. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND, and to the NCAs of the European Union member states and the MHRA (as applicable) as part of their respective CTA application procedures. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Equivalent processes apply in the NCAs of the European Union member states and the MHRA.
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, as well as any subsequent amendments, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and to the NCAs of the European Union member states and the MHRA (as applicable) as part of their respective CTA application procedures. Additionally, in the United States, each clinical trial and its related documentation, including the trial protocol and informed consent form, must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. In Europe, the process involves the review of equivalent documents by a REC in each country in which the clinical trial will be conducted. In the United States, some clinical trials are also overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study.
 
Clinical trials for new product candidates are then typically conducted in humans in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into a small number of healthy human volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The emphasis of Phase 1 trials is on testing for safety or adverse events, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the compound for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a compound shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA, EMA or MHRA (as applicable) may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA, BLA or MAA (as applicable). Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 
During the development of a new drug or biological product, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of phase 2, and before submission of an NDA or BLA. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, scientific advice can be sought from regulators to guide product development. Regulatory authorities, IRBs, RECs and Data Monitoring Committees may require additional data before allowing clinical trials to commence, continue or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA, NCAs of the European Union member states and/or MHRA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, GCP, or other IRB requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

In the United States, information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the Clinicaltrials.gov data registry. In the European Union, this information must be posted on the European Union Clinical Trials Register, and in the United Kingdom, it must be posted on a publicly accessible database.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final drug or biological product. For biological products in particular, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined in order to help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Generating the required data and information for regulatory approval takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Following completion of the required testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are submitted to, in relation to the United States, the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, and in relation to the European Union and the United Kingdom, the EMA and MHRA respectively as part of an MAA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product in the proposed patient population to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA and/or MHRA (as applicable). Under the PDUFA, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2022 is $3,117,218 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2022 is $369,413. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis, but fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. In the European Union, the MAA must be accompanied by an application fee, which, as of January 16, 2023, starts at EUR 297,400 for applications concerning a single strength, one pharmaceutical form, and one presentation. In the United Kingdom, the MAA must be accompanied by an application fee, which, as of January 16, 2023, varies from GBP 18,473 for MAAs submitted pursuant to the reliance procedure for approval to be granted based on the assessment already carried out by the EMA, to GBP 92,753 for stand-alone MAAs.
 
In the United States, under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA or BLA submitted for FDA approval is given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the NDA or BLA. If deemed sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA and BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA has established internal goals of eight months from submission for priority review of NDAs or BLAs that cover product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and 12 months from submission for the standard review of NDAs and BLAs. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, these performance goals may change over time and the review is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically conduct pre-approval inspections of the facilities at which the product is manufactured to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit the clinical trial sponsor and one or more sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. Additionally, the FDA may refer any NDA or BLA, including applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.

Before receiving FDA approval to market a potential product, we or our collaborators must demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that the potential product is safe and effective in the patient population that will be treated. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or BLA or supplement thereto must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies.
 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant has one year to either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy, regulations or statutes governing product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review.
 
If regulatory approval of a potential product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is approved. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is generally prohibited. Furthermore, FDA approval may require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling and entail ongoing requirements for risk management, including post-marketing, or Phase 4, studies, testing and surveillance programs, distribution restrictions, and other post-marketing requirements and commitments. Following approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval and may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 
Any drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or during clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates. Further, such unacceptable toxicity or side effects could ultimately prevent a potential product’s approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or limit any labeling claims and market acceptance, even if the product is approved.
 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
In the European Union, the assessment of an MAA for a new medicinal product takes up to 210 ‘active days’, discounting the procedural clock-stop periods during the procedure for the applicant to address the list of questions raised by the EMA’s advisory committees. When an MAA is submitted, the rapporteur and co-rapporteur appointed by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”) lead the assessment on the evidence submitted by the applicant for the CHMP to determine the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product. The CHMP may recommend an inspection to be carried out by a NCA of the European Union member state to verify the state of compliance of the manufacturing facility and the clinical trial conduct. In parallel, a rapporteur and co-rapporteur of the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (the “PRAC”) are appointed to lead the assessment of all aspects of the applicant’s proposed risk management plan (the “RMP”) which describes a set of pharmacovigilance activities and interventions designed to identify, characterize, prevent or minimize risk relating to the medicinal product under review.

By day 210, the CHMP adopts an opinion on the MAA as to whether the medicinal product should be granted a MA. Within 15 days of receipt of the CHMP’s opinion, the applicant can request re-examination of the CHMP’s opinion and detailed grounds should be submitted within 60 days. The re-examination is led by new rapporteurs and must be completed within 60 days from the date of receipt of the detailed grounds for re-examination for the CHMP’s final opinion to be adopted.
 
In relation to the United Kingdom, high quality MAAs can be submitted for an expedited 150-day assessment to be initiated. At least 90 days prior to the intended MAA submission date, applicants should request a pre-submission meeting from the MHRA. At this meeting, the applicant will provide a short summary of the dossier and, if necessary, request input on specific issues, such as consideration for an orphan MA, conditional MA or MA under exceptional circumstances. When the MAA is submitted to the MHRA, the clock will start when the application is validated for completeness of dossier for the regulatory review to commence. The assessment process involves two phases which are separated by a ‘clock-off’. At Day 80 constituting the Phase 1 of the assessment procedure, matters requiring clarification will be raised with the applicant as a letter requesting further information (“RFI”). Applicants must address these matters within 60 days. Phase 2 of the MAA process begins as soon as the MHRA receives the applicant’s responses to the RFIs. By day 150, the MHRA will provide a decision on approvability of the product. If the MHRA proposes to refuse the grant of the MA, the applicant can request a review of the decision.
 
Any trade name that we intend to use for a potential product must be approved by the FDA, EMA and/or MHRA (as applicable) irrespective of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or equivalent foreign authorities. The FDA, EMA and MHRA conduct rigorous reviews of proposed product names, and they may reject a product name if they believe, among other things, that the name inappropriately implies medical claims or if it poses the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA will not approve a trade name until the NDA or BLA for a product is approved. If the FDA determines that the trade names of other products that are approved prior to the approval of our potential products may present a risk of confusion with our proposed trade name, the FDA may elect to not approve our proposed trade name. If our trade name is rejected, we will lose the benefit of any brand equity that may already have been developed for this trade name, as well as the benefit of our existing trademark applications for this trade name.
 
We and our collaborators and contract manufacturers also are required to comply with the applicable GMP regulations. GMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the FDA, EMA, NCAs and MHRA (as applicable). These facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our potential products and must maintain ongoing compliance for commercial product manufacture. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and could be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws, including the equivalent requirements applicable in Europe. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to GMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, BLA or MA, including voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions.
 
If a product is approved, we must also comply with post-marketing requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with advertising and promotion requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”), monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse events and other periodic reports, product sampling and distribution restrictions, and limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA, EMA and/or MHRA approval (as applicable) of a new NDA, BLA or MA, or an NDA, BLA or MA supplement/variation, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.

Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to adverse publicity as well as significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 
The FDA, EMA and MHRA (as applicable) may withdraw approval of an NDA, BLA or MA if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials; refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs or BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
 
Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, marketing authorization will be granted. This foreign regulatory development and approval process involves all of the risks associated with achieving FDA marketing approval in the United States as discussed above. In addition, foreign regulations may include applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities.
 
Expedited development and review programs
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, and accelerated approval pathway.
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The sponsor of a drug or biologic can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval. Fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.
 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications.

--


A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, such as the required post-marketing confirmatory trial does not demonstrate a clinical benefit, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication be submitted to the agency in advance for review.
 
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA or NDA from the date of filing.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 
In the European Union, developers of medicinal products seeking to address an unmet medical can seek obtain enhanced support from the EMA via the PRIME scheme. The PRIME scheme, which is a voluntary operational framework for enhanced interaction and early dialogue between the EMA and developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so that these medicines can reach patients earlier.
 
In the United Kingdom, developers of medicinal products which either target a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition, or which represent a significant patient or public health need, can benefit from ILAP. ILAP consists of designation of an Innovation Passport, creation of a Target Development Profile (“TDP”) and provides applicants with access to a toolkit to support all stages of the design, development and approvals process. Medicines falling within the scope of ILAP include new chemical entities, biological medicines, new indications and repurposed medicines. The first step in the ILAP process is to obtain an Innovation Passport, which will only be granted in respect of medicinal products which: (1) are intended to treat a qualifying condition, patient or public health area, (2) fulfill one or more of a specific area (e.g., advanced therapy medicinal product, orphan products, etc.), and (3) have the potential to offer benefits to patients. Following designation of an Innovation Passport, a product-specific team of experts will develop a TDP based on the medicinal product’s characteristics. The TDP defines key regulatory and developmental features, identifies potential pitfalls, and creates a road map for delivering early patient access. The TDP also includes details about how the applicant can work with other United Kingdom stakeholders for coordinated and efficient evidence generation and evaluation and address commercial and managed access considerations.
 
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for the treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 

47
--


Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for certain tax credits. In addition, if a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years following product approval unless the subsequent product candidate is demonstrated to be clinically superior. Absent a showing of clinical superiority, the FDA cannot approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.
 
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. To qualify for orphan exclusivity, however, the drug must be clinically superior to the previously approved product that is the same drug for the same condition. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 
In the European Union, orphan designations are assessed by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) for binding decisions to be issued by the European Commission to promote the development of medicinal products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, there can be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition already authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
 
If the COMP grants an orphan designation, the developer will be entitled to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. If orphan status is maintained at the grant of MA, the medicinal product will benefit from ten years of market exclusivity. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, MAs can only be granted to “similar medicinal products” for the same therapeutic indication if it can be established that: (i) the new medicinal product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the MA holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication.
 
An equivalent regime is in place in the United Kingdom. Under the United Kingdom’s regime, there is no pre-MA orphan designation and instead a decision is made at the point of the MA grant.
 
Rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program
 
Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application.
 
A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or BLA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA or BLA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA or BLA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by the FDA; and the NDA or BLA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher.
 

48
--


To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA or BLA, of its intent to request a voucher. If the FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA or BLA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA or BLA a voucher upon approval of the NDA or BLA. The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval.
 
The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or BLA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee. The FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA.
 
The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the Creating Hope Reauthorization Act in December 2020, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2020 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to October 1, 2026.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity that cover the product are extended by six months.
 
In both the European Union and United Kingdom, all MAAs for new medicines must include the results of studies described in an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), unless a deferral or a waiver applies. Irrespective of whether the results are successful, if the PIP is satisfactorily performed with the results submitted, the applicant is entitled to receive a six-month extension to their supplementary protection certificate, as an extension of the exclusivity for a basic patent. In respect of orphan medicinal products, the orphan market exclusivity period of 10 years is extended cumulatively to 12 years if the PIP requirement is satisfied.
 
United States Patent Term Restoration and Extension and Marketing Exclusivity
 
In the United States, a patent claiming a new drug product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the submission date of the NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA and the ultimate approval date, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
 
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Biosimilars And Exclusivity
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the ACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”). The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an existing FDA-licensed “reference product.” The FDA has issued multiple guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, including laws governing pharmacy practices, which are state regulated, to regulate the use of biosimilars.
 
Regulation of companion diagnostic tests
 
Although we do not believe that a companion diagnostic test will be required for the safe and effective use of our product candidates, the FDA may disagree and require use of a companion diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population.

Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of TZIELD and potential sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payers.
 
Within the United States, third party payors include government health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and private health insurance. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of new products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for TZIELD or any other approved drug product, we may need to collect real world evidence and conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. If third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow sale of a product at a profit.
 
Third-party payers are also increasingly managing patient access to drug products and using restrictive measures to contain costs. If a third-party payer decides to provide coverage for an approved drug product, patient access and reimbursement is not certain. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover TZIELD or our product candidates, if approved, could reduce utilization of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. We may need to provide discounts to purchasers to encourage purchasing of our products and rebates to third party payors to increase the possibility of favorable coverage and adequate cost sharing thresholds for patients and may need to provide additional concessions or enter into value-based arrangements that link payment to the efficacy of TZIELD. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
We are required to provide discounts or rebates on TZIELD under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal health care programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Sales of TZIELD and potential sales of our product candidates, if approved, will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. In the United States, our business operations and any current or future arrangements with healthcare professionals, third-party payers, health care providers, patients and other customers may be subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our current or future manufacturing, sales, marketing, scientific, educational or other business activities. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

● | The federal anti-kickback statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal anti-kickback statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

● | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or by private individuals in the name of the federal government.

● | The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 


● | The United States federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of entities, which include many healthcare providers and health plans with which we interact.

● | The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for unapproved indications and regulates the distribution of samples.

● | Federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs. 


● | The so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, teaching hospitals, and additional categories of healthcare practitioners to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public.

Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply to claims reimbursed by private payors as well as government programs or regardless of reimbursement. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose specific restrictions on interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or to report pricing or marketing expenditures, as well as state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Many of these laws and regulations also contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.
 
Our current or future activities may also be subject to state and federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must comply with state, domestic and international laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in relation to the United States, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.
 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Because of the breadth of these laws, the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and safe harbors and the lack of clear guidance on the application of these laws to certain activities, it is possible that governmental authorities could possibly conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.

Violation of these laws can subject us to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
 
Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws requiring the implementation of corporate compliance programs and laws requiring the reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities.
 
Segments and Geographic Information

A portion of the compensation for almost all of our employees is performance-based. Performance-based compensation takes into account both individual and Company-wide performance. In addition, a portion of performance-based compensation consists of equity incentives. The split between base salary and performance-based compensation is tailored to each employee’s job function and level. In addition, we provide nationally competitive benefits, including healthcare, a 401(k) program and a technology allowance.
 
We are committed to the well-being of our employees and recognize that a remote workforce especially values the ability to balance work with other aspects of their lives. As a virtual company, we embrace variable work schedules for our employees. We also allow part-time arrangements and flexible work schedules.
 
We provide professional development and advancement opportunities for our employees that include internal training, skills building and opportunities for internal advancement.
