  Item 1. Business
 
  General
 
 We are an international renewable natural gas, renewable fuels and byproducts company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace traditional petroleum-based products. We operate in two reportable geographic segments: “North America” and “India.” For revenue and other information regarding our operating segments, see Note 12 - Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
  We were incorporated in Nevada in 2006.
 
 We own and operate a 65 million gallon per year ethanol production facility located in Keyes, California (the “Keyes Plant”). In addition to low carbon renewable fuel ethanol, the Keyes Plant produces Wet Distillers Grains (“WDG”), Distillers Corn Oil (“DCO”), and Condensed Distillers Solubles (“CDS”), all of which are sold to local dairies, poultry and feedlots as animal feed. The primary feedstock used for the production of ethanol at the Keyes Plant is number two yellow dent corn, which is procured by J.D. Heiskell from various Midwestern grain facilities and shipped via Union Pacific Railroad to an unloading facility adjacent to the Keyes Plant.

 During 2018, Aemetis Biogas, LLC (“ABGL”) was formed to construct bio-methane anaerobic digesters at local dairies near the Keyes Plant (the ABGL Central Dairy Digester Cluster”), many of whom also purchase WDG we produce. The digesters are connected via a pipeline owned by ABGL to a gas cleanup and compression unit being built at the Keyes Plant to produce Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”). During 2020, ABGL completed construction on the first two diary digesters and the pipeline that carries bio-methane from these dairies to the Keyes Plant. The next phase of the project involves the construction of 15 additional dairies, for a total of 17 dairies. With plans to build digesters at more than 30 dairies, ABGL continues to negotiate and sign participation agreements with local dairies and convert those agreements into fully executed leases to capture dairy bio-methane from manure wastewater lagoons where the bio-methane would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Upon receiving the bio-methane from the dairies, impurities will be removed and converted to RNG where it will be either injected into the local gas utility pipeline, supplied to a renewable compressed natural gas (“RCNG”) truck loading station that will service local trucking fleets to displace diesel fuel, or used as renewable energy at the Keyes Plant.  The environmental benefits of the ABGL project are significant because dairy biogas RNG qualifies for a negative carbon intensity (“CI”) pathway under the California LCFS and receives D3 RINs under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”). ABGL completed construction of the first two digesters and private pipeline and began operations in the third quarter of 2020.
 
 In December 2018, we purchased a 5.2-acre parcel of land next to the Keyes Plant and subsequently leased the land to the Messer Group (“Messer”) to build a gas liquification plant. We constructed a piping structure to convey the CO2 produced at the Keyes Plant to the Messer plant (the “CO2 Project”). The Aemetis portion of the CO2 Project construction was completed in January 2020, with Messer completing construction of their plant in April 2020. We commenced operations in late April 2020, and began recognizing revenue from this project in the second quarter of 2020.
  
 We lease a site at the Riverbank Industrial Complex in Riverbank, California, near the Keyes Plant, where we plan to utilize biomass-to-fuel technology that we have licensed from LanzaTech Technology (“LanzaTech”) and InEnTec Technology (“InEnTec”) to build a cellulosic ethanol production facility (the “Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility”) capable of converting local California waste biomass – principally agricultural waste – into ultra-low carbon intensity renewable cellulosic ethanol. By producing ultra-low carbon renewable cellulosic ethanol, we expect to capture higher value D3 cellulosic renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) credits.
 
 The first phase of construction and operations at the Riverbank site is installation of the waste wood handling and the first gasifier unit, as well as gas cleanup, hydrogen production and hydrotreating systems for the production of renewable jet and diesel fuel (the “Jet/Diesel Plant”).
 
 During 2017, Goodland Advanced Fuels, Inc. (“GAFI”) was formed to acquire land, buildings and process equipment in Goodland, Kansas for the construction and development of a next generation biofuel facility for $15.4 million. GAFI entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Third Eye Capital Corporation (“Third Eye Capital”). GAFI, the Company and its subsidiary Aemetis Advanced Product Keyes (“AAPK”) also entered into separate Intercompany Revolving Notes, pursuant to which GAFI may lend a portion of the proceeds of the revolving loan under the Note Purchase Agreement to AAPK. On December 31, 2019, Aemetis exercised an option it was granted in connection with the foregoing to purchase all of the capital stock of GAFI and has future plans to construct an advanced biofuels facility at the Goodland site. Prior to December 31, 2019, GAFI was consolidated into the financial statements as a variable interest entity.
 
 We entered into an agreement to purchase Zebrex dehydration equipment from Mitsubishi on August 24th, 2018, to improve process efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG) at the Keyes Plant. We began initial equipment installation in the first quarter of 2020. The agreement allowed for deferred payments of the equipment until the unit begins operations. Due to COVID-19 shelter in place restrictions, construction of the project was halted late in the first quarter of 2020. Ongoing restrictions and contractor availability further delayed work toward completion until the second quarter of 2021. The Mitsubishi Zebrex ethanol dehydration system is a key part of increasing the electrification of the Keyes Plant and decreasing natural gas usage at the facility. This project decreases the carbon intensity of fuel produced at the Keyes Plant, allowing Aemetis to realize a higher price for the ethanol sold.
 
  In December 2020, Aemetis Inc., announced its subsidiary, Aemetis Properties Riverbank, Inc., acquired less than a 20% ownership in Nevo Motors, Inc. (“Nevo Motors”). Under this agreement, Nevo Motors will utilize certain of Aemetis’ existing and future manufacturing facilities and fueling stations, as well as renewable natural gas and renewable electricity produced by Aemetis.

  In January 2021, a U.S. patent was awarded for our exclusively licensed technology for the production of below zero carbon renewable fuel. This license enabled us to launch the “Carbon Zero” production plants that are designed to convert below zero carbon feedstocks such as waste wood and agricultural waste and renewable energy such as solar, RNG, biogas into energy dense liquid renewable fuels. These renewable fuels can be utilized in hybrid electric cars or other electric engines which may create a below zero carbon greenhouse gas footprint across the entire life cycle of the fuel based on the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model, the leading lifecycle analysis measurement tool.
 
  The “Carbon Zero” biofuels production plants are designed to produce biofuels, including renewable jet fuel, utilizing renewable hydrogen and non-edible vegetable oils sourced from existing Aemetis biofuels plants and other sources. The first Aemetis Carbon Zero production plant (“Carbon Zero 1”) is expected to utilize hydroelectric and other renewable power available onsite to produce 25 million gallons per year of jet fuel, renewable diesel, and other byproducts. The plant is expected to supply the aviation and truck markets with ultra-low carbon renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and other pollutants associated with conventional petroleum-based fuels. The Carbon Zero 1 plant is planned at the Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility. The Carbon Zero 1 plant will extract sugars from waste wood and then process the sugar into renewable fuel at the Keyes Plant. The remaining waste wood will be gasified for the production of renewable hydrogen to be used in producing jet and diesel fuel.
 
 We also own and operate a biodiesel production facility in Kakinada, India (the “Kakinada Plant”) with a nameplate capacity of 150 thousand metric tons per year, or about 50 million gallons per year. We believe the Kakinada Plant is one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in India on a nameplate capacity basis. The Kakinada Plant is capable of processing a variety of vegetable oils and animal fat waste feedstocks into biodiesel that meet international product standards. The Kakinada Plant also distills the crude glycerin byproduct from the biodiesel refining process into refined glycerin, which is sold to the pharmaceutical, personal care, paint, adhesive and other industries.
 
 On March 18, 2020, in order to address a worldwide shortage of hand sanitizer during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the US Treasury Tobacco and Alcohol Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”) provided emergency waivers allowing fuel ethanol plants to produce high-grade alcohol for use in the production of hand sanitizer. Immediately following the emergency waiver for ethanol producers in March, Aemetis began supplying high-grade alcohol for the production of hand sanitizer. During the first week of April 2020, Aemetis applied for and was approved by the TTB as a Distilled Spirits Producer (“DSP”), which allowed the Company to produce fuel ethanol, high-grade alcohol for sanitizer and other health care and sanitary products, as well as industrial alcohol and potable alcohol for beverage spirits.
 
 To further address this market, Aemetis began a series of capital projects at the Keyes Plant that will ultimately enable the Company to produce US Pharmacopeia (“USP”) grade alcohol for sale into these key medical, consumer, governmental and industrial alcohol markets. During June 2020, Aemetis renamed Biofuels Marketing, Inc. as Aemetis Health Products, Inc., and began a sales and marketing strategy of blending, bottling, and selling hand sanitizer into bulk, retail branded, and white label markets. Additionally, Aemetis Health Products, Inc. is developing sales and marketing channels for other personal protective equipment.
 
  Strategy
 
 Key elements of our strategy include:
 
  North America
 
 Leverage technology for the development and production of additional advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals. We continue to evaluate new technology, develop technologies under our existing patents and conduct research and development to produce renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels from renewable feedstocks. Our objective is to continue to commercialize our portfolio of technologies and expand the adoption of these advanced biofuels and bio-chemicals technologies.

 We hold certain rights to technologies for the conversion of orchard, forest, dairy, and construction and demolition waste wood into low carbon renewable fuel. We intend to utilize this technology to produce renewable hydrogen for use in the production of jet fuel, diesel fuel and cellulosic ethanol at the Riverbank Cellulosic Ethanol Facility from agricultural biomass waste abundantly available from orchard waste wood in California’s Central Valley. Our planned first phase has an estimated 23 million gallons per year of nameplate capacity. We intend to expand production facilities to an estimated 46 million gallons per year nameplate capacity at the Riverbank site and build additional plants in California to utilize the estimated 1.6 million tons of annual waste orchard wood in Central California, as well as other waste wood feedstocks.
 
 Diversify and expand revenue and cash flow by continuing to develop and adopt value-added by-product processing systems and optimize other systems in our existing plants. In April 2012, we installed a DCO extraction unit at the Keyes Plant and began extracting corn oil for sale into the livestock feed market. During 2014, we installed a second oil extraction system to further improve corn oil yields from this process. During late 2017, we entered into agreements to sell substantially all of the CO2 produced at the Keyes Plant to Messer, which built a liquid CO2 capture plant adjacent to the Keyes Plant that was operational in the second quarter of 2020. We have plans to install a mechanical vapor recovery (“MVR”) system that allows for the compression of process vapor to steam resulting in a significant reduction of natural gas consumption. Additionally, we are developing the Aemetis Integrated Solar Microgrid Systems (“AIMS”) with battery backup that allows for the displacement of natural gas electricity with carbon-free electricity, which is expected to begin construction at the Keyes Plant in the third quarter of 2021. We continue to evaluate and, as allowed by available financing and free cash flow from operations, adopt additional value-added processes that decrease costs and increase the value of the ethanol, WDG, DCO and CO2 produced at the Keyes Plant.
 
 Leverage our position as a plant operator to develop additional streams of revenues and profitability. In December 2018, we leveraged our relationship with California’s Central Valley dairy farmers by signing leases and raising funds to construct the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Digester Cluster, constructing dairy digesters that collect bio-methane which will be conveyed by pipeline to our Keyes Plant. We have constructed our first two digesters, four miles of pipeline, and commenced operations in the third quarter of 2020. In addition, we have signed agreements with approximately 15 additional dairies to construct additional dairy digesters. Additionally, we continue to evaluate technologies from our existing and planned operations for the development of the property in Goodland, Kansas.
 
 Acquire, license our technologies to, or joint venture with other ethanol and biodiesel plants. There are approximately 200 ethanol plants that are operational in the U.S., as well as biofuels plants in Brazil, Argentina, India and elsewhere in the world that could be upgraded to expand revenues and improve their cash flow using technology commercially deployed or licensed by us. After developing and commercially demonstrating technologies at the Keyes Plant, Kakinada Plant and the Riverbank Facility, we will evaluate on an opportunistic basis the benefit of acquiring ownership stakes in other biofuel production facilities and entering into joint venture or licensing agreements with other ethanol, renewable diesel or renewable jet fuel facilities.
 
 Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive value opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies and processes advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of technologies that would be accretive to earnings.
 
  India
 
 Capitalize on recent policy changes by the Government of India. We plan to continue to pursue the traditional bulk, fleet, industrial, retail, and transportation biodiesel markets in India, which we believe have become more attractive as a result of potential changes to government tax structures and policies, as well as new marketing channels that may open as a result of changes to government policy changes. The rationalization of indirect taxation by the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (the “GST”), the introduction of biodiesel sales under government oil marketing company (“Government Oil Marketing Company”) contracts and the execution of contracts with major oil consumers are expected to drive revenue and margins in our India segment.

 Pursue tender offers from Government Oil Marketing Companies. In 2019, under the Indian government mandate of mixing biodiesel with diesel, the Kakinada Plant won the tender to supply biodiesel to Government Oil Marketing Companies such as Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, and Indian Oil Corporation and began supplying biodiesel in May 2019. These tenders open annually, usually in December, soliciting bids for the following year. We plan to continue to pursue these tender offers made by the Government Oil Market Companies on economically reasonable terms.
 
 Diversify our feedstocks from India. We designed our Kakinada Plant with the capability to produce biodiesel from multiple feedstocks. In 2009, we began to produce biodiesel from non-refined palm oil (“NRPO”). Between 2014 and 2019, we further diversified our feedstock to include animal oils and fats, which we used for the production of biodiesel to be sold into the European markets, refined, bleached & deodorized Palm Stearin, crude palm stearin, and RBD palm stearin. The byproduct of using high fat RBD palm stearin and crude palm stearin is Palm Fatty Acid Distiller (“PFAD”), which can be further processed into biodiesel and sold, or sold directly into the market starting in the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, the Kakinada Plant is capable of producing biodiesel from used cooking oil (“UCO”); however, the importation of UCO is not currently allowed in India, and as a result, we are looking for a local supply source of UCO to expand our feedstock diversity. In 2018, we completed a pretreatment unit at the Kakinada Plant to convert up to 5% high free fatty acid (“FFA”) feedstocks into oil that can be used to produce biodiesel, which was further upgraded in 2019 to convert up to 20% high FFA feedstocks, both of which are available at lower cost than our traditional feedstocks.
 
 Develop and commercially deploy technologies to produce high-margin products. We plan to continue investing in the conversion of lower quality, waste oils into higher value biofuels, including renewable diesel. Additionally, we continue to evaluate improvements to the throughput capacity and efficiency of the plant. We plan to invest in those areas that allow for more efficient and higher throughput for the processing of biodiesel and refined glycerin. The technologies for these conversion process may be licensed from third parties or internally developed.
 
 Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities. We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive earnings opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies and processes advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, or enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of accretive earnings business opportunities.
 
  2020 Highlights
 
  North America
 
 During 2020, we produced six products at the Keyes Plant: denatured fuel ethanol, high-grade alcohol for sanitizer, WDG, DCO, CO2, and CDS. During the first quarter of 2020, we started transitioning from selling 100% of the ethanol we produce pursuant to a purchase agreement with J.D. Heiskell (“J.D. Heiskell Purchase Agreement”), to a model where 100% of the ethanol is sold directly to Kinergy Marketing LLC (“Kinergy”). Since May 2020, the ethanol stored in our finished goods tank is 100% owned by Aemetis. WDG continue to be sold to A.L.Gilbert and DCO is sold to other customers under the J.D.Heiskell Purchase Agreement. Smaller amounts of CDS were sold to various local third parties. We began selling CO2 to Messer in the second quarter of 2020. We began selling high-grade alcohol for sanitizer in March 2020 directly to various customers throughout the West Coast and we also produced and sold Aemetis hand sanitizer under Aemetis Health Products, Inc. North American revenue is dependent on the price of ethanol, high-grade alcohol, WDG, and DCO.

 Ethanol pricing is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement with Kinergy and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area, California, as published by Oil Price Information Service, as well as quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with local fuel blenders. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement with A.L. Gilbert and is generally determined in reference to the local price of dried distillers grains (“DDG”) and other comparable feed products. Ethanol pricing is influenced by local and national inventory levels, local and national ethanol production, corn prices and gasoline demand. WDG is influenced by the price of corn, the supply and price of distillers dried grains, and demand from the local dairy and feed markets. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement with A.L. Gilbert and is generally determined in reference to the local price of DDG and other comparable feed products. High-grade alcohol pricing for sanitizer is based on the supply and demand restrictions in the current market. Our revenue is further influenced by our decision to operate the Keyes Plant at various capacity levels, conduct required maintenance, and respond to biological processes affecting output.  
 
  India
 
  In 2020, we primarily produced two products at the Kakinada Plant: biodiesel and refined glycerin produced from further processing of the crude glycerin produced as a by-product of the production of biodiesel. After the 2019 pretreatment unit upgrade, we can convert high-FFA oil into a renewable oil feedstock that that may be converted into biodiesel and sold to biodiesel market plants in India or exported to foreign plants to use for the production of biodiesel, renewable diesel and/or jet fuel. The byproduct of processing high-FFA oil into biodiesel is PFAD, which can be processed further into biodiesel or sold directly into the market starting in the third quarter of 2019.

  Competition
 
  North America
 
 According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (the “EIA”), there were approximately 200 operating commercial ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with a combined nameplate production of approximately 17.4 billion gallons per year as of January 1, 2020. The initial EIA U.S. ethanol production forecast for 2020 was approximately 16.2 billion gallons. However, the onset of the global pandemic at the end of the first quarter 2020 significantly impacted the production of U.S. ethanol, reducing industry capacity by approximately 12% vs. 2019. The production of ethanol is a commodity-based business where producers compete on the basis of price. We sell ethanol into the Northern California market. However, since insufficient production capacity exists in California to supply the state’s total fuel ethanol consumption (in excess of 1.5 billion gallons annually), we compete with ethanol transported into California from Midwestern producers. Similarly, our co-products, principally WDG and DCO, are sold into local California markets and compete with DDG and corn oil imported into the California markets as well as with alternative feed products.
 India
 
  With respect to biodiesel sold as fuel, we compete primarily with the producers of petroleum diesel, consisting of the three Government Oil Marketing Companies: Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and two private oil companies: Reliance Petroleum and Essar Oil, all of whom have significantly larger market shares than we do and control a significant share of the distribution network. These competitors also purchase our product for blending and further sales to their customers. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and reliable delivery, since our plant can produce distilled biodiesel and has historically been a more reliable and high-quality supplier than some other biodiesel producers in India.
 
  With respect to biodiesel sold directly to fleets and other customers, we supply logistics companies that operate fleets of trucks, ocean port facilities with extensive trucking activities, beverage distributors, cement ready-mix suppliers, mining companies, infrastructure companies, and other companies that use diesel for transportation.
 
  With respect to crude and refined glycerin, we compete with other glycerin producers and refiners selling products into the personal care, paints and adhesive markets primarily on the basis of price and product quality.
 
  Customers
 
  North America
 
 During the first quarter of 2020, we started transitioning from selling 100% of the ethanol we produce to J.D. Heiskell to selling the ethanol directly to Kinergy. Since May 2020, the ethanol stored in our finished goods tank is 100% owned by Aemetis. WDG continues to be sold to A.L.Gilbert and DCO is sold to other customers under the J.D.Heiskell Purchasing Agreement. Smaller amounts of CDS were sold to various local third parties. We began selling CO2 to Messer in the second quarter of 2020. We began selling high-grade alcohol for sanitizer in March 2020 directly to various customers throughout the West Coast and we also produced and sold Aemetis hand sanitizer under the Aemetis Health Products, Inc. North American revenue is dependent on the price of ethanol, high-grade alcohol, WDG, and DCO.
 India
 
  During 2020, we derived 87%, 8%, and 5% of our sales from biodiesel, refined glycerin, and other sales respectively. Two of our biodiesel customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues at 42% and 26%. None of our refined glycerin customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues in 2020. During 2019, we derived 89%, 6%, and 5% of our sales from biodiesel, refined glycerin, and other sales, respectively. Three of our biodiesel customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues at 33%, 15%, and 13%. Approximately 48% of the biodiesel revenue of our consolidated India segment revenues came from supplying Government Oil Marketing Companies under the 2019 tender contract. None of our refined glycerin customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India segment revenues in 2019.

  Pricing
 
  North America
 
 Ethanol pricing for the ethanol we sell to Kinergy is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement with Kinergy and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area, California, as published by Oil Price Information Service, as well as quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with local fuel blenders and available premiums for fuel with low carbon intensity as provided by California’s LCFS. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement with A.L. Gilbert and is generally determined in reference to the local price of DDG, corn and other comparable feed products. High-grade alcohol pricing is based on the supply and demand restrictions in the current sanitizer market. Our revenue is further influenced by our decision to operate the Keyes Plant at various capacity levels, conduct required maintenance, and respond to biological processes affecting output.
 
  Ethanol pricing for the ethanol we sell to Kinergy is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement between Kinergy and us and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area in California, as published by the Oil Price Information Service (“OPIS”), as well as the terms of quarterly contracts negotiated by Kinergy with local fuel blenders and available premiums for fuel with low carbon intensity as provided by California’s LCFS. The price for WDG is determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement between A.L. Gilbert and us and is generally determined in reference to the price of DDG, corn and other protein feedstuffs, based on local pricing in California’s Central Valley.
 
  India
 
  In India, the price of biodiesel is based on the price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets. In 2019, India changed to a daily dynamic pricing model where diesel prices are changed on daily basis by the Government Oil Marketing Companies. Biodiesel sold into Europe is based on the spot market price, but a recent Indian government ban on exports closed this market for the Company for the time being. We sell our biodiesel primarily to Government Oil Marketing Companies, transport companies, resellers, distributors and private refiners on an as-needed basis. We have no long-term sales contracts. Our biodiesel pricing is related to the price of petroleum diesel, and the increase in the price of petroleum diesel is expected to favorably impact the profitability of our India operations.
 Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
  North America
 
 We entered into a Corn Procurement and Working Capital Agreement with J.D. Heiskell in March 2011, which we amended in May 2020 (the “Heiskell Supply Agreement”). Under the Heiskell Supply Agreement, we agreed to procure number two yellow dent corn from J.D. Heiskell, with the ability to obtain corn from other sources subject to certain conditions. However, in 2019 and 2020, all our corn supply was purchased from J.D. Heiskell pursuant to the Heiskell Supply Agreement. Title to the corn and risk of loss pass to us when the corn is deposited into our weigh scale. The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2021, with automatic renewals for additional one-year terms.
 India
 
  In 2020, a significant amount of our biodiesel was derived from processing refined palm stearin, which was sourced locally. In 2019, a significant amount of our biodiesel was derived from processing crude palm stearin. The byproduct of using high fat RBD/crude palm stearin is PFAD, which can be processed further into biodiesel or sold directly as a product into the market starting in the third quarter of 2019. In addition to feedstock, the Kakinada Plant requires quantities of methanol and chemical catalysts for use in the biodiesel production process. These chemicals are also readily available and sourced from a number of suppliers surrounding the Kakinada Plant. We are not dependent on sole source or limited source suppliers for any of our raw materials or chemicals.

North American revenue is dependent on the price of ethanol, high-grade alcohol, WDG, and DCO.
 
  In March 2011, we entered into a WDG Purchase and Sale Agreement with A.L. Gilbert, pursuant to which A.L. Gilbert agreed to market, on an exclusive basis, all of the WDG we produce. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2021 with automatic one-year renewals.
 
 In October 2010, we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with Kinergy to market and sell our ethanol. The current term is set to expire on August 31, 2021 with automatic one-year renewals.
 
  India
 
  We sell our biodiesel and refined glycerin to (i) end-users utilizing our own sales force and independent sales agents, (ii) brokers who resell the product to end-users and (iii) Government Oil Marketing Companies. We pay a sales commission on sales arranged by independent sales agents.
 Commodity Risk Management Practices
 
  North America
 
  The cost of corn and the price of ethanol are volatile and the correlation of the pricing of these commodities form the basis for the profit margin at our Keyes Plant. We are, therefore, exposed to commodity price risk. Our risk management strategy is to operate in the physical market by purchasing corn and selling ethanol on a daily basis at the then prevailing market price. We monitor these prices daily to test for an overall positive variable contribution margin. We periodically explore and utilize methods of mitigating the volatility of our commodity prices. During 2019, we offered three-month WDG contracts to our customers, which we offset with the purchase of corn basis, allowing us to fix a portion of the margin at the Keyes Plant. Due to market volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we sold our WDG on a month-to-month basis to better manage commodity and pricing risk.
 India
 
  The cost of crude or refined palm stearin and the price of biodiesel are volatile and are generally uncorrelated. We therefore are exposed to ongoing and substantial commodity price risk at our Kakinada plant. Our risk management strategy is to produce biodiesel in India only when we believe we can generate positive gross margins and to idle the Kakinada Plant during periods of low or negative gross margins. Additionally, we are pursuing relationships with large oil companies and trading partners pursuant to which we may match the procurement of feedstocks with the production of biofuels for sales that provide a fixed margin.
 
  In addition, to minimize our commodity risk, we modified the processes within our facility to utilize lower cost crude palm stearin and palm based products with high FFA content, which enables us to reduce our feedstock costs. The price of our biodiesel is generally indexed to the local price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets.
 
  We have in the past, and we may in the future, use forward purchase contracts and other hedging strategies. However, the extent to which we engage in these risk management strategies may vary substantially from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors.

  Our research and development efforts consist of developing, evaluating, and commercializing technologies and expanding the production of cellulosic ethanol and other renewable bio-chemicals in the United States and India. The objective of this development activity is to bring efficient conversion technologies using waste feedstocks to produce biofuels and biochemicals on a large-scale, commercial basis. Some of our innovations are protected by issued or pending patents. We are developing additional technology and expect to file additional patents that will further strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. We expect to continue to file and protect patents related to our business and future plans.
 
  In 2018, in cooperation with a federally funded agency, we secured a grant from the California Energy Commission to optimize and demonstrate the effectiveness of ionic liquids technologies for breaking down biomass to produce cellulosic ethanol. After completion of technology development and pilot testing, this technology may be applied to launch the Carbon Zero production plants to commercialize this technology by converting the below zero carbon feedstocks such as waste wood and agricultural waste and renewable energy such as solar, RNG, biogas into energy dense liquid renewable fuels. A patent was awarded for this technology for the production of below zero carbon renewable fuel.
 
  Research and development expense was $0.2 million, for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 
  Patents and Trademarks
 
 We filed a number of trademark applications within the U.S.  We do not consider the success of our business, as a whole, to be dependent on these trademarks.  In addition, we hold nine awarded patents in the United States.  Our patents cover processes to break down plant biomass and a technology to convert carbon chain chemical structures.  We intend to develop, maintain and secure further intellectual property rights and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base.
  
 We have acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of the development and commercialization of our products, and we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technology in developing potential products.  We continue to place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and we are pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing products in development.
 
  We have received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”. Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, which could harm our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays in the development of our products, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may require us to license back our technology or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

  In January 2021, a U.S. patent was awarded for our exclusively licensed technology for the production of below zero carbon renewable fuel. This license enabled us to launch the Carbon Zero production plants that are designed to convert below zero carbon feedstocks such as waste wood and agricultural waste and renewable energy such as solar, RNG, and biogas into energy dense liquid renewable fuels. These renewable fuels can be utilized in hybrid electric cars or other electric engines which may create a below zero carbon greenhouse gas footprint across the entire life cycle of the fuel based on the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model, the leading lifecycle analysis measurement tool.

  Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
  North America
 
 The EPA finalized the 2020 renewable volume obligation (“RVO”) and associated percentage standards that apply under the RFS for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel.
 
 The final volumes requirements are set forth below and represent continued growth over historic levels. The final percentage standards meet or exceed the volume targets specified by Congress for total renewable fuel, biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel. To date, the EPA has not yet released the RVO for 2021.
 
 
 | Renewable Fuel Volume Requirements for 2017-2021
---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------
Year | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021
Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons) | 311 | 288 | 418 | 590 | n/a 
Biomass-based diesel (billion gallons) | 2.0 | 2.1 | 2.1 | 2.4 | 2.4 
Advanced biofuel (billion gallons) | 4.28 | 4.29 | 4.92 | 5.09 | n/a

  We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws, regulations and permits may, from time to time, require us to incur significant capital costs. These include, but are not limited to, testing and monitoring plant emissions, and where necessary, obtaining and maintaining mitigation processes to comply with regulations. They may also require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A significant violation of these laws, regulations, permits or license conditions could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.

  We are also subject to potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous wastes. If significant contamination is identified at our properties in the future, costs to investigate and remediate this contamination as well as costs to investigate or remediate associated damage could be significant. If any of these sites are subject to investigation and/or remediation requirements, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of such investigation and/or remediation, and for damage to natural resources. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from such properties. While costs to address contamination or related third-party claims could be significant, based upon currently available information, we are not aware of any such material contamination or third-party claims. Based on our current assessment of the environmental and regulatory risks, we have not accrued any-amounts for environmental matters as of December 31, 2020. The ultimate costs of any liabilities that may be identified or the discovery of additional contaminants could materially adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition.
 
  In addition, the production and transportation of our products may result in spills or releases of hazardous substances, which could result in claims from governmental authorities or third parties relating to actual or alleged personal injury, property damage, or damage to natural resources. We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses caused by our operations. Our general and umbrella liability policy coverage includes, but is not limited to, physical damage to assets, employer’s liability, comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation. We do not carry environmental insurance. We believe that our insurance is adequate for our industry, but losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of events which result in significant personal injury or damage to our property, natural resources or third parties that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
  Our air emissions are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, and similar state laws, which generally require us to obtain and maintain air emission permits for our ongoing operations as well as for any expansion of existing facilities or any new facilities. Obtaining and maintaining those permits requires us to incur costs, and any future more stringent standards may result in increased costs and may limit or interfere with our operating flexibility. These costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because other ethanol manufacturers in the U.S. are and will continue to be subject to similar laws and restrictions, we do not currently believe that our costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations will adversely affect our competitive position with other U.S. ethanol producers. However, because ethanol is produced and traded internationally, these costs could adversely affect us in our efforts to compete with foreign producers who are not subject to such stringent requirements.
 
  New laws or regulations relating to the production, disposal or emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may require us to incur significant additional costs with respect to ethanol plants that we build or acquire. We currently conduct our North American commercial activities exclusively in California. Climate change and reduction legislation is a topic of consideration by the U.S. Congress and California State Legislature, which may significantly impact the biofuels industry’s emissions regulations, as will the RFS, California’s LCFS, and other potentially significant changes in existing transportation fuels regulations.
 
  India
 
  We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including with respect to the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees. These laws may require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.

  Employees
 
  At December 31, 2020, we had a total of 164 employees, comprised of 15 full-time employees in our corporate offices, 43 full-time equivalent employees at the Keyes Plant, 4 full-time Aemetis Biogas employees and 102 full-time equivalent employees in India.
 
 We believe that our employees are highly skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are presently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are positive.
