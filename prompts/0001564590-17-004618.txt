Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology (“I-O”) company focused on the discovery and development of therapies that engage the body’s immune system to fight cancer. Our approach to cancer immunotherapy involves a diverse portfolio consisting of antibody-based therapeutics, adjuvants and cancer vaccine platforms. We, in collaboration with our partners, have developed a number of immuno-modulatory antibodies against important nodes of immune regulation. These include antibodies targeting CTLA-4, GITR and OX40 that are in clinical development, and our anti-PD-1 antibody anticipated to enter the clinic in the first half of 2017. Our discovery pipeline includes a number of proprietary checkpoint modulating (“CPM”) antibodies against innovative targets such as TIGIT and 4-1BB (also known as CD137). We believe that tailored combination therapies are essential to combat some of the most resistant cancers. Accordingly, our immune education strategy focuses on pursuing antibodies as well as vaccine candidates in conjunction with adjuvants. We believe we are uniquely positioned to treat cancers because we have a portfolio of product candidates and technologies that spans across these multiple therapeutic categories.
 
We are a vertically integrated biotechnology company equipped with a suite of technology platforms and a good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) manufacturing facility with the capacity to support early phase clinical programs. In addition to our broad and synergistic pipeline, we have established a world-class I-O research and clinical development team, including experts that have contributed to the development, in-licensing and registrational trajectory of staple antibody therapeutics such as Yervoy®, Avelumab and Humira®, among others.  
 
Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AGEN.”
 

Our Vision
 We envision combination therapies as the cornerstone of future oncology treatment regimens. In addition, we believe that a balanced portfolio of product candidates should focus on both validated targets as well as more novel, innovative targets. CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists have recently been recognized as the first clinically validated immunotherapy combination. Based on this finding, we believe that these two antibodies acting in combination, as well as other more innovative immuno-modulatory antibodies or immune education approaches, could be a focal point of the next generation of I-O combinations. Thus, we plan to pursue our proprietary PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibody programs aggressively through the clinic, and follow on with future combination therapies that integrate our cancer vaccine platforms as well as our antibodies against novel targets. One of our core visions is to substantially expand the small patient populations that benefit from existing immune-based therapies.
Our Strategy
 The breadth of our portfolio gives us the ability to combine our antibodies, vaccines, and adjuvants to explore and optimize cancer treatments. Our strategy is to develop these agents either alone or in combinations to yield best-in-class treatments. In addition, our clinical development strategy is tailored to achieve our goal of becoming a commercial organization in the next four years. We are pursuing a tiered risk profile and targeting compressed timelines for regulatory filing. We plan to adopt a rapid and de-risked path to registration by co-targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 in indications where blockade of these checkpoints has been found efficacious. In addition, we plan to pursue novel breakthrough indications to further expedite market entry. Second line cervical cancer is one such indication where we believe there is a niche opportunity in certain markets. In addition, our programs are anticipated to pose moderate regulatory risk and will entail: 1) pursuit of optimal I-O antibody and vaccine combinations with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 targeted antibodies as the backbone; 2) advancement of our antibody programs against innovative targets, such as 4-1BB and TIGIT, to the clinic alone or in combination with other products in our pipeline; and 3) continued advancement of vaccine candidate opportunities. Part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing arrangements with academic and corporate collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations.
Our Assets
 Our I-O assets include antibody-based therapeutics, adjuvants and cancer vaccine platforms. We believe that we are the third company, along with Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS”) and AstraZeneca, to have a CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor in the clinic. Once our PD-1 antagonist is in clinical development, we could be the only company, other than BMS, to feature both CTLA-4 and PD-1 assets in its clinical pipeline. To complement our portfolio of foundational CPMs, we have a number of antibody programs against more innovative targets involved in immune modulation. These include 4-1BB and TIGIT as well as a number of undisclosed targets with a potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class antibody-based therapeutics. We also have three proprietary cancer vaccine platforms: Prophage™ vaccine, AutoSynVax™ vaccine (“ASV”) and PhosphoSynVax™ vaccine (“PSV”). Additionally, our autologous 
 3

(Prophage) and synthetic (ASV™ and PSV™) vaccine candidates are protein complexes that consist of heat shock proteins (“HSPs”) and peptides that are either tumor-derived or tailor-made based on the unique genomic fingerprint of a patient’s tumor, respectively. Highlighting our combination treatment approach, a Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) is currently in progress to evaluate the efficacy of Prophage in combination with Merck’s PD-1 antagonist, Keytruda®, in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (“ndGBM”). Our QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant is partnered with GlaxoSmithKline plc. (“GSK”) and is a key component in multiple GSK vaccine programs that have a prophylactic or therapeutic impact in a variety of infectious diseases and cancer. 
 Our Antibody Discovery Platforms and CPM Programs
 Checkpoint antibodies regulate immune response against pathogens that invade the body and are achieving positive outcomes in a number of cancers that were untreatable only a few years ago. Two classes of checkpoint targets include:

1. | inhibitory checkpoints that help suppress an immune response in order to prevent excessive immune reaction resulting in undesired inflammation and/or auto-immunity, and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | stimulatory checkpoints that can enhance or amplify an antigen-specific immune response.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We possess a suite of antibody discovery platforms that have enabled us to improve the speed, cost and quality of our product development efforts. In addition to the use of our antibody discovery platforms that are designed to drive the discovery of future CPM antibody candidates, we are planning to employ a variety of techniques to identify and optimize our antibody candidates. For example, while we have been primarily focused on monoclonal antibodies over the past two years, we are beginning to explore multispecific antibody technologies, collaborations, and product candidate opportunities.  
 In April 2016, we presented preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) conference for our anti-CTLA-4 programs, AGEN1884 and AGEN2041 (both partnered with Recepta Biopharma SA (“Recepta”) for certain South American territories). The presentations covered preclinical pharmacology for each antibody, including detailed studies that demonstrate AGEN1884 and AGEN2041 bind to CTLA-4 expressed on T cells and potently block engagement of CD80 and CD86, leading to enhanced T cell responsiveness. We also reported data that AGEN1884 or AGEN2041 augmented vaccine response in primates. This finding demonstrates that both antibodies are functional and we believe exemplifies their utility in combination with therapeutic cancer vaccines. In 2017 at AACR, we plan to present evidence that our clinical-stage CTLA-4 antagonist (AGEN1884) combines effectively with our clinic-ready PD-1 antagonist antibody (AGEN2034) and other antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis to promote superior T cell immune responses compared to either monotherapy. Furthermore, in mice a surrogate CTLA-4 targeted antibody augments vaccine-induced immune responses when combined with our ASV vaccine candidate. In April 2016, we also announced that the first patient had been dosed in our Phase 1 clinical trial of AGEN1884. The open-label, multicenter trial in patients with advanced or refractory cancer is designed to evaluate the safety of AGEN1884 and determine the estimated maximum tolerated dose. In 2017, we plan to initiate combination trials with our clinical stage CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists and define the optimal dose of the combination for pivotal trials.   
 In the past year there has been third party validation of the clinical benefit of antibody combination approaches, most specifically the importance of targeting CTLA-4 as the backbone of these combination strategies. Regimens involving lower and less frequent dosing of CTLA-4 antibody in combination with PD-1 inhibitors have been shown to yield more pronounced clinical efficacy than either agent alone. Importantly, this was achieved without the added toxicity. Many experts believe that the combination of CTLA-4 antibodies with PD-1 blockade using a tolerable dosing regimen is a foundational I-O regimen. We expect our anti-PD-1 antibody candidate, AGEN2034, to enter the clinic in the first half of 2017. 
 We are planning to develop our anti-PD-1 antibody as a monotherapy as well as in combination with our anti CTLA-4 antibody in second line cervical cancer. Chemoradiation therapy is the current standard of care for earlier lines of treatment. In distant metastatic patients, platinum based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, is the current standard of care. However, there are no established therapies for second line cervical cancer and the five-year survival rate of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer is 16.8%. Cervical cancer is a malignancy that is driven by the persistent infection by certain types of human papilloma virus (“HPV”). Anti PD-1/PD-L1 have shown to be active in virally induced disease and, specifically, HPV induced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. In these tumors, anti PD-1 blockade might induce objective responses as well as prolongation of survival. 
 In addition to pursuing validated targets, our discovery pipeline also includes a number of antibody programs against innovative immunomodulatory targets such as TIGIT and 4-1BB (also known as CD137). 4-1BB is a co-stimulatory molecule involved in mediating recruitment of immune infiltrates into the tumor microenvironment. We have selected a lead agonist that targets this molecule, which exhibits compelling pharmacologic properties and could confer clinical advantages and poise this molecule to be a best-in-class therapeutic. TIGIT is a co-inhibitory checkpoint expressed on innate and adaptive immune cell populations. Preclinical models indicate that antibody-mediated TIGIT blockade not only serves to stimulate lymphocyte activation and cytotoxic activity, but also synergizes with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition to promote anti-tumor immunity. We have selected a lead molecule for this target that is advancing through preclinical development.

Partnered CPM Programs
 In January 2015, we entered into a broad, global alliance with Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”) to discover, develop and commercialize novel immuno-therapeutics using our antibody platforms. The collaboration was initially focused on four CPM programs targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3, and in November 2015, we expanded the alliance by adding three novel undisclosed CPM targets. Pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, Incyte made non-creditable, non-refundable upfront payments to us totaling $25.0 million. Targets under the collaboration were designated as either profit-share programs, where the parties shared all costs and profits equally, or royalty-bearing programs, where Incyte funded all costs, and we were eligible to receive milestones and royalties. Under the original collaboration agreement, programs targeting GITR, OX40 and two of the undisclosed targets were designated as profit-share programs, while the other targets were royalty-bearing programs. For each profit-share product, we were eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. For each royalty-bearing product, we were eligible to receive (i) up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones and (ii) tiered royalties on global net sales at rates generally ranging from 6%-12%. Concurrent with the execution of the original collaboration agreement, we and Incyte also entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Incyte purchased approximately 7.76 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million, or approximately $4.51 per share. In February 2017, we and Incyte amended the terms of the original collaboration agreement to, among other things, convert the GITR and OX40 programs from profit-share to royalty-bearing programs with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate for each. In addition, the profit-share programs relating to two undisclosed targets were removed from the collaboration, with one reverting to Incyte and one to Agenus (the latter being our TIGIT antibody program), each with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate. The remaining three royalty-bearing programs in the collaboration targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target remain unchanged, and there are no more profit-share programs under the collaboration. Pursuant to the amended agreement, we received accelerated milestone payments of $20.0 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist). Across all programs in the collaboration, we are now eligible to receive up to a total of $510.0 million in future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Concurrent with the execution of the amendment agreement, we and Incyte entered into a separate stock purchase agreement whereby Incyte purchased an additional 10 million shares of Agenus common stock at $6.00 per share. Immediately following the transaction, Incyte owned approximately 18.1% of our outstanding common stock.
 At the April 2016 AACR conference, we also presented data for two antibody candidates under the Incyte collaboration: INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist) and INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist). The presentations covered preclinical pharmacology for each antibody, including optimized features. INCAGN1949 and INCAGN1876 have been optimized to mediate receptor forward signaling under suboptimal T-cell receptor (“TCR”) stimulatory conditions, leading to enhanced agonistic properties and increased production of TNFα and IFNγ by immune effector cells. At AACR 2017, we are presenting additional preclinical data for both INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist) and INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) which further characterize these antibody candidates.  In June 2016, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INCAGN1876. The open-label, dose-escalation portion of the trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of INCAGN1876 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and will determine the pharmacologically active and/or maximum tolerated dose of INCAGN1876. Part 2 of the trial is planned to further evaluate the recommended dose of INCAGN1876 in selected tumor types, including advanced or metastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. In addition, in November 2016 we announced the commencement of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of INCAGN1949. The open-label, dose-escalation portion of the trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of INCAGN1949 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and will determine its pharmacologically active and/or maximum tolerated dose. Part 2 of the trial is planned to evaluate the recommended dose of INCAGN1949 in multiple tumor types.
 In addition, in April 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Merck to discover and optimize fully-human antibodies against two undisclosed CPM targets for which Merck could elect whether or not to proceed into development. Merck selected a lead product candidate against one of the undisclosed Merck targets to advance into preclinical studies, leading to a $2.0 million milestone payment that we received in May 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck is responsible for all future product development expenses for the selected antibody candidate. We are eligible to receive up to an additional $99.0 million in milestone payments, in addition to royalties on any worldwide product sales. 
 Recently we also formalized a research collaboration with UCB Biopharma SPRL (“UCB”). The collaboration leverages the antibody engineering capabilities of UCB and Agenus in the area of novel bispecific antibody discovery. We also continue to collaborate with Recepta on the development of antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1, and we expect to continue exploring additional future collaborations.
 Vaccine Platforms
 Our current vaccine platforms for the treatment of cancer, and potentially other indications, include our HSP based Prophage vaccine candidates, and our synthetic vaccine candidates, ASV and PSV. 
 5

HSPs are a group of proteins present at high levels in most mammalian cells. Their expression is increased when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or other stresses. A potential role for HSPs in regulating immune responses was revealed when it was first discovered that HSP complexes purified from cancer cells produced immunity to cancer, whereas HSP complexes purified from normal tissue did not. This discovery led to the understanding that HSPs bind to and carry a broad sampling of the protein environment within cells, including mutant proteins that might arise from genetic mutations within cancer cells. It was further shown that immunization with HSP complexes purified from tumors generate both CD4 and CD8 positive T-cell immune responses. These activated T-cells target the cancer cells of the tumor, from which the HSP complexes were derived, for destruction. Thus HSP complexes isolated from cancer cells are particularly effective in mediating successive immunization. Since HSPs are expressed in all tumor cells, the approach of immunizing with the HSP complexes isolated from a particular tumor is broadly applicable to a variety of cancer types. We believe that we pioneered the use of gp96, an HSP, purified from a patient’s own tumor tissue, as a way to make vaccines tailored to eliciting immune recognition and potential immune control of an individual patient’s cancer.
 Because cancer is a highly variable disease from one patient to another, due to extensive mutation of cancer cells, we believe that a patient-specific vaccination approach is optimal to generate a more robust and targeted immune response against the disease. 
 Prophage Vaccine Candidates
 Our Prophage cancer vaccine candidate, HSPPC-96, is an autologous cancer vaccine therapy derived from cancer tissues that are surgically removed from an individual patient. As a result, a Prophage vaccine contains a broad sampling of potentially antigenic mutant proteins from each patient’s own tumor. Prophage vaccines are designed to program the body’s immune system to target only the specific cells that express those mutant antigens, thereby reducing the risk that the body’s immune response against the tumor after vaccination will also affect healthy tissue and cause debilitating side effects often associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
 Enhancing immune response using personalized vaccines, particularly in combination with CPMs, could be beneficial in cancers where a low number of mutant proteins leads to weakened immunogenicity. Glioblastoma (“GBM”) represents one such example and is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, accounting for the majority of diagnoses of malignant cancers of the brain. GBM is a cancer affecting the central nervous system arising from glial cells that become malignant, and is at present a rapidly fatal disease. 
 To date, more than 1,000 patients have been treated with Prophage vaccines in clinical trials, covering a broad range of cancer types, and no serious immune-mediated side effects have been observed. The results of these trials have been published and/or presented at scientific conferences. These results indicate observable clinical and/or immunological activity across many types of cancer. Taken together, these trials show promising evidence of clinical benefit from Prophage vaccines and also establish that such vaccines can be effectively manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), conditions and internationally distributed.
 In January 2017, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with the NCI. The double-blind, randomized controlled Phase 2 trial will evaluate the effect of Prophage in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) in patients with ndGBM. The trial is being conducted by the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (“BTTC”), a consortium of top academic centers led by Dr. Mark Gilbert, Chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NCI Center for Cancer Research. The trial consists of two-arms with one arm receiving pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and a second arm receiving both Prophage and pembrolizumab in combination. Forty-five patients are being randomly assigned to each arm. Under this collaboration, we are suppling Prophage, Merck is providing pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) and NCI and BTTC member sites are recruiting patients and conducting the trial. 
 At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) conference in 2015, we announced final results from a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial in 46 patients with ndGBM treated with our Prophage vaccine in combination with standard of care: surgical resection, radiation and temozolomide. These results showed that patients treated with Prophage vaccine had a median progression free survival (“PFS”) of 18 months, with 33% of patients progression free at 24 months and indicate improvement compared to historical data for patients treated with the standard of care (PFS of six to nine months). Median overall survival (“OS”), the primary endpoint of the trial, was 23.8 months and remains durable in patients treated with Prophage. These data were published on February 13, 2017, in a manuscript in Clinical Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.

In addition to studies with ndGBM patients, we also previously reported data on recurrent GBM patients treated with Prophage. In December 2013, we published our Phase 2 results demonstrating that more than 90% of the patients treated with Prophage vaccine were alive at six months after surgery and 30% were alive at 12 months after surgery. Additionally, the median overall survival was approximately 11 months. This compared favorably to historical control data with expected median survival for recurrent GBM patients of three to nine months. The data were published in a manuscript in Neuro-Oncology, the official journal of the Society of Neuro-Oncology. In addition, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, a cooperative group of the NCI, was conducting a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of the Prophage vaccine in combination with bevacizumab in 222 patients with surgically resectable, recurrent GBM. This study was recently closed following an interim analysis that determined the study was unlikely to demonstrate that the vaccine in combination with bevacizumab would lead to a better survival than bevacizumab as a monotherapy. 
 ASV Vaccine Platform
 In June 2014, we reported positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial with our synthetic HerpV vaccine candidate for genital herpes. This candidate was the first potential recombinant, off-the-shelf application of our HSP technology. The study demonstrated that the HSP70-peptide-QS21 vaccine produced significant CD4 and CD8 positive T-cell responses to antigenic peptides, and that the side effects were mild to moderate and tolerable. We decided not to advance with this technology in herpes but, based on our findings, we launched our ASV synthetic cancer vaccine program in 2015. We remain on target to initiate a clinical trial for this program in the first half of 2017.
 The objective of our ASV program is to develop a fully synthetic, yet individualized patient specific vaccine targeting the neo-epitope landscape of each patient’s cancer. Mutation-based neo-epitopes, which will form the basis for the immunogens used in ASV, are almost always particular to a given patient. Therefore, ASV is a largely individualized vaccine product. With a small amount of a patient’s tumor as a sample, our ASV program is designed to utilize next generation sequencing technologies coupled with complex bioinformatics algorithms to identify mutations in a tumor’s DNA and RNA. Once these mutations have been identified, we will manufacture synthetic peptides encoding these neoepitopes, load these peptides on to our recombinant HSP70 and deliver a fully synthetic polyvalent vaccine to the patient. We believe that the HSP70 platform will shuttle the mutated peptides to sites where they are recognized by the immune system and elicit a cytotoxic and helper T cell response in patients with cancer. We expect that once identified, these tumor cells will be killed and cleared by the immune system.
 PSV Vaccine Platform
 PSV is a vaccine candidate designed to induce immunity against a novel class of tumor specific neoepitopes: those arising from dysregulated phosphorylation of various proteins in malignant cells, rather than from tumor-specific mutations producing abnormal protein sequences. In all cells, protein sequences can have post-translational modifications, such as becoming phosphorylated (a phosphate group is added to particular amino acid residues) that can be associated with cellular functions such as signaling. In cancer cells, this process can become dysregulated and proteins that are not normally phosphorylated can become phosphorylated and proteins that are phosphorylated can become phosphorylated at alternative sites. Some of these mis-phosphorylated peptides can be processed by the cellular machinery that leads to antigen presentation on the surface of cells, and there they can potentially be recognized by specific cytotoxic T cells. Such phosphoprotein neoepitopes have been associated with different forms of cancer, including but not limited to lung cancer, specific leukemias, ovarian cancer, colon cancer and others. PSV is intended to induce cellular immunity to abnormal phosphopeptide neoepitopes that are characteristic of these various forms of cancer. Phosphopeptides (or phosphopeptide analogues) can be synthesized and complexed with HSP70, using an approach analogous to that used in the generation of our previous HerpV vaccine candidate. HerpV demonstrated good cellular and humoral responses to synthetic peptide immunogens complexed with HSP70 in a placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. We believe that similar responses can be obtained to phosphopeptide or phosphopeptide analogues bound to HSP70 when used as vaccines. Phosphorylation-based neoepitopes can apparently be found on specific types of cancer in many patients, suggesting that the immunogens used in PSV, while tailored to a particular patient, will be useful in other patients with related forms of cancer. Studies to optimize the immunogens to be used in PSV are ongoing.
QS-21 Stimulon Adjuvant
 QS-21 Stimulon is an adjuvant, which is a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance an immune response to the target antigens. QS-21 Stimulon is a natural product, a triterpene glycoside, or saponin, purified from the bark of the Chilean soapbark tree, Quillaja saponaria. QS-21 Stimulon has the ability to stimulate an antibody-mediated immune response and has also been shown to activate cellular immunity. It has become a key component in the development of investigational preventive vaccine formulations across a wide variety of diseases. These studies have been carried out by academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. A number of these studies have shown QS-21 Stimulon to be significantly more effective in stimulating immune responses than aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, the adjuvants most commonly used in approved vaccines in the United States today.

Partnered QS-21 Stimulon Programs
 In July 2006, we entered into a license agreement and a supply agreement with GSK for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK License Agreement” and the “GSK Supply Agreement,” respectively). In January 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Manufacturing Technology Transfer and Supply Agreement (the “Amended GSK Supply Agreement”) under which GSK has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon. GSK is obligated to supply us, or our affiliates, licensees, or customers, certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon for a stated period of time. In March 2012, we entered into a First Right to Negotiate and Amendment Agreement amending the GSK License Agreement and the Amended GSK Supply Agreement to clarify and include additional rights for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement”). In addition, we granted GSK the first right to negotiate for the purchase of Agenus or certain of our assets, which just recently expired in March 2017. As consideration for entering into the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement, GSK paid us an upfront, non-refundable payment of $9.0 million, $2.5 million of which is creditable toward future royalty payments. We refer to the GSK License Agreement, the Amended GSK Supply Agreement and the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement collectively as the GSK Agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we had received $23.3 million of a potential $24.3 million in upfront and milestone payments under the GSK Agreements. Under the terms of the Agreement, we are generally entitled to receive 2% royalties on net sales of prophylactic vaccines for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of a resulting GSK product, with some exceptions; however, we have already monetized part of this potential royalty stream as discussed in more detail below. The GSK License and Amended GSK Supply Agreements may be terminated by either party upon a material breach if the breach is not cured within the time specified in the respective agreement. The termination or expiration of the GSK License Agreement does not relieve either party from any obligation which accrued prior to the termination or expiration. Among other provisions, the milestone payment obligations survive termination or expiration of the GSK Agreements for any reason, and the license rights granted to GSK survive expiration of the GSK License Agreement. The license rights and payment obligations of GSK under the Amended GSK Supply Agreement survive termination or expiration, except that GSK's license rights and future royalty obligations do not survive if we terminate due to GSK's material breach unless we elect otherwise.
 QS-21 Stimulon is a key component included in certain of GSK's proprietary adjuvant systems, and we believe that a number of GSK's vaccine candidates currently in development are formulated using adjuvant systems containing QS-21 Stimulon, including its shingles and malaria vaccine candidates which have successfully completed Phase 3 clinical trials. In 2016, GSK filed for approval of its shingles vaccine candidate in the United States, European Union and Canada, and is expected to file for approval in Japan in 2017. In December 2014, GSK reported that its ZOE-50 Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of its shingles vaccine candidate, HZ/su, met its primary endpoint. Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that HZ/su reduced the risk of shingles by 97.2% in adults aged 50 years and older compared to placebo. In addition, GSK has reported two positive Phase 3 clinical trials of its RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate containing QS-21 Stimulon, which was accepted by the EMA for regulatory review in July 2014. Assuming regulatory approval, the first products containing QS-21 Stimulon are anticipated to be launched by GSK in 2018. We do not incur clinical development costs for products partnered with GSK. Our other previous licensee, Janssen Science Ireland UC, terminated its license for use of QS-21 Stimulon in May 2016.    
 In September 2015, we monetized a portion of the royalties associated with the GSK License Agreement to an investor group led by Oberland Capital Management for up to $115.0 million in the form of a non-dilutive royalty transaction. Under the terms of a Note Purchase Agreement with the investor group (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) we received $100.0 million at closing for which the investors will have the right to receive 100% of our worldwide royalties under the GSK License Agreement on sales of GSK’s shingles (HZ/su) and malaria (RTS,S) prophylactic vaccine products that contain our QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant to pay down principle and interest. Once all principle and interest under the Note Purchase Agreement has been paid, any and all remaining royalties from the GSK License Agreement will accrue to us. The Note Purchase Agreement is designed to allow us to capture both the near and longer term benefit associated royalties from GSK’s vaccine products containing our QS-21 Stimulon. At our option, we are entitled to receive an additional $15.0 million in cash from the investors after approval of HZ/su by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), provided such approval does not occur later than June 30, 2018. Also at our option, we have the right to buy back the loan at any time under pre-specified terms. The monetization of these royalty rights allows us to advance a significant portion of the future value of our royalty stream while still allowing us to retain any future monetary upside after the Note Purchase Agreement terms have been satisfied.
 Manufacturing 
 Manufacturing CPM Antibodies
 We rely on third party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to manufacture and supply us with the antibodies and drug substance for our antibody programs and anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future. In an effort to de-risk this reliance, we acquired XOMA Corporation’s antibody manufacturing pilot plant in Berkeley, CA in December 2015. A team of former XOMA employees with valuable chemistry, manufacturing and controls experience joined us and continues to operate the facility. The pilot plant, referred to as “Agenus West,” was acquired to enable us to manufacture antibodies for some of our own CPM programs and those of existing and potential third party collaborators. Since the acquisition, we have refurbished and improved the pilot plant, 
 8

increasing both scale and capacity, with the anticipation that it will be able to provide antibody production development expertise and antibody drug substance to support clinical proof-of-concept studies, and facilitate some of our future GMP antibody production requirements. We also expect to utilize our Agenus West pilot plant capabilities to accelerate antibody delivery speed, improve quality and increase product yield while providing us with greater manufacturing flexibility, all at reduced costs. We believe our Agenus West pilot plant manufacturing facility could accelerate the time to the clinic and into product commercialization. In addition, in February 2017, we amended our collaboration with Incyte, transferring manufacturing responsibilities for all antibodies under the collaboration to them. This includes antibodies targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target. We are in the process of transferring manufacturing know how to Incyte to support these endeavors.
 Manufacturing Cancer Vaccines
 We manufacture our cancer vaccine candidates from our different vaccine platforms in our Lexington, MA facility. 
 Each Prophage vaccine is manufactured using a patient’s own tumor. After the patient undergoes surgery to remove cancerous tumor tissue, the tumor is shipped frozen in a specially designed kit provided by us to our Lexington, Massachusetts facility. Each Prophage vaccine is produced to a specific standard, in a process taking approximately ten hours, after which it undergoes extensive quality testing for approximately two weeks. The turnaround time from the date of surgery to delivery of vaccine is approximately three to four weeks, which generally fits well with the patient’s recovery time from surgery. Once we release the vaccine, it is shipped frozen overnight to the hospital pharmacy or clinician. Prophage vaccines are given as a simple intradermal injection. 
 ASV and PSV vaccine candidates would be manufactured using HSP70 loaded with synthetic peptide synthesized by approved manufacturers. The sequence of the peptides is determined by sequencing and analysis of patient and tumor DNA and RNA and run through complex algorithms by our bioinformatics group who have specialized knowledge of the attributes required to elicit immune responsiveness. This process takes several weeks, after which the manufactured vaccine undergoes extensive quality testing, including sterility testing, for a further two weeks.
 We have established, within a single facility, well-defined, cost efficient manufacturing under GMPs, including bioanalytical, quality control and quality assurance, logistics, distribution and supply chain management. After manufacturing, Prophage and ASV vaccine candidates are tested and released by our analytical and quality systems staff. The quality control organization performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that the product meets all applicable specifications. Our quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with current GMP (“cGMP”) as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies.
 Our manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent vaccine output. Our quality control and quality assurance staff is similarly trained and evaluated as part of our effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities.
 QS-21 Stimulon
 Except in the case of GSK, we have retained worldwide manufacturing rights for QS-21 Stimulon, and we have the right to subcontract manufacturing for QS-21 Stimulon. In addition, under the terms of our agreement with GSK, upon request by us, GSK is committed to supply certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon to us and our licensees for a fixed period of time.
Intellectual Property Portfolio 
 We seek to protect our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets and know-how, and we currently own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 40 issued United States patents and approximately 125 issued foreign patents. Our issued patents include those that cover uses of our core technologies in combination with other agents. Such core technologies include HSP-based vaccines for the treatment of cancers and treatment/prevention of infectious diseases, and saponin adjuvants. We also own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 35 pending United States patent applications and approximately 80 pending foreign patent applications. We may not have rights in all territories where we may pursue regulatory approval for Prophage vaccine candidates.
  Through various acquisitions, we own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to a number of patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including methods for identifying therapeutic antibodies and product candidates arising out of such entities’ technology platforms. In particular, we own patents and patent applications relating to our Retrocyte Display technology platform, a high throughput antibody expression platform for the identification of fully-human and humanized monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2029 and 2031. We own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including a patent directed to methods for identifying phosphorylated 
 9

proteins using mass spectrometry. This patent is projected to expire in 2023. We also own patents and patent applications relating to the SECANT® platform, a platform used for the generation of novel monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2028 and 2029. In addition, as we advance our research and development efforts with our institutional and corporate collaborators, we are seeking patent protection for certain newly identified therapeutic antibodies and product candidates. We can provide no assurance that any of our patents, including the patents that we acquired or in-licensed, will have commercial value, or that any of our existing or future patent applications, including the patent applications that were acquired or in-licensed, will result in the issuance of valid and enforceable patents. Our issued patents covering Prophage vaccine and methods of use thereof, alone or in combination with other agents, expired or will expire at various dates between 2015 and 2024. In particular, our issued U.S. patents covering Prophage composition of matter expired in 2015. In addition, our issued patents covering QS-21 Stimulon composition of matter expired in 2008. We continue to explore means of extending the life cycle of our patent portfolio. 
 Various patents and patent applications have been exclusively licensed to us by the following entities:
 University of Virginia
 In connection with our acquisition of PhosImmune in December 2015, we obtained exclusive rights to a portfolio of patent applications and one issued patent relating to PTTs under a patent license agreement with the University of Virginia (“UVA”). The UVA license gives us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the PTT technology and an exclusive option to license any further PTT technology arising from ongoing research at UVA until December 2018. Under the license agreement, we will pay low to mid-single digit running royalties on net sales of PTT products, and a modest flat percentage of sublicensing income. In addition, we may be obligated to make milestone payments of up to $2.7 million for each indication of a licensed PTT product to complete clinical trials and achieve certain sales thresholds. The term of the UVA license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires or becomes no longer valid. The UVA license agreement may be terminated as follows: (i) by UVA in connection with our bankruptcy or cessation of business relating to the licensed technology, (ii) by UVA if we commit a material, uncured breach or (iii) by us for our convenience on 180 days written notice. 
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 On December 5, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Switzerland Inc. (formerly known as 4-Antibody AG)(“4-AB”), entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd. (“Ludwig”), which replaced and superseded a prior agreement entered into between the parties in May 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ludwig granted 4-AB an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights of Ludwig and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center arising from the prior agreement to further develop and commercialize GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 antibodies. On January 25, 2016, we and 4-AB entered into a second license agreement with Ludwig, on substantially similar terms, to develop CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies. Pursuant to the December 2014 license agreement, 4-AB made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to Ludwig. The December 2014 license agreement also obligates 4-AB to make potential milestone payments of up to $20.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of licensed GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 products, and potential milestone payments in excess of $80.0 million if such licensed products are approved in multiple jurisdictions, in more than one indication, and certain sales milestones are achieved. Under the January 2016 license agreement, we are obligated to make potential milestone payments of up to $12.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of CTLA-4 and PD-1 licensed products, and potential milestone payments of up to $32.0 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. Under each of these license agreements, we and/or 4-AB will also be obligated to pay low to mid-single digit royalties on all net sales of licensed products during the royalty period, and to pay Ludwig a percentage of any sublicensing income, ranging from a low to mid-double digit percentage depending on various factors. The license agreements may each be terminated as follows: (i) by either party if the other party commits a material, uncured breach; (ii) by either party if the other party initiates bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings; or (iii) by 4-AB or us (as applicable) for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The license agreements also contain customary representations and warranties, mutual indemnification, confidentiality and arbitration provisions.
University of Connecticut Health Center
 In May 2001, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Connecticut Health Center (“
UConn”) which was amended in March 2003 and June 2009. Through the license agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to patent rights resulting from inventions discovered under a research agreement that was effective from February 1998 until December 2006. The term of the license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires in 2028 or becomes no longer valid. UConn may terminate the agreement: (1) if, after 30 days written notice for breach, we continue to fail to make any payments due under the license agreement, or (2) we cease to carry on our business related to the patent rights or if we initiate or conduct actions in order to declare bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice. We are required to make royalty payments on any obligations created prior to the effective date of termination of the license agreement. Upon expiration or termination of the license agreement due to breach, we have the right to continue to manufacture and sell products covered under the license agreement which are considered to be works in progress for a period of six months. The license agreement contains aggregate milestone payments of 
 10

approximately for each product we develop covered by the licensed patent rights. These milestone payments are contingent upon regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, and commercial sales of products. We have also agreed to pay UConn a royalty on the net sales of products covered by the license agreement as well as annual license maintenance fees beginning in May 2006. Royalties otherwise due on the net sales of products covered by the license agreement may be credited against the annual license maintenance fee obligations. Under the March 2003 amendment, we agreed to pay UConn an upfront payment and to make future payments for each patent or patent application with respect to which we exercised our option under the research agreement. As of December 31, 2016, we had paid approximately $850,000 to UConn under the license agreement. The license agreement gives us complete discretion over the commercialization of products covered by the licensed patent rights but also requires us to use commercially reasonable diligent efforts to introduce commercial products within and outside the United States. If we fail to meet these diligence requirements, UConn may be able to terminate the license agreement.
 Regulatory Compliance
 Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of our investigational product candidates. In the United States, the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical products to rigorous review.
 In order to obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit proof of safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product. In most cases, this proof entails extensive preclinical, clinical, and laboratory tests. Before approving a new drug or marketing application, the FDA may also conduct pre-licensing inspections of the company, its contract research organizations and/or its clinical trial sites to ensure that clinical, safety, quality control, and other regulated activities are compliant with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), or Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), for specific non-clinical toxicology studies. The FDA may also require confirmatory trials, post-marketing testing, and extra surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products, or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Once approved, the labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a drug or biologic product must be in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements.
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the sponsor tests the product in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. In Phase 2, in addition to safety, the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
 The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in the form of a new drug application (“NDA”), or in the case of biologics, like the Prophage vaccines, a biologics license application (“BLA”). In a process that can take a year or more, the FDA reviews this application and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the new compound is both safe and effective for a particular indication and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing.
 Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, we must generally obtain approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of international jurisdictions prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those jurisdictions. We are also subject to cGMP, GCP, and GLP compliance obligations and are subject to inspection by international regulatory authorities. International requirements may in some circumstances be more rigorous than U.S. requirements and may require additional investment in manufacturing process development, non-clinical studies, clinical studies, and record keeping that are not required for U.S. regulatory compliance or approval. The time required to obtain this approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and can also require significant resources in time, money and labor.
 Under the laws of the United States, the countries of the European Union and other nations, we and the institutions where we sponsor research are subject to obligations to ensure the protection of personal information of human subjects participating in our clinical trials. We have instituted procedures that we believe will enable us to comply with these requirements and the contractual requirements of our data sources. The laws and regulations in this area are evolving, and further regulation, if adopted, could affect the timing and the cost of future clinical development activities.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, various radioactive compounds, and for some experiments we use recombinant DNA. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by local, state, and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. We conduct our activities in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.

Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products for the treatment of cancer.
 Many competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, and technical resources, and more experience in research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory matters, than we do. Competing companies developing or acquiring rights to more efficacious therapeutic products for the same diseases we are targeting, or which offer significantly lower costs of treatment, could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete. See Part I-Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business-Our competitors may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources.”
 Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research institutions conduct significant amounts of research in biotechnology, medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting and retaining skilled scientific talent.
 The CPM landscape is crowded with several competitors developing assets against a number of targets. Development plans are spread out across various indications and lines of therapy, either alone or in combination with other assets. Competitors range from small cap to large cap companies, with assets in preclinical or clinical stages of development. Therefore, the landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. We and our partners have CPM antibody programs currently in clinical stage development targeting CTLA-4, GITR and OX40, with our PD-1 antagonist anticipated to enter into the clinic in the first half of this year. We are aware of many companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed to the same biological targets as these programs, including, without limitation, the following: (1) BMS markets ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and is developing agonists to GITR and OX-40, (2) Merck has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody in the United States, and is developing an anti-GITR agonist, (3) Ono Pharmaceuticals has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody in Japan, (4) AstraZeneca/Medimmune has anti-CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, GITR and OX40 targeting antibodies in development, (5) Pfizer has anti-PD-L1 (with Merck KgA), anti-PD-1, and anti-OX40 antibodies in clinical development, (6) Novartis has anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibodies in clinical trials, and (7) Roche/Genetech has an approved anti-PD-L1 and an anti-OX40 antibody in clinical development. We are also aware of other competitors with PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in clinical development, including Tesaro, Beigene, Regeneron, CureTech, Eli Lilly, Jiangsu HengRui Medicine, Shanghai Junshi and Macrogenics. We are also aware of competitors with preclinical antibodies against these targets. In addition, we are also aware of competitors with clinical stage antibodies against targets in our earlier stage programs such as TIM-3, LAG-3, 4-1BB, TIGIT and other undisclosed targets. These include, but are not limited to, BMS, Pfizer, Novartis, Merck, Roche, Tesaro and Regeneron. Additionally, we are also aware of competitors with assets against these targets that are in preclinical development. There is no guarantee that our antibody product candidates will be able to compete with our competitors’ antibody products and product candidates. 
 We are planning to develop our anti PD-1 as a monotherapy as well as in combination with our anti CTLA-4 antibody in second line cervical cancer. We are aware of exploratory, industry sponsored clinical trials that are underway in cervical cancer. Our competitors include, but are not restricted to, Merck (anti-PD-1), Ono Pharmaceuticals and BMS (anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-LAG-3), and Advaxis (HPV targeting vaccine alone or in combination with AstraZeneca’s anti-PD-L1 antibody). Additionally, we are also aware of cervical cancer clinical trials exploring other CPM targets including, but not restricted to, PD-L1 + IDO (Roche), VISTA (Janssen), OX40 +/- 4-1BB (Pfizer). However, given the stage, focus, expected efficacy and safety profile of our development programs versus those of our competitors, we believe that our approach provides a fast to market opportunity that will allow us to establish a favorable competitive position.
 We have autologous vaccines programs in development including our Prophage vaccine in clinical development for GBM and our neo-antigen based AutoSynVax vaccine in preclinical development. We are aware of many companies pursuing personalized cancer vaccines in preclinical or clinical development, including, without limitation, the following: Neon Therapeutics, Gritstone Oncology, Advaxis, BioNTech, Moderna and Merck, Nouscom, Immatics and Green Peptides. 
 Several companies have products that utilize similar technologies and/or patient-specific medicine techniques that compete with our HSP based vaccines. For treatment of recurrent glioma, Roche markets bevacizumab and Eisai and Arbor Pharmaceuticals market carmustine. Schering Corporation, a subsidiary of Merck, markets temozolomide for treatment of patients with ndGBM and refractory astrocytoma. Other companies are developing vaccines for the treatment of patients with ndGBM, such as Green Cross Cell - formerly 
 12

Innocell Corp (Immuncell-LC), ImmunoCellular Therapeutics (ICT-107), Northwest Biotherapeutics (DC-Vax), Mimivax Inc. (SurVaxM), Annias Immunotherapeutics (CMV Vaccine) and Activartis Biotech (GBM-Vax). In addition, TVAX Biomedical, Stemline Therapeutics and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma are developing immunotherapy candidates TVI-Brain-1, SL-701 and DSP-7888, respectively, for recurrent glioma. Other companies may begin development programs as well. 
 To the extent we develop our vaccines in other indications or in combination with other product candidates, such as available standard of care agents (Avastin®), or with CPMs, they could face additional competition in those indications or in those combinations. In addition, and prior to regulatory approval, if ever, our vaccines and our other product candidates may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer and infectious disease therapies continue to accelerate. 
 We are aware of compounds that claim to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon that are being used in clinical trials. Several other vaccine adjuvants are in development and could compete with QS-21 Stimulon for inclusion in vaccines in development. These adjuvants include, but are not limited to, (1) oligonucleotides, under development by Pfizer, Idera, Colby, and Dynavax, (2) MF59, under development by Novartis, (3) IC31, under development by Intercell (now part of Valneva), and (4) MPL, under development by GSK. In the past, we have provided QS-21 Stimulon to other entities under materials transfer arrangements. In at least one instance, it is possible that this material was used unlawfully to develop synthetic formulations and/or derivatives of QS-21. In addition, companies such as Adjuvance Technologies, Inc., CSL Limited, and Novavax, Inc., as well as academic institutions and manufacturers of saponin extracts, are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. These sources may be competitive to our ability to execute future partnering and licensing arrangements involving QS-21 Stimulon. The existence of products developed by these and other competitors, or other products of which we are not aware or which other companies may develop in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed or sold using QS-21 Stimulon.
 We are also aware of a third party that manufactures pre-clinical material purporting to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon. The claims being made by this third party may create marketplace confusion and have an adverse effect on the goodwill generated by us and our partners with respect to QS-21 Stimulon. Any diminution of this goodwill may have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize future products, if any, incorporating this technology, either alone or with a third party.
