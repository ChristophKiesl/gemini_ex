Overview
 Talis aims to transform diagnostic testing by developing and commercializing innovative products that are designed to enable accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing for infectious diseases and other conditions at the point-of-care. While timely diagnosis of infectious diseases is critically important to enable effective treatment, testing is primarily performed in centralized laboratories, which require samples to be shipped for processing, delaying the return of results by days. Point-of-care testing solves this problem by delivering the timely information necessary for clinical care. We are developing the Talis One system, a sample-to-answer, cloud-enabled molecular diagnostic platform that, once authorized, could be rapidly deployed to distributed diagnostic settings in the United States and around the world to diagnose infectious disease at the point-of care. The Talis One system comprises a compact instrument, single-use test cartridges and software, including a central cloud database, which work together and are designed to provide central laboratory levels of accuracy and be operated by an untrained user. 
General 
 We are developing Talis One assay kits for respiratory infections, infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections. In January 2021, we submitted a request for an EUA to the FDA for our Talis One system with COVID-19 molecular diagnostic assay in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)-moderate settings. In late February 2021, the FDA informed the company that it cannot ensure the comparator assay used in the primary study has sufficient sensitivity to support our EUA application.  On March 8, 2021 we announced that we withdrew our January application in favor of focusing on an application to authorize testing at the point-of-care. In late March 2021, we made certain changes to our clinical validation strategy in a point-of-care environment, and now intend to submit a request for EUA to the FDA for our Talis One system in non-laboratory settings in Q2 2021. This assay platform provides for the automated detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab samples from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. By submitting for the equivalent of a CLIA-waived authorization, if authorization is received from the FDA, the Talis One COVID-19 assay kit may be used in either laboratory or non-laboratory settings. 
 We are also developing influenza A and influenza B tests to be included as part of a respiratory panel with our COVID-19 assay (COVID-Flu Panel). In addition, we plan to initiate a clinical trial to support clearance of a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of our Talis One system with a test cartridge for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the second half of 2021 and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification in the first half of 2022. To support our anticipated commercial launch of our COVID-19 assay kit, we have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million cartridges per month, which began to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021 and we expect will scale to full capacity through 2021. 
 The COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the adoption of point-of-care platforms in both traditional and non-traditional care settings, and we believe the Talis One system is well positioned to meet this growing demand. While a variety of technologies are commercially available, we believe that few, if any, sufficiently meet the needs of healthcare providers in order to drive broad adoption of, and transition to, point-of-care testing for infectious diseases. For example, antigen detection technologies, which detect proteins from the pathogen, are rapid and relatively low cost, but they have higher limits of detection. Molecular technologies that detect nucleic acids are generally considered highly accurate for infectious disease testing. However, we believe that some currently available point-of-care molecular technologies have sacrificed accuracy to increase speed. Lower accuracy limits a test’s utility, particularly in the case of testing for dangerous infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, for which an incorrect test result can have severe consequences. We believe that the ideal point-of-care technology for diagnosing 
 4



infectious diseases would not only be highly accurate and rapid, but would also be easy to use, low cost, cloud-compatible and enable multiplexing to detect multiple pathogens at the same time.
 We are developing the Talis One system to address limitations of existing point-of-care diagnostic testing technologies for infectious diseases. Our system combines robust sample preparation with highly optimized and rapid isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology to enable rapid detection of infectious pathogens in a variety of unpurified patient sample types. The Talis One system is designed to have the following capabilities which we believe would create a competitive advantage over other commercially available point-of-care technologies:
 Highly accurate—The Talis One system incorporates a shelf-stable, single-use test cartridge that is designed to fully integrate a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) with sample preparation, including nucleic acid extraction and purification. Sample preparation is well known to be a critical factor to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, along with low limits of detection for target pathogens, in molecular diagnostics. We believe this sample preparation step, which is performed in an automated fashion on our cartridge, has the potential to result in higher sensitivity and specificity than point-of-care technologies that do not perform the sample preparation step. Our Talis One COVID-19 assay kit reaches limits of detection as low as 500 viral particles per milliliter. We can achieve similarly high performance on the Talis One system for bacteria with limits of detection of bacterial pathogens as low as one infectious unit per milliliter (IFU/mL) in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including nasal swab, vaginal swab, saliva and urine. 
 Rapid turnaround time—The Talis One system is designed to provide a positive or negative result in less than 30 minutes, depending upon the test and the concentration of the pathogen in the sample. We believe this turnaround time meets target customers’ needs for a system fast enough to fit into their clinical practice.
 Ease of use—We designed the Talis One system to be operated by untrained users and to function in a CLIA-waived environment such as physicians’ offices, urgent care clinics, elder care and assisted living facilities, cancer treatment and dialysis centers, and potentially in workplaces, schools and other facilities. The Talis One system is designed to be a fully integrated sample-to-answer system requiring two minutes or less of hands-on time by users running the test. The intuitive workflow of the Talis One system is also designed to facilitate the chain of custody of the sample without extensive tracking or handling by the user.
 Multiplex capability—The cartridge is designed to support up to 14 separate assay chambers, which we believe could potentially enable a full menu of detection modes, from single organism to syndromic panel tests. The test cartridge for our anticipated commercial launch offers five separate assay chambers.
 Cloud-enabled—Unlike other point-of-care instruments, the Talis One system incorporates a cellular modem within the instrument, which is designed to connect to the cloud to help customers manage clinical data and workflow. The cloud is designed to be remotely and securely accessed to obtain key data required to collect, screen, collate, report and monitor disease infection and pandemic spread on a micro and macro level. This could enable the creation of a public health interface and automatic transmission of “reportable infections,” such as COVID-19, to public health authorities in order to facilitate tracking of infectious diseases. The cloud capability is also designed to enable us to remotely manage instruments in the field, such as providing automated software updates and enable customers to track and manage instruments they have across their networks. For instances where cellular connectivity is unavailable or undesired, the instrument is designed to permit secure connectivity via ethernet. While we expect all instruments, if authorized for commercial sale, to be sold with cellular capability, the cloud database would not initially be available on devices distributed pursuant to our EUA, if obtained. This capability is expected to be enabled with an upcoming software upgrade in 2021 for all installed instruments.
 Scalable for different throughput requirements—The Talis One system was designed to provide a scalable platform for different volume and throughput requirements. The instruments are portable and designed for multi-instrument deployments to satisfy different testing volume requirements and to be stacked three instruments by three instruments without disturbing the cellular connection to the cloud.
 Low cost to manufacture—We designed the Talis One system to be low-cost and manufactured at scale. We believe this could facilitate scale-up in manufacturing and provide a competitive advantage in cost-sensitive environments. We believe this could also facilitate customers acquiring multiple Talis One instruments to meet their volume requirements.

If we receive an EUA from the FDA for our Talis One system and COVID-19 assay kit, we intend to commercialize the Talis One system in the United States through an enterprise account management team and direct sales force. If we increase adoption in the marketplace, we anticipate that this will establish a sales channel through which we can drive future sales of our test menu. Over time we intend to pursue commercialization strategies outside of the United States.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our strategy is to improve medical care through the transformation of diagnostic testing by enabling customers in distributed diagnostic locations to deploy accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing for infectious diseases and other conditions. To achieve this, we intend to:
 Pursue marketing authorization and commercialization of our COVID-19 assay kit in the United States
  
• | We are currently planning to seek an EUA for our COVID-19 test using our Talis One system in both laboratory and non-laboratory settings, for which we plan to submit in early Q2 2021.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If we receive an EUA, we intend to commercialize the Talis One system through an enterprise account management team and a direct sales force focused initially on placing systems with potential customers that place high value on accuracy, and our broader test menu in development. Target customer segments include (but are not limited to): (1) large elder care chains where vulnerable residents have unmet needs for millions of high sensitivity assays per year; (2) urgent care chains that serve on the front lines of COVID-19 diagnosis, needing millions of rapid tests to triage symptomatic patients; and (3) traditional medical establishments, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, cancer treatment and dialysis centers, independent practice associations, accountable care organizations, and public health clinics that that need rapid and high-quality testing to best serve their patients.

 Increase our low-cost manufacturing capacity for our Talis One instrument and COVID-19 test cartridges
  
• | We have ordered 5,000 instruments from our instrument contract manufacturing partners to be delivered through the third quarter of 2021.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines that are scheduled to reach capacity of approximately one million tests per month in the second half of 2021 and we intend to invest in further scale-up in 2021.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As we improve and scale manufacturing and automation, we expect to drive substantial reductions of cost of goods for our tests.

 Complete development of and, if marketing authorizations are obtained, commercialize other tests for other respiratory infections, infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections in the United States
  
• | We are developing additional tests for respiratory infections, including influenza A and influenza B, with the intention to pursue marketing authorizations and to commercialize a respiratory panel with our COVID-19 test. We have initiated discussions with the FDA and leveraging feedback from the FDA we intend to pursue the EUA pathway for this test panel. The current established pathway for marketing of a flu test is through the 510(k) clearance pathway. The FDA’s marketing authorization requirements for the combination of an influenza A, influenza B and COVID-19 test will impact the timing to develop and commercialize this panel, if authorized.

• | We are also developing a full menu of tests for infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections. We are focusing initially on our test to detect chlamydia and gonorrhea (CT/NG), for which we plan to initiate a clinical study in the second half of 2021 to support a 510(k) submission in the first half of 2022. We are subsequently targeting other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as a panel for sexually transmitted inflection that would include CT/NG, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium, a panel for bacterial vaginosis (BV), a panel for urinary tract

infections (UTI), and single target tests for infectious agents such as Group B streptococcus, or herpes simplex virus (HSV). If we obtain marketing authorization from the FDA, we intend to focus our commercialization efforts both on existing customers that may value our broader test menu, as well as obstetricians and gynecologists, the most common purchasers of these tests. We believe that a rapid, affordable and accurate point-of-care platform would enable these physicians to better diagnose and treat patients, practice value-based care, and create revenue opportunities by testing in-house rather than sending out tests to centralized laboratories.

 Pursue marketing authorization and, if authorized, commercialize our products and expand our operations in selected geographies globally
  
• | If we receive marketing authorization in the United States for our CT/NG test, we intend to pursue authorization to affix a CE Mark to enable commercialization of our test in Europe as early as the end of 2022 or approximately six months after U.S. clearance, if received. We also anticipate that we will pursue marketing authorization to commercialize our CT/NG test in selected countries in Asia, following our expansion into Europe.

 Industry background
 Infectious disease remains among the top health problems facing populations around the world. While infectious disease is an enduring concern for public health, in 2020 the world has been challenged by the COVID-19 global pandemic. 
 While the current pandemic presents a large and acute need for testing for COVID-19, the mortality rate for all infectious disease in the United States ranged between 42 and 63 deaths per 100,000 population, accounting for 5.4% of overall mortality for the period of 1980-2014.
 The drawbacks of centralized laboratory testing
 The need to send samples to a central location for testing introduces delays in treatment or incentivizes prescribing treatment in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. The turnaround time for centralized lab tests is typically one to five days and can often be longer. Therefore, physicians are faced with one of two choices: either wait days for test results before initiating treatment and risk that an infected patient may continue to spread the infection and suffer increasingly negative health effects from delayed treatment, or treat empirically while the patient is in front of them. Smaller hospital and clinic laboratories, many in rural settings, may not have the testing volume to justify investing in high throughput molecular diagnostic instruments, requiring smaller hospitals to send out molecular testing to reference laboratories and wait for the results.
 We believe that immediate access to high-quality diagnostic test results will improve medical treatment of disease and avoid inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, which can amplify the growing problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In a 2016 study of 1,103 emergency room patients at St. John Hospital & Medical Center in Detroit, 440 patients who had a suspected chlamydia or gonorrhea infection were treated with antibiotics even though the vast majority, 323 patients (74%), ultimately tested negative for the infection. Similarly, in some cases, 
 7



test result delays lead to patients who do not return after the initial visit, resulting in the health care provider losing these patients to follow-up and unnecessarily exposing additional individuals to detectable and treatable infections. This is particularly problematic in pediatric care and for urgent care and community care clinics.
 Limitations of current point-of-care diagnostic technologies
 There are a broad range of point-of-care technologies available that are used in physician offices for a variety of applications, ranging from glucose strips for diabetes to lateral flow immunoassays for detecting high pathogen load infections, such as Strep A or influenza. Molecular testing is less common in point-of-care settings, despite being highly accurate. We believe that this is due to a lack of available point-of-care molecular technologies that sufficiently balance speed, accuracy and cost to meet customer needs and drive broad adoption.
 We believe that most molecular diagnostic solutions currently being marketed for use at the point-of-care each have one or more of the following limitations:
  
• | Low performance as measured by sensitivity, specificity and limit of detection can result in misdiagnosis and poor clinical outcomes. Several point-of-care molecular diagnostic platforms provide results in less than 30 minutes but achieve this speed by performing nucleic acid amplification on samples, foregoing sample preparation, which is known to limit the sensitivity, specificity and limit of detection of these nucleic acid tests. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Slow turnaround time can extend beyond the time a patient will wait for results and potentially result in loss of patient to follow-up. Other available point-of-care systems may provide reliable, high performance results, but these tests can take 45 to 90 minutes to return a result. While results returned within hours is better than days, we believe that the longer a test takes, the less willing patients will be to wait at the clinical site for results, thereby risking patients failing to return after the initial visit and unnecessarily exposing additional individuals to a detectable infectious agent. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Platforms that can require significant user interaction or monitoring will not work well with clinical workflow. Some platforms sold as point-of-care solutions require users to transfer solutions midway through a run or handle the instrument, test cartridge and/or sample multiple times in order to process one test. The typical physician’s office does not have laboratory personnel that can monitor an instrument, nor personnel trained in sample custody tracking. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Platforms that are difficult to manufacture at low cost or at scale can limit adoption. We believe that the cost of purchasing and using diagnostic testing platforms and consumables is a primary concern for customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited test menus fail to meet the needs of clinicians. The adoption of diagnostic technologies is contingent upon the technology having both clinical utility as well as economic rationale. Without a broad and relevant testing menu, testing platforms may not sufficiently meet the clinical needs of customers to justify the expense. We believe the ability to develop our planned additional assays will create a competitive barrier to entry for other platforms.

The Talis One system
 We are developing the Talis One system to address limitations of existing point-of-care diagnostic testing technologies for infectious diseases. Our system combines robust sample preparation with highly-optimized and rapid isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology to enable rapid detection of infectious pathogens in a variety of unpurified patient sample types. The Talis One system is an integrated system that includes a compact instrument, single-use test cartridges and software, including a central cloud database.
Talis One cartridge
 At the core of our system is the Talis One cartridge, a versatile shelf-stable and single-use test cartridge that is designed to fully integrate proprietary highly-optimized nucleic acid isothermal amplification assays with sample preparation. The cartridge is designed to handle a wide range of sample types, including nasal swab, vaginal swab, saliva, urine, whole blood, plasma, serum and sputum, to be compatible with lysis by bead-beating in order to 
 8



process a wide range of pathogens, including viral, bacterial and hard-to-lyse fungal pathogens. The cartridge design incorporates a patented rotary valve that integrates sample purification and is easily adaptable to alternate fluidic layouts to accommodate alternate testing methods that may require pre-treatment of specimens, pre-amplification and/or multiple purification steps to facilitate expansion of the testing menu. The cartridge also incorporates a reagent plug technology licensed from a contract manufacturing partner, which is designed to enable implementation of new tests on the same cartridge backbone simply by inserting plugs with different target assay reagents. The reagent plugs in our cartridges are optically clear, permitting the instrument to visualize and detect fluorescent signals from the amplification assay. Patented assay wells employ a fluidic design and include a mechanism to heat-seal the cartridge for amplicon containment designed to prevent contamination of the work surfaces.
 The cartridge is designed to support up to 14-well multiplexing, which we believe will enable development of expanded panels and syndromic applications. The specific cartridge that we are developing for the COVID-19 and CT/NG tests provides 5-fold multiplexing, which we believe is sufficient to meet our near-term product plans.
 Talis One instrument
 The Talis One instrument is designed to enable sample-to-answer capabilities without user intervention. We designed the instrument to be low cost, portable and easy to use. We believe the modular design, which is divided into major subsystems for performing cartridge handling, sample preparation, amplification and detection, will facilitate automated assembly and low-cost manufacturing. The compact size, approximately 7 x 10 x 14 inches, is designed to enable portability and use in various front-line locations. The instrument incorporates a touchpad interface for easily communicating instructions, information and results to the user. An integrated camera that reads and enables registration of a label on the cartridge, facilitates sample custody by linking an image of the cartridge label with test results. The instruments are designed for multi-instrument deployments to satisfy different testing volume requirements and can be stacked three instruments by three instruments without disturbing the cellular connection to the cloud.
 Talis One software and IT
 The Talis One system incorporates software and information technology (IT) capabilities. The instrument is designed to communicate test results to a central cloud database that can be remotely and securely accessed to obtain key data required to collect, screen, collate, report, and monitor disease infection and pandemic spread on a micro and macro level. The cellular and ethernet connectivity built into each Talis One instrument is also designed to enable Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant transmission, storage, and review, and we expect to make such features available with a planned post-launch software upgrade. Such centralized storage could permit (i) creation of a public health interface granting access to select information to governmental entities and/or (ii) automatic transmission of “reportable infections” to public health authorities. The cloud-based data could serve to help institutions better manage clinical practice and also to improve infection control. With substantially increased adoption over time, the data may offer a mapping of infection patterns that can be used by public health and research institutions to address care on a larger scale. Additionally, for organizations that may desire multiple instrument placements, such as in multiple exam rooms, multiple departments or distributed testing sites, authorized administrators may be able to monitor, in real-time, the status of any instrument in the organization, as well as manage users, passwords, and certain security features. The continuous connectivity of the Talis One instruments is also designed to enable us to provide automated updates including security patches, instrument configurations, and firmware and software updates, the latter of which could be deployed to enable the instrument to recognize and run newly released tests.
 Talis One workflow
 The Talis One system is capable of being integrated into the clinical workflow as follows: (1) label cartridge with patient information, (2) dispense sample into loading port and close lid, (3) insert cartridge into instrument, and (4) follow on-instrument instructions to initiate testing, results will automatically display after less than 30 minutes. The workflow may vary for alternate sample types.
 9



The Talis One workflow follows a few simple steps from sample preparation to results. The system is designed to return results in less than 30 minutes and requires two minutes or less of hands-on time for the operator. After the sample is collected and the cartridge is introduced into the instrument, the instrument confirms the operability of the cartridge, runs the assay and communicates the test result to the instrument display. We believe the ease of use, compact size and speed could enable near-patient diagnosis in a broad range of settings.
 Talis One assay kits
 We are a development stage company and, to date, we have not generated revenue from product sales. As reflected in the table below, we are developing Talis One assay kits for respiratory infections, infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections. We anticipate that our first test to be marketed focuses on detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. We are also developing additional tests for the detection of other respiratory infections, such as a respiratory panel test to detect influenza A and influenza B plus SARS-CoV-2. We intend to submit for a 510(k) clearance to commercialize our Talis One system with a test for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in the first half of 2022. For other tests that are not eligible for an EUA, we intend to complete the requirements for and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA (if available to us; otherwise we would plan to submit another form of marketing authorization under the FDA’s standard medical device authorities). We chose our assay development roadmap to address the most common clinically relevant tests which require high sensitivity and specificity and for which timely results provide significant clinical benefit. In addition to the project previously described, our women’s and sexual health roadmap includes plans to develop seek marketing authorization for (1) a STI panel including CT, NG, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium; (2) an assay for herpes simplex virus; (3) a multitarget panel assay for UTI; (4) a multitarget panel assay for BV; and (5) a single target assay for Group B streptococcus.
 Respiratory infections
 The Talis One COVID-19 assay kit
 The Talis One COVID-19 assay kit is our first product in development for respiratory infections. The test cartridge for COVID-19 diagnosis contains a NAAT designed for optimal sensitivity and specificity to provide highly accurate results. The assay on the Talis One cartridge is an isothermal NAAT targeting two physically separated locations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to increase sensitivity and inclusivity. The inclusion of two distinct targets reduces the likelihood that natural mutations in the virus would cause a false negative result when using the Talis One COVID-19 assay kit. We submitted a request for an EUA to the FDA for our Talis One COVID-19 assay kit in CLIA-moderate settings in January 2021. In late February 2021, the FDA informed us that it cannot ensure the comparator assay used in the primary study has sufficient sensitivity to support our EUA application. On March 8, 2021, we announced that we withdrew our January application in favor of focusing on an application to authorize testing at the point-of-care. An EUA would allow us to market and sell our Talis One system and COVID-19 assay kit without 510(k) clearance or any other marketing authorization. The duration of any EUA we may receive is uncertain as the FDA may revoke an EUA when it determines the health emergency is over or no longer warrants such authorization or if we fail to comply with the conditions of the EUA. After the emergency period is declared to be over, we expect that the FDA will require companies operating under an EUA to submit a 510(k) pre-market notification for tests such as our COVID-19 assay kit, but we believe the FDA will provide a grace period for such submissions. Accordingly, we intend to complete the requirements for and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA for our Talis One system and COVID-19 assay kit to enable continued marketing when the public health emergency period is declared to be over.
 Respiratory panels
 We also anticipate developing respiratory panels incorporating our COVID-19 test. We are developing tests targeting influenza A and influenza B. If we successfully commercialize the Talis One system for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we plan to incorporate these flu tests with the COVID-19 test in an upper respiratory panel on a single cartridge and seeking marketing authorizations for such multi-panel tests, whether through the EUA process, if available to us, or through a 510(k) clearance process once available to us.

Infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections
 We are also developing our Talis One system to be used for infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections. We intend to complete clinical development of our Talis One system for CT/NG and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA in the first half of 2022. We further intend to pursue authorization to affix a CE Mark from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by the end of 2022 or approximately six months after 510(k) clearance, if obtained. If cleared or otherwise authorized for marketing, this would be our first commercial offering in our women’s health menu. We are planning to develop additional tests for infections related to women’s health, including a panel for STIs and other infections, such as BV, UTI and HSV.
 The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends annual CT/NG screening of all sexually active women age 25 and younger and for women over age 25 with risk factors. In addition to promoting our test menu to our existing customers we will engage in a focused commercialization effort directed towards obstetricians and gynecologists where we estimate that a substantial majority of CT/NG testing occurs. Traditionally, testing is carried out by centralized laboratories and we believe that there is a significant opportunity to move these tests to the point-of-care at the office of the obstetrician and gynecologist or in urgent care clinics or primary care facilities. We believe testing at the point-of-care and could improve decision making and enable the provider to use this information to treat the patient in the same visit. We believe this could improve the patient experience and empower providers and patients to adhere to screening guidelines and improve outcomes. We also believe that care providers may be able to create profit opportunities by bringing testing in-house to the point-of-care. We believe the tests that we are developing for our Talis One system have established reimbursement codes, enabling healthcare providers to submit for reimbursement.
 Future applications
 We are developing new algorithms and a bioinformatics pipeline to design rapid isothermal assays that are based on isothermal amplification chemistries. On the Talis One system, we have observed limits of detection of bacterial pathogens as low as one IFU/mL in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including nasal swab, vaginal swab, saliva and urine. We have also demonstrated, in a research setting, rapid detection of similarly low concentrations for a variety of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral pathogens.
 Commercialization
 We are currently developing the Talis One assay kit for COVID-19, other respiratory infections, and infections related to women’s health and STIs. We estimate that the total potential annualized addressable market opportunity for COVID-19 tests in the United States exceeds $7.0 billion and exceeds $5.0 billion for our Talis One assay kits in development for infections related to women’s health and STIs and our COVID-Flu Panel.
We believe that the demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testing will evolve over three phases as the pandemic progresses:
 Initial phase:    We believe 2020 epitomized the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by diagnostic testing predominantly of individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare providers in high-volume centralized locations. In this initial phase, there was insufficient supply of tests to meet the demand and was primarily carried out through the use of centralized laboratories or rapid antigen tests with limited amount of point-of-care molecular testing. While the testing capacity using currently authorized options may ultimately surpass the daily testing need, we believe these current tests lack the capabilities to meet the testing needs as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, most importantly due to limitations providing highly accurate and actionable diagnosis in a timely manner. We believe that the preferred approach for COVID-19 diagnostic testing will be to deliver the highest testing accuracy and results in a timely manner, which we believe can only be met by a point-of-care, molecular-based approach.
 Second phase:    We believe that the demand for products such as the Talis One COVID-19 assay kit will grow from the initial phase because vaccination will become more common and point-of-care testing will become increasingly available. As a result, testing will shift from high-volume centralized sites to the point-of-care. Included in the broader group of potential customers that will adopt point-of-care diagnostic technologies will be physicians’ offices, institutions caring for vulnerable populations, urgent care centers, employers, and schools. We expect that this will drive a shift of testing towards the point-of-care and 
 11



significant demand for point-of-care technologies, with a high importance by customers placed on accuracy and speed.
 Third phase:    We believe that an additional phase of the COVID-19 pandemic may emerge and which could extend into the foreseeable future. In this phase, the presence of vaccines is expected to result in a lower incidence of COVID-19. However, we believe that there will continue to be a high focus on safety supporting demand for COVID-19 testing, especially as it relates to demand from potential customers testing individuals suspected of COVID-19 infection and of vulnerable populations. Additionally, there may be demand for rapid point-of-care testing as a means to determine eligibility for COVID-19 therapies that may be shown to be effective only in a narrow timeframe after initial exposure or onset of symptoms, and this could particularly apply to people who were not vaccinated or had an insufficient or waning vaccine response. We anticipate that this phase will drive demand for panel-based tests which incorporate additional respiratory viruses, for example a flu and COVID-19 panel. Respiratory infections, including COVID-19, can be difficult to diagnose and having a panel-based test to diagnose for and rule-out different pathogens can improve the chances of a definitive diagnosis on the first test.
 Subject to receipt of marketing authorization for our COVID-19 assay kits using our Talis One system, our initial sales strategy will focus on increasing adoption of the Talis One system in two customer types: enterprise accounts and health care providers. We initially plan to launch the Talis One system through an enterprise account management team and a direct sales force with approximately 40 sales representatives dedicated to increasing adoption in both categories. With respect to direct sales, we intend to commercialize the Talis One system through a sales force focused initially on placing system with potential customers that place high value on accuracy and/or our broader test menu in development. Target customer segments include: (1) large elder care chains where vulnerable residents have unmet needs for millions of high sensitivity assays per year; (2) urgent care chains that serve on the front lines of COVID-19 diagnosis, needing millions of rapid tests to triage symptomatic patients; and (3) traditional medical establishments, including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, cancer treatment and dialysis centers, independent practice associations, accountable care organizations and public health clinics that need rapid and high-quality testing to best serve their patients. These customers represent large and concentrated testing opportunities for COVID-19. For example, we estimate that a single large elder care chain could represent a COVID-19 testing opportunity of over a million tests per year. In addition, the sales team will directly target smaller accounts including obstetrician and gynecologist practices, primary care doctors and mid-sized physician networks. We may also consider sales to organizations such as schools and school districts as well as corporate customers.
 We intend to offer our Talis One system to customers via direct purchase of the instrument or through a reagent rental program. Under these options we expect to generate revenue in the form of instrument sales or rentals, test cartridge sales, instrument warranty payments, and test collection device revenue.
 We designed our system for the institutional healthcare provider category, particularly those that serve populations who are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. We believe that this market category could be a significant driver of our growth both near and longer-term due to the many types and significant number of potential institutional healthcare providers. Institutional healthcare providers typically represent sizeable patient populations, allowing a relatively large number of patients to be targeted with a limited number of account managers. Although institutional healthcare providers may require a sales cycle lasting several weeks or months, fixed-price arrangements from certain of these customers may provide us with a steady and predictable revenue stream.
 While institutional healthcare providers are an important selling focus initially, we believe establishment of a direct sales force will enhance our growth, increase the number of institutional referrals, and expand the footprint of our brand within the U.S. market.
 Competition
 The in vitro diagnostics industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary intellectual property. Due to the significant interest and growth in diagnostics, we expect ongoing intense competition. However, we believe our proprietary and adaptable technology platform, our process capabilities and our manufacturing scale will distinguish us from our competitors.
 12



We anticipate facing competition primarily from centralized laboratories and diagnostic companies offering both point-of-care and at-home solutions. Competitors include those offering molecular, antibody and antigen tests. Competitors in the reference lab category include Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (commonly referred to as LabCorp) and Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, along with many hospital laboratories. Competitors with point-of-care molecular diagnostic technology platforms that are either currently available or that are in development include Abbott Laboratories, Binx Health, Inc., BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Cepheid (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Cue Health Inc., Lucira Health, Inc., Mesa Biotech, Inc. (recently acquired by Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.), Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., and Visby Medical, Inc.
 Each of the preceding companies have received an EUA for a point-of-care COVID-19 test. There are also smaller or earlier-stage companies developing tests that may also prove to be significant competitors, in the COVID-19 market or in the women’s health and/or sexual health markets. Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, regulatory clearance approval and compliance, and sales and distribution than we do. Mergers and acquisitions involving diagnostics companies may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies or customer networks. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize diagnostic products or services that are more accurate, more convenient to use or more cost-effective than our products or services. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain clearance or approval or other marketing authorizations for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter a particular market.
 We believe key competitive factors impacting our success include the accuracy, utility, turnaround time and economics of our products, and commercial execution. We also believe our success in the future depends on the timing of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals, as well as the timing of our ability to deliver instruments and consumables into the marketplace in significant volumes.
 Government Contract
 National Institutes of Health - Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx)
 In July 2020, we were awarded a $25.4 million contract from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Phase 2 of its RADx initiative (NIH Contract), of which $8.9 million had been received as of December 31, 2020, for the validation, approval, and scale-up of capacity for manufacturing of the Talis One instrument and test cartridges. Pursuant to the NIH Contract, we are required to obtain and maintain an EUA from the FDA for the Talis One system and COVID-19 assay kit. We are also required to provide data and reports to and meet regularly with NIH for evaluation of milestones and compliance with contractual obligations. Prices offered to consumers must ultimately be a fair market rate and consistent with the objective of increasing and improving testing in the US. Further, the testing capabilities produced are for utilization within the U.S. and its territories.
 
The term of the NIH Contract is one year. The NIH Contract can be terminated for convenience by the NIH at any time, or for cause upon a failure to perform the services as specified in the NIH Contract. In the latter circumstance, we would be required to repay the NIH 15.0% of the amounts already paid to us under the NIH Contract as liquidated damages, in place of any actual damages. Such repayment would not be required if a delay in delivery or performance was beyond our control and without fault or negligence on our part.
 Operations
 Manufacturing process
 Our products are manufactured by several third parties, including a single contract manufacturer that provisions the parts and assembles our instrument. The instrument assembly is largely manual with some automation in testing. Our instrument contract manufacturer is scaling up to be able to make up to 500 instruments per week. We have various suppliers that provide molded parts and reagents that are assembled by two contract manufacturers 
 13



for the cartridge. We are investing approximately $119.8 million dollars to scale up cartridge manufacturing. This investment includes high cavity count molding capability and automation of significant portions of the cartridge assembly process. Our operations consist of demand forecast planning, raw material procurement, and quality oversight. The operations team is responsible for ensuring adherence to our Quality Management System to meet or exceed applicable standards to support manufacturing, testing and distribution of our products.
 Supply chain management
 We utilize industry-leading vendors for our supply chain. Currently, many of the materials, enzymes and reagents used in our systems and cartridges are from single source suppliers. However, we are evaluating redundancy vendors for reagents and other materials where possible. To further mitigate risk, we are implementing multi-month, multi-lot safety stock strategy to promote an uninterrupted supply of critical or scarce reagents and other materials. Initially we plan to source many of the test cartridge materials and provide them to our contract manufacturers. Over time, we plan to transfer acquisition of these materials to our contract manufacturing partners. We plan to engage a third-party logistics company to manage the movement of materials between suppliers and for finished goods warehousing.
 Supply Agreement with thinXXS Microtechnology AG (thinXXS)
 In May 2020, we entered into a supply agreement with thinXXS (thinXXS Agreement), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDEX Corporation (NYSE:IEX), for the purchase of certain materials, including single-use cartridges for use with the Talis One system and components and subassemblies of such single-use cartridges. Pursuant to the thinXXS Agreement, we are required to submit an annual forecast of expected purchase volumes with portions of such annual forecast constituting a binding commitment based on certain percentages set forth in the thinXXS Agreement. We are also required to submit non-binding rolling forecasts to thinXXS. The prices we pay were initially fixed upon execution of the thinXXS Agreement and may not be increased until a specified date. Following such specified date, the purchase prices will be negotiated by the parties. Additionally, subject to certain criteria, thinXXS has the right to be our exclusive supplier of the cartridges, up to a specified annual volume.
 The initial term of the thinXXS Agreement is 10 years, after which the thinXXS Agreement will remain in effect unless we provide two years’ prior written notice of non-renewal. The thinXXS Agreement can also be terminated (i) after May 2027, by us for convenience, upon two years’ prior written notice, (ii) subject to certain conditions, by either party upon 90 days’ prior written notice of an uncured material breach of the thinXXS Agreement, and (iii) by either party upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
 
Intellectual property
 Patents
 Our intellectual property strategy is focused on protecting our core technologies, including target-specific amplification reagents, integrated cartridges and components thereof, and related instrumentation and software applications through patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, we protect our ongoing research and development into the detection of infectious diseases through patents and other intellectual property rights in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, such as Japan, China, the United Kingdom and the European Union (through shared registration or examination agencies such as the European Patent Office or European Intellectual Property Office). As of January 1, 2021, we solely own nine issued U.S. patents, 18 pending U.S. patent applications, 12 issued foreign patents, 59 pending foreign patent applications, and three pending PCT international patent applications. We co-own three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and 11 pending foreign patent applications with Caltech. We exclusively in-license 10 issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, 17 issued foreign patents and four pending foreign patent applications from the University of Chicago and/or Caltech. We believe that the technology we have in-licensed from the University of Chicago and Caltech, respectively, has no impact on our competitive position in our industry. Our patent portfolio generally includes patents and patent applications relating microfluidic systems, our rapid isothermal amplification method, integrated cartridges and instrument for the Talis One system, as well as components thereof and methods of operating the same. In addition to patents and applications related generally to the Talis One system, our portfolio includes patents and applications drawn to assay reagents for specific targets, including SARS-CoV-2 (the causative pathogen for 
 14



COVID-19), Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Issued U.S. patents in our portfolio of company-owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications (if issued) are expected to expire between 2030 and 2040.
 Trademarks
 Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands of our current and future products and includes U.S. trademark applications for registration for our company name, Talis, and the product name Talis One. Our trademark applications may not proceed to registration, and our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For instance, we are currently subject to ongoing opposition before the United States Patent and Trademark Office filed by Talis Clinical, LLC, which alleges that our application for registration of the trademark TALIS should not be registered because it is likely to be confused with the prior unregistered trademark TALIS used in connection medical software and related goods and services. In the event this opposition is successful, or if we enter into a settlement agreement with Talis Clinical, LLC, we could lose rights to this trademark. We cannot predict the outcome of this action or if we will be subject to similar claims in the future.
 Trade secrets
 We also rely on trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as aspects of our amplification chemistry, some bioinformatics, data processing and analysis techniques, and manufacturing processes are better kept as trade secrets, rather than pursuing patent protection. To prevent disclosure of trade secrets to others, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure, invention assignment and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or determine the likelihood that these efforts will provide any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or technology. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Furthermore, it may be difficult to protect our trade secrets. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, they may be inadequate and can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for violations of such measures. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding risks related to intellectual property, please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
 Government regulation and product approval
 Our products under development and our operations are subject to significant government regulation. In the United States, our products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities.
 FDA regulation of medical devices
 The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices:
  
• | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical trials;
--+-----------------

 15



 
• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | pre-market clearance and approval;
--+-----------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market approval studies; and
--+----------------------------------


• | product import and export.
--+---------------------------

 In the United States, numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed. These include the FDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations, among others.
 FDA pre-market clearance and approval requirements
 Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or approval of a pre-market approval (PMA) application, from the FDA, unless specifically exempted. In addition, devices may receive EUAs, such as those issued for in vitro diagnostics to detect SARS-CoV-2, which are time-limited authorizations under the public health emergency provisions of the FDCA.
 The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and additional conditions set forth in FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) pre-market notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified but are subject to the FDA’s pre-market notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
 In addition, EUAs and other forms of approval or clearance may be limited to use of tests by authorized laboratories certified under CLIA to perform moderate and high-complexity tests. In order for a test to be used at the point-of-care, the FDA must grant the test waived status under CLIA, which would permit any laboratory with a Certificate of Waiver to perform the test.
 Emergency Use Authorization
 Section 564 of the FDCA authorizes the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare public health emergencies that have a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens. Before an EUA may be issued, the Secretary must declare an emergency based on one of the following grounds:
 16



 
• | a determination by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security that there is a domestic emergency, or a significant potential for a domestic emergency, involving a heightened risk of attack with a specified biological, chemical, radiological or nuclear agent or agents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the Secretary of the Department of Defense that there is a military emergency, or a significant potential for a military emergency, involving a heightened risk to U.S. military forces of attack with a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the Secretary of the HHS of a public health emergency that effects or has the significant potential to affect, national security, and that involves a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, or a specified disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent or agents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior such public health emergencies have included declarations regarding the Zika virus (2016), Ebola virus (2014), and Avian flu virus (2013). On February 4, 2020, the novel coronavirus was declared a public health emergency, and it was declared that circumstances existed justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. These EUAs will terminate upon declaration that the public health emergency circumstances have ceased, or the product provided pursuant to EUA has otherwise achieved commercial authorization for the emergency indication for use, such as through 510(k) clearance or PMA approval.
 In order to be the subject of an EUA, the FDA Commissioner (under authority delegated by the Secretary of the HHS) must conclude that, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing a disease attributable to the agents described above, that its known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks, and that there is no adequate, approved and available alternative. The applicant’s request for an EUA includes available scientific evidence, and the FDA engages in interactive review of the request with the applicant. If and once authorized, products subject to an EUA must comply with the conditions of an EUA, including informing healthcare professionals and patients of the risks and benefits of the product, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping, and may include distribution and advertising controls and limitations. The FDA may revise or revoke an EUA to protect the public health.
 510(k) clearance process
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMA applications, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Once a de novo application is reviewed and approved, it results in the device having a Class II status and future devices from the company or a competitor may use the company’s de novo-classified device as a 510(k) predicate.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or 
 17



recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties.
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the pre-market notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. The FDA also announced that it intends to finalize guidance to establish a pre-market review pathway for “manufacturers of certain well-understood device types” as an alternative to the 510(k) clearance pathway and that such pre-market review pathway would allow manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process.
 In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on its plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates, including whether the FDA should publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. The FDA requested public feedback on whether it should consider certain actions that might require new authority, such as whether to sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized the aforementioned guidance to describe an optional “safety and performance based” pre-market review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway, by demonstrating that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA intends to maintain a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based pathway” and develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
 De novo classification process
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
 18



Pre-market approval process
 A PMA application must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre- amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, preclinical, and clinical trials, as well as manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
 Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process.
 The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 Clinical trials
 A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements.
 In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 19



During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
 Pervasive and continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulation
 After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
  
• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;

 International regulation
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly.
 Other healthcare laws
 Our current and future business activities are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the civil False Claims Act (FCA), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment or approval by the federal government, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Additionally, the FCA authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of life sciences companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is 
 21



expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the AKS, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Moreover, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiology assistants, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act includes in its reporting requirements a broad range of transfers of value including, but not limited to, consulting fees, speaker honoraria, charitable contributions, research payments and grants. Failure to report could subject companies to significant financial penalties. Tracking and reporting the required payments and transfers of value may result in considerable expense and additional resources. Several states currently have similar laws and more states may enact similar legislation, some of which may be broader in scope. For example, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, implementation of gift bans and spending limits, and/or reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our future operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, additional reporting and oversight requirements, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 Hospitals, clinical laboratories and other healthcare provider customers that may purchase our product candidates, if approved, generally bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees 
 22



associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our product candidates. If our product candidates are cleared or approved by the FDA as point-of-care tests and deemed CLIA-waived following market authorization, we expect that the majority of our diagnostic tests will be performed in physician offices and other point-of-care settings and billed using existing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Our healthcare provider customers may not purchase our tests unless third-party payors cover and provide adequate reimbursement for a substantial portion of the price of the tests. If we are not able to obtain coverage and an acceptable level of reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors, there would typically be a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient for whom the test is ordered or the patient may be forced to pay the entire cost of the test out-of-pocket, which could dissuade practitioners from ordering our tests and, if ordered, could result in a delay in or decreased likelihood of collecting payment, whether from patients or from third-party payors. Our customers’ access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and/or product candidates by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.
 The potential end-users of our Talis One system and diagnostic tests include large elder care chains where vulnerable residents have unmet needs for millions of high sensitivity assays per year; urgent care chains that serve on the front lines of COVID-19 diagnosis, needing millions of rapid tests to triage symptomatic patients; and traditional medical establishments including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, cancer treatment and dialysis centers, independent practice associations, accountable care organizations, and public health clinics that need rapid and high-quality testing to best serve their patients.
 Hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers who purchase diagnostic products in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, such as private health insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product. Therefore, our market success is highly dependent upon government and commercial third-party payors providing coverage and adequate reimbursement for our test. While we believe our COVID-19 test will qualify for coverage that is currently available for other COVID-19 tests on the market, coverage criteria and reimbursement rates for diagnostic tests are subject to adjustment by payors, and current reimbursement rates could be reduced, or coverage criteria restricted in the future, which could adversely affect the market for our tests.
 There has been federal and state legislation and other reform initiatives regarding the coverage and reimbursement for COVID-19 diagnostic testing in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) generally requires group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance to cover FDA approved COVID-19 tests and associated diagnostic costs with no cost-sharing, as long as the test is deemed medically appropriate and furnished on or after March 18, 2020 and during the applicable public health emergency period. The FFCRA also permits states to cover testing for the uninsured through Medicaid with federal financing. Additionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act expanded the FFCRA to include a broader range of diagnostic tests and services as well as requiring plans and issuers to cover out-of-network COVID-19 test claims at up to the cash price that the provider has posted on a public website.
 CMS announced plans in March 2020 to cover the cost of COVID-19 diagnostic testing under the Medicare program and identified the amount at which it would reimburse for such tests, which has been adjusted numerous times. For example, Medicare adjusted its payment methodology effective January 1, 2021, such that it will pay $100 per test only to those laboratories that complete high throughput COVID-19 diagnostic tests within two calendar days of the specimen being collected and will only pay $75 per test to laboratories that take longer than two days to complete such test. This change is indicative of the evolving nature of the coverage and reimbursement of COVID-19 tests.
 Healthcare reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking, among other things, to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to directly commercialize our products.
 23



By way of example, in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) which was signed into law in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the ACA:
  
• | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been executive, judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas (Texas District Court Judge), ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when or how the Supreme Court will rule. Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is also unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. For example, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Data privacy and security
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, processing, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder, imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business 
 24



associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI), a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties.
 Further, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented similar privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information. These laws and regulations are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective, we may have to comply with the stricter provisions. In addition to fines and penalties imposed upon violators, some of these state laws also may afford a private right of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients, and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as PHI or personally identifiable information along with increased demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our costs of providing our services, decrease demand for our services, reduce our revenue and/or subject us to additional risks.
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
 In addition, certain state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) may govern the privacy and security of health and other types of personal information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. 
 In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018 and introduced strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, the GDPR generally prohibits the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States many other countries unless the parties to the transfer have established a legal basis for the transfer and implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Additionally, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and the 
 25



EEA, companies have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.
