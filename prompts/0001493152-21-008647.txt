Item 1. Business.
General
 
The Company designs and distributes pickup truck covers called tonneau covers throughout the United States and Canada. Tonneau covers, described below are useful aftermarket accessories that provide security and protection for cargo to personal pickup truck owners.
 
The public, company, Franchise Holdings International, Inc. (“FNHI”), was incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 2, 2003.
 
Worksport Ltd. was formed in 2011 in Ontario, Canada (“Worksport Ontario”).
 
In December 2014, FNHI acquired 100% of the outstanding equity of Worksport Ontario pursuant to which Worksport Ontario became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FNHI. Since acquiring Worksport Ontario, the Company has abandoned all previous business plans and has focused on developing the tonneau business.
 
In May 2020, FNHI changed its name to Worksport Ltd. The Company’s common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol “WKSP.” All references to “Worksport,” “WKSP,” or “the Company” as used herein refers to the consolidated operations of the Company and Worksport Ontario.
 
Products
 
We have developed soft vinyl tonneau covers and hard aluminum tonneau covers. Covers are offered in three or four-panel options. Once installed, our tonneau covers latch against the bed of the truck and fold up against the back window of the truck cab.
 
Our current products include the SC (Soft Cover) SC3, SC3pro and TC (Tough Cover) TC3 lines.
 
SC3
 
The SC3 was Worksport’s first product introduced in 2011 and is fitted with a powder coated lightweight aluminum frame and rear cam latches. The tri-fold cover is ultra-violet (UV) protected vinyl tri-layer material that seals around the truck bed with a rubber gasket designed to protect cargo from moisture and debris.

SC3pro
 
The SC3pro was introduced in 2012 and has been upgraded from the SC3 to include our patented “Smart Latch” system. The SC3pro offers the same features as the SC3; however, the Smart Latch system allows the operator to open the cover by simply pulling a release cable.
 
TC3
 
The TC3 was introduced in 2011 but offers a 14 millimeter thick aluminum tri-cover panel with a honey-comb core coated in a durable black scratch-resistant powder coating. The TC3 is fitted with the same frame as the SC3 and seals and latches the same as the SC3.
 
Products in Production
 
Worksport is currently developing the following products:
 
SC4
 
The SC4 is estimated to launch in the third quarter of 2021. We believe that this will be the first vinyl wrapped tonneau cover to fold in four sections. This cover will also allow its users full bed access by being foldable upwards toward the rear window of the truck. This cover will be more compact when folded parallel to the back window of the truck which will reduce wind resistance and rear window obstruction.
 
TC4
 
The TC4 is currently in the design stage with an estimated to launch in the third quarter of 2021. The TC4 design will fold with four sections, and rotate toward the truck cab’s rear window, allowing full bed access. The cover will have three locking points, with two latching points that are cable operated. The cover will be made using FRP (fiberglass reinforced polymer) panels with a matte black silicate surface, for a durable, matt-black finish.
 
Like the SC3pro, TC4 will offer cable operated latching system. Options on the TC4 will include expandable cargo division and storage solutions.

TERRAVIS
 
We are currently developing a two component system called the TerraVis that consists of a solar tonneau cover and portable core battery.
 
The TerraVis tonneau cover will be the charging component of the TerraVis and is part of a larger proprietary system which uses mono-crystalline high efficiency solar panels, rather than our standard FRP or Aluminum rigid panels. The system will generate up to 1000-watts of low voltage DC current. The power will then be stored in an integrated, scalable Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFeP04) battery bank, that can expand to over 6 kilowatts (kw) of energy storage. These components all combine to form the property TerraVis System, referenced above. The energy can be stored and inverted to two 2000-watt 110V AC outlets or used to re-charge the vehicle’s onboard battery systems as emergency.
 
Based on our TC4 design, our TerraVis cover is designed to provide portable power for pickup trucks and add driving range to next-generation EV (Electric Vehicle) pickups by generating solar charge power. While folded over the bed of the truck, the TerraVis cover is designed to charge power banks and portable batteries, turning any truck into a mobile micro-grid power station.
 

TerraVis will be designed with integrated track systems within the bed of the truck. These tracks can be used for a variety of add-on options such as, chrome trim, tie downs, cargo cleats, textile storage bags, seating, cargo racks, sliding system and others.
 
The TerraVis COR will be the battery component of TerraVis and will be available to the broader consumer market as a standalone mobile power system for off-grid power. This will be a modular, scalable, portable power system. Chargeable via the TerraVis solar panel tonneau cover, any solar panel, or wall outlet. the TerraVis COR is the battery pack that will produce power from the modular Worksport COR battery packs and provide DC powder to charge mobile devices, as well as invert the power to 2000 watts of A/C power to power job sites, camp sites, or where power may not be conveniently available.
 
Our sales efforts for our TerraVis System will be focused on the North American markets, for companies such as Rivian, Workhorse, Atlis, Bollinger, Tesla, Hercules, as well as GM and Ford trucks.
 
Manufacturing
 
All Worksport products are manufactured in a facility located Meizhou, China according to our specifications, schematics and blueprints. We believe that production at the factory can be increased within 30 days to facilitate volumes up to 10 times the current output without any adverse effects on quality or craftsmanship.

We are currently in the process of establishing manufacturing presence within North America (the United States, Canada and Mexico). Management is hopeful that an agreement can be reached between respective governments and that a new facility can be built sometime in 2021. Management believes that having manufacturing capability in North America will increase quality control and production efficiency.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its parts and accessories, and services. This includes patents, trademarks, service marks, and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.
Patents
 
Our current intellectual portfolio consists of: four (4) issued U.S. utility and divisional patents, four (4) completed international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patents, one (1) issued Canadian utility and pending divisional patent. We also in the process of preparing five (5) U.S. provisional patent applications and one (1) U.S. design patent application. Our patents and applications relate, among others, to:

● | Storage bag use for a tonneau cover; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Tonneau system for use with a pickup truck; 
● | Latches and rails for use in tonneau truck covers; and 
● | Portable power systems. 

 
Granted U.S. patents will expire between 2032 and 2039, excluding any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. If issued, pending applications would expire in 2041, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent and any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations.
 
All patents issued to our Chief Executive Officer, Steven Rossi, have been assigned to the Company or will be assigned to the Company upon being issued by the USPTO.
 
Trademarks
 
The Company has 15 trademarks in various states of pending, registered and allowed in the United States, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and Canada.
 
Government Regulation
 
Other than standard business licenses, no permits or regulatory approvals are required to distribute Worksport products to clients in any of the areas in which we operate.
The Market
 
Our revenue is directly proportional to sales of pickup trucks. The following graph shows sales of specialty equipment retail sales of aftermarket automotive accessories in the United States in billions from 2016, through the third quarter of 2019 and estimates those sales into 2023.

The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has not critically affected the pickup truck market. In 2020, new vehicle sales were under 15 million, with light trucks accounting for approximately 74% of total sales in the United States.
 
This current growth trend is fueled by a decade average of strong overall economic performance, including an ongoing decade average decline in unemployment and growth in consumer spending. A strong economy paired with rising consumer confidence suggest that consumers are willing to spend capital on discretionary items, such as specialty automotive parts. While new vehicle sales have leveled off, they still remain at near-record highs—close to 15 million per year. Recently announced tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, etc. and other policy changes could affect the economy and the automotive industry, however, demand continues to remain strong for new pickup trucks in North America.
 
The Statista Market Outlook suggests that pickup trucks will continue to be the number one selling vehicle in North America. Pickup truck upgrades are the largest sector of the specialty equipment industry, accounting for 27% of total retail dollars (about $12.03 Billion). In the United States alone, there are over 158.6 million registered light trucks. Despite the growth of crossover vehicles (CUV) overall, full-size pickups remain the most common vehicle subtype on the road today. This is likely driven by the continued popularity of domestic half-ton pickups (e.g., Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, Ram 1500) throughout the United States, especially in the U.S. southern states.
 
While there is increasing interest in electrification by automakers, less than 1% of light vehicles are electrified thus far. This will be the decade where mass adoption takes place. The electric pickup truck market is very promising. Under the push of EV’s worldwide and legal policies in states like California banning non-eco truck sales by 2035, we believe that a sizable amount of customers will be looking to purchase and upgrade to newer trucks. EV pickup truck sales are suggested to grow at a 58% change of annual grown rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2030.
 
The top registered make and models of pickup trucks in the United States are shown below.
 
Top Registered Models
 

GM Full-Size Pickup | 17.6 | M
-------------------------+------+--
Ford F-Series | 15.6 | M
Ram Pickup | 7.6 | M
Toyota Tacoma | 3.2 | M
Ford Ranger | 2.3 | M
Chevrolet Silverado 2500 | 2.1 | M
Toyota Tundra | 2.0 | M

 
of the roughly 56 million pickups in the United States today, nearly 60% of them are either GM Full-Size or Ford F-Series, and account for almost 12% of all vehicles on the road. The Ram Pickup is third. All three brands are ideal target markets for our products.

2019 New Pickup Truck Sales in the United States by Month (All Models)
 

With 2019 year-end sales of almost 900,000 units, the Ford F-Series was the best-selling light truck in the United States. The Ford F-Series is a series of full-size pickup trucks, the most popular variant being the F-150. The 14th generation of this model was released in 2020.
 
After years of recovery in demand for vehicles, U.S. car and light truck sales growth slowed down in 2019, compared with 2018. U.S. light vehicle sales came to around 17 million units in 2019, some 12.2 million of which were light trucks. With the exception of Toyota pickups, light trucks built by U.S.-based automakers continue to be favorites among U.S. vehicle buyers. The Ford F-Series, which has been one of the most popular automobiles with U.S. buyers for years, was ranked as the best-selling light truck in the United States at year-end 2019. The second spot was claimed by Chrysler’s Ram Pickup, followed by GM’s Chevrolet Silverado and the Toyota Tacoma.

Distribution
 
We distribute our tonneau covers are through wholesalers and online retail channels in Canada and the United States. We will also provide our tonneau covers for private labels and Original Equipment Manufacturers.
 
The specialty equipment (aftermarket) consists of three major types of customers which include master warehouse distributors, dealers and wholesalers, and retail end consumers. Master warehouse distributors will stock and distribute products to their customers, which are usually local dealers and wholesalers. Dealers and wholesalers are local stores which sell products to some businesses and retail consumers in their area and online. Dealers will purchase most of their products from their local distributor who will deliver to them regularly. Retail end consumers are simply the end users of the products.
 
The Original Manufacturing Market (OEM) consists of vehicle manufactures with corporate offices and distribution points globally. Specifically, within North America, Worksport’s target customers in OEM markets include but are not limited to:
 

● | Toyota Motor Co; 
--+---------------------------------
● | Lordstown Motors Corp; 
● | Rivian; 
● | Ford Motor Co; 
● | Nissan Motor Co; 
● | General Motors; and 
● | FCA Automotive (Ram Trucks).

Worksport currently has two OEM partnerships with the electric-truck manufacturers, Hercules Electric Vehicles and Atlis Motor Vehicles. These partnerships are currently in the development stage whereby we intend to work with these companies to explore integrating our TerraVis solar tonneau cover with Hercules and Atlis’ EV pickup truck models.
 
Competition
 
In our estimation, for many years, consumers looking to purchase tonneau covers have had a limited amount of options available to them and mostly consisted of:

1. | Soft Folding & Roll-up covers (Vinyl covers); 
---+----------------------------------------------------------
2. | Solid one piece caps and lids (Plastic & Fiberglass); 
3. | Retractable Covers (Plastic & Aluminum); and 
4. | Hard Folding & Standing Covers (Aluminum and FRP). 

 
Solid one piece covers and retractable covers are the least desirable because of their limited functionality and overall cost. We believe that consumers want a less cumbersome tonneau cover with high functionality and at a lower cost.
 
That is why the most popular covers in today’s market are soft and hard folding/rolling tonneau covers and the biggest growth opportunity in the tonneau cover market is the aggressively priced hard folding tonneau cover market niche.
 
Our largest competitor is Truck Hero which has acquired upwards of 13 independent tonneau cover brands in North America. Truck Hero’s products directly compete with our products.
 
Our second largest competitor is Truck Accessory Group (TAG), however, TAG’s products do not directly compete with those of ours.
 
We believe that by being independent, aggressively priced, innovative, and operationally sound, we will be able to grow revenues with minimal sales effort while continuing to develop our relationships with our larger clients.
 
Furthermore, we believe our Company is currently the only independent Business-to-Business (B2B) producer of tonneau covers in the United States and Canada that does not sell directly to customers (B2C). Worksport believes that we can expand our current customer base throughout our current and future markets and is evaluating entering various B2C channels to boost sales of new products.
 
Our business plan moving forward is to sell our products to the 60,000 existing auto parts retailers throughout the United States. Our products are currently being distributed to 17,000 of these stores.
 
The Company also plans to eventually expand to other markets outside the United States and Canada. We intend to generate revenue in new markets from the automotive specialty equipment markets and global Original Equipment Manufacturers.
 
Our goal is to become the leader in the tonneau cover market through innovation. Our main objective is to design and engineer our products to better suit today’s new, dynamic, and innovative models of light trucks and electric trucks with TerraVis.
