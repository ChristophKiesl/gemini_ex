General
Veoneer, Inc. (“Veoneer”, the “Company” or “we”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive office in Stockholm, Sweden. Veoneer was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2017 for the purpose of holding this business. On June 29, 2018, Veoneer became an independent company as a result of the separation of the Electronics segment from Autoliv, Inc. (“Autoliv”). The separation was completed in the form of a pro rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of Veoneer to the stockholders of Autoliv (the “Spin-Off”). The Company functions as a holding corporation and owns two principal subsidiaries, Veoneer AB and Veoneer US, Inc.
Shares of Veoneer common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VNE”. Swedish Depository Receipts representing shares of Veoneer common stock (“SDRs”) trade on NASDAQ Stockholm under the symbol “VNE SDB”. Our fiscal year ends on December 31.
On October 30, 2019, Veoneer signed definitive agreements to sell its 51% ownership in Veoneer Nissin Brake Japan ("VNBJ") and Veoneer Nissin Brake China ("VNBZ"), the entities that comprised VNBS at the time of such agreements, to its joint venture partner Nissin-Kogyo Co., Ltd., and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. The consideration received was $176 million. The transaction was completed on February 3, 2020 under the definitive agreements, and the VNBS joint venture was terminated. See Note 6 "Divestiture and Held for Sale" for additional information.
On April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a non-binding agreement with Volvo Cars Corporation ("VCC") to separate the businesses of Zenuity, a 50% ownership joint venture with VCC, into two separate business with each JV partner absorbing the business most relevant to its strategic interests and direction. The parties entered into definitive agreements and effected the separation on July 1, 2020. As part of the transaction the Company paid approximately $37 million to Zenuity for 200 software engineers and two business units located in Germany and the US.
On August 10, 2020, Veoneer signed a definitive agreement to sell the majority of the Veoneer Brake Systems (VBS) business in North America to ZF Active Safety US, Inc (ZF). The aggregate purchase price was $1. In connection with the transaction, the Company received approximately $22 million from ZF for VBS operational cost reimbursement.

Additional information required by this Item 1 regarding developments in the Company’s business during 2020 is contained under Item 7 in this Annual Report.
Financial Information on Segments
Until August 10, 2020, Veoneer had two operating segments, Electronics and Brake Systems. The Electronics segment includes all safety electronics resources and expertise, Restraint Control Systems and Active Safety products. The Brake Systems segment included brake control and actuation systems. 
As noted above, Veoneer divested the vast majority of its Brake Systems business. The remaining Brake Systems business is no longer a reportable segment due to immateriality.
Business Strategy
We believe Veoneer is well-positioned for growth from increasing long-term global vehicle production volumes, increased demand for safety and for collaborative and autonomous driving products. This is evidenced by the Company's strong order book. Veoneer is focused on accelerating the commercialization of Active Safety and Collaborative and Autonomous Driving by providing the software, sensors and the central computer platforms required to do so. Our products provide a significant benefit to society by reducing human fatalities and injuries related to automobile traffic accidents.
As a consequence of the restructuring activities in 2020 and the establishment of ArriverTM, Veoneer is considering changes to its operating structure to further focus on our product offering, effective cost management, and overall operational excellence. 
Products and Technology
Veoneer provides a portfolio of automotive safety electronics. The portfolio includes Active Safety Systems (including sensors) and perception and driving policy software for ADAS, HAD and AD solutions, and Restraint Control Systems such as ECUs and crash sensors for deployment of airbags and seatbelt pretensioners in the event of a collision. 
Active Safety Systems
The goal of Active Safety systems is to provide early warnings to alert drivers to take timely and appropriate action or trigger intelligent systems that affect the vehicle’s motion, to prevent the occurrence of accidents, or reduce the severity of, any such accidents, as well as to increase the comfort and convenience of driving. Active Safety systems can also improve the effectiveness of the restraint control systems, which combine hazard information with traditional crash-sensing methods.
Active Safety and Driver Assistance features and functions include: Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), which brakes a vehicle autonomously; Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), which keeps and adjusts the vehicle’s pre-set speed to keep a pre-set distance from vehicles ahead; Traffic Jam Assist (TJA) and Highway Assist, which takes control of braking and acceleration in slow-moving traffic and highway speed, respectively; Forward Collision Warning (FCW); Blind Spot Detection (BSD); Rear Cross-Traffic Assist (RCTA); Lane Departure Warning (LDW); Lane Centering Assist (LCA), Traffic Sign Detection (TSD); Light Source Recognition (LSR); Driver Monitoring for driver attention and drowsiness; In-cabin monitoring, Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication and Night Driving Assist.
Veoneer has one of the broadest ADAS product portfolio offerings in the market, which includes all major sensing technologies, perception and driving policy software, central compute and digital mapping technologies and cloud solutions. When considering this hardware and software suite of technologies Veoneer is able to provide “turn-key solutions” when our OEM customers require 5-star NCAP solutions, thereby Veoneer can provide the entire system or even sub-systems when required.
Our product portfolio has been significantly expanded over the recent years from individual hardware sensing components to a full range of key features and functions. This enables Veoneer to address our customer needs today, and likely in the future, with a complete system offering of ADAS and AD solutions for consumer-based vehicles and specific sub-system solutions for robo-taxi applications.
Overall Veoneer has been awarded business with 17 original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) globally. Key products and systems in the Company's Active Safety sensor portfolio, either currently provided to the market or under product development, include:
Vision Systems: Vision systems are critical to driver assistance and safety functions. They support the driver in collision avoidance and mitigating the crash severity in the event of an accident. Using our internally developed software algorithms, the camera looks at the road ahead for other vehicles, road signs, lane markings, traffic lights, intersections and other key road attributes to provide information and warnings if a vehicle is approaching a potentially hazardous traffic situation. Vision systems are used in applications such as road-sign recognition and lane detection, along with forward and pedestrian collision warnings. We offer forward looking mono-vision and stereo-vision systems:
•The mono-vision system is a forward-looking camera that is mounted behind the windshield in front of the rear-view mirror. Images are interpreted by algorithms that help identify objects and assist the driver with warnings or actuation such as lane keeping and automatic braking of the vehicle. Mono-vision systems provide a significant level of accident reductions and are fundamental to achieve NCAP 5-star safety levels as well as driver comfort and convenience features like Adaptive Cruise Control.
•Stereo-vision system technology goes a step further and measures the entire driving environment with superior accuracy and depth. The system is capable of acting on any object without classification. Stereo-vision also provides free-space recognition, and road surface measurement down to millimeter level accuracy, which is important to OEMs to improve safety and comfort and provides depth perception for distance calculations due to the 3D capability.
Next generation vision systems and algorithms such as our fourth-generation mono and stereo-cameras, which went into initial production in 2019, support AD and European New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”) 2020. Fifth generation vision systems, which are in the early development stages, and planned for production in 2024 will offer more than five times higher image resolution than the current generations of camera solutions and deep learning, as well as offer multiple camera solutions. Selected customers where Veoneer has been awarded and sourced business for its vision systems include: Geely, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo Cars, Subaru, two major global OEMs, and two local Chinese OEMs in addition to Geely.
Night Vision Systems: Using passive infrared technology (thermal sensing), our night vision system identifies pedestrians, animals and certain other hazards present in the danger zone of a vehicle, and alerts the driver, particularly in nighttime, or other “challenging” conditions. Our night vision system is the key component in “dynamic light spot” pedestrian illumination system which allows more time for drivers to identify potential hazards at distances beyond normal head-lights. Our fourth-generation night vision system, which launched during 2020, has improved field of view and detection distances, reduction in size, weight and cost, featuring enhanced algorithms for pedestrian, animal and vehicle detection as well as supporting night time AEB solutions. Selected customers of the night vision system include Audi, BMW, GM, Mercedes-Benz, PSA, Porsche and Volkswagen.
Radar Systems: Radar systems capture and analyze driving conditions and alert the driver to potentially dangerous situations, and can take control of the vehicle if the driver does not take timely, appropriate action. Radar systems are used in functions such as ACC and AEB. Radar is important because it provides superior performance in poor weather conditions such as rain and fog and other situations with limited or poor visibility from the camera system. Fused with vision systems, higher levels of functional safety are possible, allowing a wider range of operating conditions. Our radar sensor portfolio includes: 25GHz ultra-wide band radar, 24 GHz narrow band radar, and 77GHz front and rear corner, and front center radars. We also see future market opportunities for radar based in-cabin monitoring solutions that will address the issue of unattended children left in vehicles, a functionality that is expected to be fundamental for achieving 5-star NCAP ratings in Europe from 2025 onwards as well as being potentially mandated in North America as part of the “Hot Cars Act of 2019”, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in July 2020 and is pending approval by the U.S. Senate. Another promising technology is the Imaging Radar to address needs of higher driving automation. Selected customers for our radar systems include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), GAC, Geely, General Motors (GM), Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault Nissan Mitsubishi, and Volvo Cars. Veoneer has been awarded and sourced business with 13 OEM customers.
ADAS Central Compute: ADAS ECUs are emerging products within the Active Safety market and are precursors to the autonomous vehicles of the future. Today, a limited number of OEMs are using ADAS Domain controller ECUs, as most of the ADAS functionalities are embedded in the sensors in a distributed architecture. With future ADAS and AD systems increasing in complexity, the need for multi-sensor solutions and subsequently higher processing capabilities is expected to lead to more OEMs installing ADAS domain control or cross-domain ECUs their vehicles. While in current systems sensor data processing and perception algorithms are mostly taking in place in the sensors, more advanced ADAS/AD functionalities put higher requirements on sensors, which drives the trend to centralize processing functions to get the most accurate understanding of the vehicle's relationship with its environment.
In the ADAS ECU, large quantities of data from the vehicle’s different sensors are analyzed and validated. Advanced algorithms can then act in real time to warn the driver and control the vehicle throttle, braking and steering torque to follow a desired trajectory for full AD. We believe one of the biggest challenges self-driving cars will have to overcome is being able to react to the randomness of traffic flow, other drivers, and the fact that no two driving situations are ever the same.
Utilizing deep learning (artificial intelligence) and sensor fusion, algorithms in the ADAS ECU can likely be enhanced in such a way that the vehicle will be able to make better decisions than a human driver. This processing must be done with multiple levels of redundancy to ensure the highest level of safety and reliability. The computing demands of driverless vehicles are 50 to 100 times more extensive than the most advanced vehicle today. Meeting these demands will be a major challenge in developing the next generation of ADAS ECUs, including data processing.
In 2016, we launched the world’s first ADAS ECU for mass production in Mercedes-Benz’s new E-class. We provide a similar solution to the updated Mercedes-Benz S-class, and have received new business awards with VCC and Geely over the next 18 months.
Safety Domain ECUs: As Active and Passive Safety features become more advanced, having dedicated ECUs for the various features increases the complexity, weight and cost of the vehicle architecture. The Safety Domain ECU replaces multiple dedicated ECUs across the vehicle by combining all Active and Passive Safety ECUs into one powerful domain controller. This requires a highly powerful processor that is able to execute simultaneous computing. Techniques such as virtualization enable the safe and secure separation of computing tasks, as the other controllers are not affected if one virtual controller fails.
Lidar: In 2017, we agreed to collaborate with Velodyne to expand and commercialize our lidar development. Lidar is expected to be an important sensor technology for the future development of AD systems. Under the current non-exclusive agreement with Velodyne, Veoneer acts as the Tier-1 supplier to the OEMs for the Velodyne lidar sensors. Veoneer provides project management services, product validation and verification, system/interface packaging and manufacturing to produce automotive-grade lidar systems to the OEMs. Our lidar product roadmap includes first providing it to test fleets of the OEMs and the robo-taxis market followed by developing a solid-state design for the consumer vehicle market.
Building on this relationship, on January 7, 2019 the Company announced entry into a license and supply agreement with Velodyne whereby Velodyne provides Veoneer US, Inc. with materials and rights to certain Velodyne intellectual property that enables Veoneer US, Inc. to sell, distribute, promote, manufacture and modify, including related research and development ("R&D") certain lidar products based on a Velodyne based reference design.
Driver Monitoring: We have been developing solutions to address driver distraction and fatigue as they relate to traditional driving situations and driver attention for hands-free driving. In 2017, we entered into an agreement with Seeing Machines to accelerate this effort. It appears very likely that this technology is going to be mandated as part of the General Safety Requirements (GSR) in Europe to obtain vehicle homologation for new vehicle types by 2024 and for all new vehicles from 2026. It is expected to be necessary to achieve a 5-star NCAP rating in Europe in 2025 as well as Level 3/4 autonomy solutions worldwide. Our non-exclusive agreement with Seeing Machines to utilize their reference design and market under a license, provides Veoneer the capability to build hardware and feature level solutions on top of Seeing Machines’ world leading head pose, gaze and recognition data outputs.
RoadScape: Our RoadScapeTM product line offers highly accurate satellite positioning along with world leading dead reckoning capabilities for increased precision in highway, urban and rural areas. Building on this, our RoadScapeTM platform provides a digital representation of the road ahead that can be further enhanced through probe data in the field and cloud connectivity. Adding RoadScapeTM communication technology allows for vehicle-to-vehicle, infrastructure and cloud connectivity for premonition and situational awareness in ADAS and AD.
Human Machine Interaction (“HMI”): Effective two-way communication between the vehicle and driver is critical to building driver trust and enhancing the driver experience. Veoneer’s Learning Intelligent Vehicle (“LIV”) is an artificial intelligence-equipped research vehicle that can understand and respond to context. LIV uses external and internal sensing combined with complex artificial intelligence algorithms to create a unified contextual picture of what is going on with the occupants, vehicle, driving situation and then acts and serves as a “co-pilot” to communicate with drivers and passengers. Veoneer uses LIV to learn more about: task delegation, shared control, driver-vehicle collaboration, innovative ways to increase driver understanding of an autonomous system, and to continually improve the system’s understanding of its human co-travelers.
ADAS, HAD and AD System Level Software Solutions (Arriver™ Products)
On April 2, 2020, the Company entered into a non-binding agreement with Volvo Cars Corporation (VCC) to separate the businesses of Zenuity, a 50% ownership joint venture with VCC, into two separate business with each JV partner absorbing the business most relevant to its strategic interests and direction. The parties entered into definitive agreements and effected the separation on July 1, 2020. As part of the transaction the Company added approximately 200 software engineers to its software engineering team to enable the development of the Company's next-generation perception and driving policy software stack. 
In January 2021, Veoneer and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. signed an agreement under which the companies will collaborate on the delivery of scalable ADAS, Collaborative and AD solutions. The collaborative platform will integrate Veoneer's next-generation perception and driving policy software stack (Arriver™ Products) and Qualcomm® Snapdragon Ride™ ADAS/AD scalable portfolio of System on a Chip (SoC) and Accelerators. The platform will address the growing needs of the automotive ecosystem for scalable and upgradable solutions, which requires highly advanced and power-efficient compute, connectivity and cloud service capabilities across all vehicle tiers. Veoneer and Qualcomm Technologies have been working together since the first announcement of their collaboration in August 2020 to create a roadmap of a scalable, open ADAS and AD system that will be able to address the entire automotive OEM market with an integrated software and SoC platform. 
Restraint Control Systems
The Restraint Control System is the brain triggering a vehicle’s Passive Safety system in a crash situation. Restraint Control Systems consist of a restraint ECU and related remote crash sensors, including acceleration and pressure sensors. The ECUs algorithms decide when a seatbelt pretensioner should be triggered and an airbag system should be deployed.
The ECU is mounted centrally in the vehicle, well protected from the environment in the event of a crash, and is supported by crash sensors mounted in the door beam, the pillars between the doors, the rocker panels and/or in various locations at the front and rear of the vehicle. These “satellite” crash sensors provide acceleration data to enable early and appropriate deployment of the airbags and seatbelt pretensioners within milliseconds of a vehicle crash.
The ECU also contains certain sensors that are common with the brake system. We were the first to offer this type of solution, providing savings through the reduction in multiple sensors for measuring yaw rate, and consolidating this information on the vehicle data bus. Additionally, the Restraint Control System is capable of recording details of what happened before and during a crash event using an Event Data Recorder (“EDR”) with the restraint control ECU.
Selected customers include FCA, Ford, Geely, GM, Great Wall, Hyundai/Kia, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, PSA, Renault Nissan Mitsubishi, Suzuki, VW and Volvo Cars.
Collaboration History
Over the last several years collaborations with key strategic partners have significantly influenced the development and evolution of our product portfolio. These include multiple collaborative commercial arrangements, as well as the Brake Systems joint venture with Nissin-Kogyo Co. Ltd., and Zenuity, the joint venture with Volvo Cars Corporation (VCC) to develop ADAS Software towards AD. 
Following a strategic review initially launched in April 2019, Veoneer made a decision to narrow its focus to the commercialization of Active Safety and advanced ADAS in the Collaborative Driving space by providing customers with the software, sensors and the central-compute platforms required to do so. In pursuit of this goal, Veoneer elected to exit the Brake Systems business, which was substantially completed in 2020. Similarly, in 2020 Veoneer and VCC decided to separate the Zenuity business so each partner could focus on the technologies most critical for their customers, with Veoneer integrating and operating the business focused on development and commercialization of ADAS and HAD software and VCC assuming the Zenuity programs focus on AD.
In January 2021, Veoneer formalized a collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to deliver an integrated software and SoC platform that will address the growing needs of the automotive ecosystem for scalable and upgradable solutions. ArriverTM is Veoneer’s dedicated software unit for the development of the complete perception and drive policy software stack for the platform.
Veoneer continues to maintain and pursue partnerships and collaborations with partners that have the potential to enable the commercialization of Active Safety and advanced ADAS in the Collaborative Driving space.

Market Overview and Competitive Landscape
Automotive Supplier Market Overview
The automotive production value chain is split among OEMs such as General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen and automotive suppliers, such as ourselves, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Magna, Valeo and ZF. Veoneer acts mainly as a Tier-1 supplier to OEMs, meaning that we sell products directly to OEMs.
Our underlying market is primarily driven by two critical factors: Global Light Vehicle Production (“LVP”) and Content Per Vehicle (“CPV”), whereby CPV is the clear market driver for the growth of our Total Addressable Market ("TAM").
Light Vehicle Production: Over the last two decades, LVP has increased at an average annual growth rate of around 2% despite the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. The LVP is expected to increase from 72 million vehicles in 2020, to 92 million in 2025, where approximately 86 million where produced in 2019, according to IHS Markit. The 
market is undergoing a shift from traditional internal combustion engine ("ICE") vehicles, to HEVs and EVs, as emission regulations become more stringent, and battery technology continues to evolve in cost and performance.
Content Per Vehicle: Unlike LVP, we can directly influence the CPV by introducing new technologies to the market. Looking ahead, we expect the Active and Safety electronics CPV growth will primarily be driven by Active Safety content (including software), with the total Active Safety market growing from approximately $115 per vehicle in 2020 to approximately $275 per vehicle in 2026. The shift in power train technologies mentioned earlier has little effect on the Safety Electronics CPV.
See Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities” for additional information related to recent trends in LVP and CPV.
Active Safety Competitive Landscape
The Active Safety market remains a highly fragmented and highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on technology, innovation, quality, delivery and price. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop advanced hardware and software technology solutions and to maintain or improve on our already strong competitive position over our existing and any new competitors. Main competitors in Active Safety include Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Magna, Mando, Mobis, Valeo, ZF, and Intel/Mobileye as a Tier 2 vision software provider.
On a broader scale, we have seen significant shifts in our competitive landscape over the last several years. Technology companies have increased their presence and influence in ADAS and AD either through acquisitions or forming “ecosystems” around certain technologies with OEMs and other suppliers. This has led to new industry entrants like Apple, Waymo, Intel, Lyft, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Uber, which also provide partnership or customer opportunities for Veoneer hardware and software solutions.
Through acquisitions, technology partnerships and licensing agreements, along with our customers we have continuously added key building blocks and we estimate capturing a market share of approximately 8% in Active Safety in 2020. 
The TAM for our Active Safety products amounted to approximately $8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to approximately $26 billion in 2026, a 21% CAGR.
ADAS, HAD and AD System Level Software Solutions (Arriver™ Products) Competitive Landscape
The market for ADAS and AD software is in its early development. Currently, Veoneer treats this market as part of the total Active Safety TAM, as separate valuations of a dedicated software opportunity are not available. As for the total Active Safety market, the competition is fragmented. Some Tier 1 automotive suppliers, such as Bosch and Continental, are developing software either for perception only, or for both perception and drive policy. MobilEye, as a Tier 2 automotive supplier, is developing perception software and adding drive policy to its offering, and has established market presence. NVIDIA appears to be pursuing a similar strategy, but does not have a commercial presence today, however a number of cooperation agreements with OEMs makes the future introduction of NVIDIA software likely. 
To some extent, this type of software is also developed by the OEMs themselves. However, OEM strategies for ADAS software development varies widely, with a few developing the majority of the software in-house and others buying all or most of it from outside suppliers. The Company already has an established market presence, primarily through development of four generations of vision perception software and the drive policy software initially developed in the Zenuity joint venture and now launched commercially in a number of Volvo models.
Restraint Control Systems Competitive Landscape
The market for restraint control systems, in comparison to the Active Safety market, remains relatively consolidated with both traditional electronics suppliers and some Passive Safety suppliers. Over the past few years, we have seen our market share increase mainly due to cost efficient integration solutions and strong customer relationships built on quality and technology advancements. Currently we are a leading supplier of Restraint Control Systems with an estimated market share of approximately 22% in 2020. Our largest competitors include Bosch, Continental, Denso and ZF.
The total restraint control systems market amounted to approximately $3 billion in 2020 and is expected to remain at the same level until 2026. We believe that restraint control systems will play an integral role in a larger integration trend towards centralized Safety Domain Controllers in the future. In addition, our strong market position in restraint control systems will provide opportunities to become a leading supplier in the ADAS ECU and eventually the Safety Domain Controller market.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property
Our ability to maintain our position at the forefront of technology innovations and to serve customers on a local basis will be differentiating factors to our success. Therefore, we maintain one of the broadest global networks of technical engineering centers across all major automotive regions to develop and provide advanced products, processes and manufacturing support for our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis.
We currently own or co-own approximately 900 active patents and have approximately 600 pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. The active patents will expire between 2021 and 2040. We have registered the name Veoneer as a trademark in [Sweden] and are pursuing registration in other markets of interest. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic.
We are actively pursuing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to the automotive industries, and we selectively utilize other companies’ licenses through sub-licenses in order to support our business interests. These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights.
We believe that our patents, trademarks and licenses, provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations and as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business or any of our business segments to be materially dependent upon any individual patent, trademark or license.
We seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by evaluating the market and profit potential of existing and new customer programs, including investments in innovation and technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products and distinctive technologies.
Our total research and development expenses, including engineering, net of customer reimbursements, were $407 million, $562 million and $466 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Veoneer's 50% share of Zenuity’s net expenses, as reported in loss from equity method investment, was $39 million, $70 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs were mainly related to research and development. 
We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allows us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovations to market. We believe that a continued focus on engineering activities are crucial to maintaining our pipeline of advanced technologies to become automotive grade products to meet our customer, regulatory and consumer demands.
Dependence on Customers
Veoneer serves most of the world’s major automotive OEMs and is not dependent on one single customer. Our customer base has consistently increased and become more diversified over the last five years, mainly driven by our Active Safety product offerings and Brake Systems.
During 2020 Veoneer delivered production units to more than 20 OEM customers around the world. Our largest customers ranked in order as a % of our global sales were Daimler 20%, Hyundai/Kia 12%, Honda 11%, Ford 11%, General Motors 7%, FCA 6%, Renault Nissan Mitsubishi 5% and BMW 4%. In 2020, according to IHS Markit, in terms of LVP the top five largest OEMs accounted for approximately 50% of the global LVP while the top ten largest accounted for approximately 70%. In 2020, these same top five and top ten largest OEMs represent approximately 25% and 60% of our global sales, respectively.
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through written contracts or purchase orders that are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. These arrangements include terms regarding price, quality, technology and delivery. Although it may vary from customer to customer, our customer contracts generally require us to supply a customer’s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly facilities, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model, which is generally four to seven years. Because we produce products for a broad cross section of vehicle models, we are not overly reliant on any one vehicle model or one particular product.
These contracts are often subject to renegotiation, sometimes as frequent as on an annual basis, which may affect product pricing. In general, these arrangements with our customers provide that the customer can terminate them if we do not meet specified quality, delivery and cost requirements. Although these arrangements may be terminated at any time by our customers (but not typically by us), such terminations have historically been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of 
operations. However, if terminations do occur in the future or if production under a contract winds down earlier than expected, then such event could have a material impact on our results of operations. The arrangements typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products. 
Veoneer Human Capital Management
As a leading automotive technology company, the development and well-being of our employees is a key component for success. We focus on individual growth, fairness as an employer, employment terms, values, ethics and conduct, and most importantly the health and safety of our employees.
Our philosophy is to give our associates responsibility for their growth through providing challenges in their jobs as well as the tools and culture necessary to support individual growth. We believe that growth is primarily accomplished within the scope of our associates' daily work and, if supported with ways to reflect and receive feedback, we can help facilitate and accelerate that growth. Veoneer's size and global reach, combined with its varied product portfolio, provides many opportunities to work in new areas and with new teams. It is important to us to foster an environment that promotes giving and receiving feedback, setting aggressive targets and doing so in a transparent way. We have processes in place to foster this behavior and we have desired behaviors defined to set goals for the purpose of recruiting and promoting.
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of approximately 7,543 total associates, with 4,476 engineering, 1,452 in direct manufacturing and the remaining 1,615 in production and SG&A overhead functions. Included in these figures are approximately 1,359 temporary associates, and within engineering, more than two thirds of the associates worked as software engineers. 
We compete in a market that involves rapidly changing technological and other developments, which requires us to attract and employ a workforce with broad expertise and intellectual capital. Our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we are committed to making Veoneer a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. 
We are committed to maintaining, and fostering a culture of fairness and equity, where all of us act with the highest ethics and integrity, where unethical conduct is not tolerated, and where everyone feels empowered to speak up and raise concerns. Employee training is used to reinforce these values across all employees globally. Annual participation in trainings related to ethics, environment, health and safety, and emergency responses are at or near 100%.
We consider our relationship with our personnel to be strong. We have not had any disputes which are significant or had a lasting impact on our relationship with our employees, customer perception of our employee practices or our business results. Major unions to which some of our employees belong in Europe include: IG Metall in Germany; Unite in the United Kingdom; Confédération Générale des Travailleurs, Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail, and Force Ouvrière in France; and If Metall, Unionen, Sveriges Ingenjörer and Akademikerföreningen in Sweden. In addition, our employees in other regions are represented by the following unions: Unifor and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”) in Canada. 
We have established competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plan, pension, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and on-site services, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.
The safety and health of our employees is a top priority. We recognize the connection between a safe and healthy workplace and the sustainable success of our company. We believe in healthy work-life balance, emphasizing employee engagement, working together, and having clear expectations. We have implemented a comprehensive Health and Safety Management System, which engages all employees and it guides us in our everyday actions. In 2020, our incident rate, measured as number of reportable injuries per 200,000 employee hours of exposure, was 1.29 (target is lower than 2.0). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
Inventory and Working Capital
We, as with other component manufactures in the automotive industry, ship our products to customer vehicle assembly facilities throughout the world on a “just-in-time” basis for our customers to maintain low inventory levels. Our suppliers (external suppliers as well as our own production sites) use a similar method in providing raw materials or sub-assemblies to us. In certain situations Veoneer utilizes consignment inventories with our supply base.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Sub-Components
We procure our raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured to minimize transportation, currency risks and other costs. The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products are various electronic semi-conductor components and ferrous metals for brake systems. From 2018 through mid-2020 we did not experience any significant supply shortages and therefore did not carry inventories more than those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules. During 2020, however, the automotive industry experienced dramatic declines in LVP during the first half, and an unprecedented rebound in the second half. This global development, which was witnessed across multiple industries, has created serious challenges for supply of electronic components, and specifically semiconductors. We expect the tightness in supply to affect global LVP during the first half of 2021. Currently, the effects are difficult to quantify, and we monitor and manage this situation daily.
Commodity cost volatility is a challenge for us and our industry. We are continually seeking to manage these costs using a combination of strategies, including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs, seeking alternative product designs and material specifications, continuous improvement VEVAs (Value Engineering, Value Analysis), combining our purchase requirements with our customers and/or suppliers, changing suppliers, hedging certain commodities and other means. Our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. We will continue our efforts to pass market-driven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts, including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire.
Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Our North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our Chinese customers generally reduce production during the Chinese New Year period in February. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality. In addition, engineering reimbursement tends to be skewed towards the fourth quarter.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to various environmental regulations governing, among other things: (i) the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, presence of, or exposure to hazardous materials; (ii) the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; (iii) the incorporation of certain chemical substances into our products, including electronic equipment; and (iv) the health and safety of our employees.
Most of the Company’s manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of components. As a result, the environmental impact from the Company’s plants is generally modest. While our businesses from time to time are subject to environmental investigations, there are no material environmental-related cases pending against the Company. Therefore, we do not incur (or expect to incur) any material costs or capital expenditures associated with maintaining facilities compliant with U.S. or non-U.S. environmental requirements. To reduce environmental risk, the Company has implemented an environmental policy and an environmental management system in all plants globally and all plants are externally ISO14001 certified.
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S., laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, health and safety, financial and other matters. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that impact our business, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.
Dependency on Government Contracts
We are not dependent on government contracts. Some R&D projects are partly financed by certain government agencies.
Spin-Off Related Agreements
As part of the Spin-Off, Autoliv underwent an internal reorganization, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to limited exceptions, all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the electronics business of Autoliv were retained by or transferred to Veoneer or our subsidiaries and all other assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) of Autoliv were retained by or transferred to Autoliv or its subsidiaries (other than Veoneer).
Following the Spin-Off, the Company and Autoliv began operating independently and neither has any ownership interest in the other. To govern certain ongoing relationships between Veoneer and Autoliv after the Spin-Off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, the Company and Autoliv entered into agreements pursuant to which certain services and rights are provided for following the Spin-Off, and the Company and Autoliv are obligated to indemnify each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses. 
Distribution Agreement
In connection with the internal reorganization, we entered into a Master Transfer Agreement with Autoliv which was amended and restated effective as of the Spin-Off (the “Distribution Agreement”). The Distribution Agreement governs certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of Veoneer and Autoliv and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among the companies and their subsidiaries. In particular, substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with the separated Electronics business were retained by or transferred to Veoneer or its subsidiaries and all other assets and liabilities were retained by or transferred to Autoliv or its subsidiaries. The Distribution Agreement also provided the principal corporate transactions required to affect the Spin-Off, certain conditions to the Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Veoneer and Autoliv with respect to and resulting from the completion of the Spin-Off. The Distribution Agreement also provides for indemnification obligations designed to make the Company financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the completion of the internal reorganization, as well as those obligations of Autoliv assumed by us pursuant to the Master Transfer Agreement; provided, however, certain warranty, recall and product liabilities for Electronics products manufactured prior to the completion of the internal reorganization were retained by Autoliv and Autoliv will indemnify us for any losses associated with such warranty, recall or product liabilities. 
Employee Matters Agreement
The Employee Matters Agreement governs Autoliv’s and Veoneer’s compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the current and former employees and non-employee directors of each company. Under the agreement, Autoliv is responsible for liabilities associated with Autoliv allocated employees and liabilities associated with former employees and Veoneer is responsible for liabilities associated with Veoneer allocated employees, but Autoliv retains and continues to be responsible for certain post-retirement liabilities relating to plans sponsored by Autoliv. The Employee Matters Agreement provided for the conversion of the outstanding awards granted under the Autoliv equity compensation programs into adjusted awards relating to both shares of Autoliv and Veoneer common stock.
Tax Matters Agreement
The Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Autoliv and Veoneer with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. The agreement also specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which Veoneer will bear responsibility and provides for certain indemnification provisions with respect to amounts for which they are not responsible. In addition, under the agreement, each party is expected to be responsible for any taxes imposed on Autoliv that arise from the failure of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement
Under the Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), Autoliv and Veoneer agreed to provide to each other certain services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the Spin-Off. The TSA terminated on April 1, 2020.
