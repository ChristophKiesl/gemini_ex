ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
BlueLinx is a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of residential and commercial building products with both branded and private-label stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across product categories such as lumber, panels, engineered wood, siding, millwork, metal building products, and other construction materials. With a strong market position, broad geographic coverage footprint servicing 40 states, and the strength of a locally focused sales force, we distribute our comprehensive range of products to over 15,000 national, regional, and local dealers, specialty distributors, national home centers, and manufactured housing customers. BlueLinx is able to provide a wide range of value added services and solutions to our customers and suppliers. We are headquartered in Georgia, with executive offices located at 1950 Spectrum Circle, Marietta, Georgia, and we operate our distribution business through a broad network of distribution centers. 
 As a “two-step” wholesale distributor of building products, BlueLinx stocks products from leading manufacturers, such as Huber Engineered Woods, James Hardie, Georgia Pacific, Weyerhaeuser, and Oldcastle, and supplies these products to a broad range of customers, including lumber yards, dealers, home centers, and hardware stores. These customers then serve residential and commercial builders and contractors in their respective geographic areas. BlueLinx plays a critical role in enabling its lumber yard, dealer, and home center customers to offer a broad range of products and brands, as most of BlueLinx’s customers do not have the capability to purchase and warehouse directly from the manufacturers for such a large set of SKUs. Similarly, BlueLinx provides value to its manufacturer partners by enabling access to the fragmented network of lumber yards and dealers that the manufacturers could not adequately serve directly. Our place in this distribution model of building products provides easy access to the marketplace for our suppliers and the value proposition of rapid delivery on an as-needed basis to our customers from our network of warehouse facilities. In addition to its broad portfolio of building products, BlueLinx also offers a wide array of custom cutting and fabrication services for the wood products industry.
We were incorporated in the State of Georgia on March 8, 2004 as ABP Distribution Holdings, Inc. (“ABP”). ABP subsequently merged into BlueLinx Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on August 26, 2004, in connection with the spin-off by Georgia Pacific Corporation of its building products distribution division. On December 17, 2004, we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock.
On April 13, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Cedar Creek Holdings, Inc. (“Cedar Creek”). Cedar Creek was established in 1977 as a wholesale material distribution company that distributed wood products across the United States. Its products included specialty lumber, oriented strand board, siding, cedar, spruce, engineered wood products, and other building products which were complimentary to our portfolio. This acquisition allowed us to expand our product offerings, while maintaining our existing geographical footprint.
Significant Recent Transactions
Real Estate Transactions
During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed real estate financing transactions through sale-leaseback arrangements on fourteen of our distribution facilities. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we completed a real estate financing transaction through a sale-leaseback arrangement on one distribution facility. Gross proceeds for these transactions were $89.3 million. Net proceeds from these transactions were used to repay indebtedness under our term loan. Upon completion of the transactions, we entered into long-term leases with multiple renewal options on the properties. These real estate financing transactions are described in further detail in Note 12, Lease Commitments, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Products and Services
We distribute products in two principal categories: specialty products and structural products. Specialty products, which represented approximately 60 percent and 67 percent of our fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 net sales, respectively, include primarily engineered wood products, moulding, siding and trim, cedar, metal products (excluding rebar and remesh) and insulation. Structural products, which represented approximately 40 percent and 33 percent of our fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 net sales, respectively, include plywood, oriented strand board, rebar and remesh, lumber, spruce and other wood products primarily used for structural support in construction projects. In some cases, these products are branded by us.
We also provide a wide range of value-added services and solutions to our customers and suppliers including:
•providing “less-than-truckload” delivery services;
•pre-negotiated program pricing plans;
•inventory stocking;
•automated order processing through an electronic data interchange, or “EDI,” that provides a direct link between us and our customers;
•intermodal distribution services, including railcar unloading and cargo reloading onto customers’ trucks; 
•milling and fabrication services; and
•backhaul services, when otherwise empty trucks are returning from customer deliveries.
Distribution Channels
We sell products through three main distribution channels: warehouse sales, reload sales, and direct sales.
Warehouse sales are delivered from our warehouses to our customers. Reload sales are similar to warehouse sales but are shipped from third-party warehouses where we store owned products to enhance operating efficiencies. This channel is employed primarily to service strategic customers that would be less economical to service from our warehouses, and to distribute large volumes of imported products from port facilities. Warehouse and reload sales accounted for approximately 83 percent and 82 percent of our fiscal 2020 and 2019 gross sales, respectively. 
Direct sales are shipped from the manufacturer to the customer without our taking physical possession of the inventory and, as a result, typically generate lower margins than our warehouse and reload distribution channels. This distribution channel requires the lowest amount of committed capital and fixed costs. Direct sales accounted for approximately 17 percent and 18 percent of our fiscal 2020 and 2019 gross sales, respectively.
Competition
The U.S. building products distribution market is a highly fragmented market, served by national and multi-regional distributors, regionally focused distributors, and independent local distributors. Local and regional distributors tend to be closely held and often specialize in a limited number of product segments, in which they may offer a broader selection of products. Some of our national and multi-regional competitors are part of larger companies and, therefore, may have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. We compete on the basis of breadth of product offering, consistent availability of product, product price and quality, reputation, service, and distribution facility location.
Two of our largest competitors are Boise Cascade Company and Weyerhaeuser Company. Most major markets in which we operate are served by the distribution arm of at least one of these companies.
Seasonality
We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors common in the building products distribution industry. The first and fourth quarters are typically our lower volume quarters due to the impact of unfavorable weather on the construction market. Our second and third quarters are typically our higher volume quarters, reflecting an increase in construction, due to more favorable weather conditions. In past years, assuming no change in underlying inventory costs, our working capital has increased in second and third quarters, reflecting general increases in seasonal demand. During fiscal 2020, our inventory and working capital balances decreased during the second and third quarters, despite increasing commodity prices, due to enhancements in our working capital management throughout the year. During the ongoing novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, our typical patterns of seasonality changed, largely due to increased demand for our products. Milder weather in the latter part of 2020 also contributed to our traditional summer patterns continuing into the fourth quarter. While uncertain, it remains a possibility that changes to our typical seasonality trends could continue during fiscal 2021 should similar market conditions continue. 
Employees
As of January 2, 2021, we employed approximately 2,100 employees and less than one percent of our employees are employed on a part-time basis. Approximately 22 percent of our employees were represented by various local labor unions with terms and conditions of employment governed by collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”). Six CBAs covering approximately six percent of our employees are up for renewal in fiscal 2021.
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
The Company is subject to various federal, state, provincial, and local laws, rules, and regulations. We are subject to environmental laws, rules, and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials, substances, and wastes, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. These laws, ordinances, and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Many of them provide for substantial fines and penalties, orders (including orders to cease operations), and criminal sanctions for violations. They may also impose liability for property damage and personal injury stemming from the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. In addition, certain of our operations require us to obtain, maintain compliance with, and periodically renew, environmental permits.
Certain of these environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, may require the investigation and cleanup of an entity’s or its predecessor’s current or former properties, even if the associated contamination was caused by the operations of a third party. These laws also may require the investigation and cleanup of third-party sites at which an entity or its predecessor sent hazardous wastes for disposal, notwithstanding that the original disposal activity accorded with all applicable requirements. Liability under such laws may be imposed jointly and severally, and regardless of fault.
We are also subject to the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). In order to maintain compliance with applicable OSHA requirements, we have established uniform safety and compliance procedures for our operations, and implemented measures to prevent workplace injuries.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. We are also subject to the oversight of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”). Additionally, among other things, vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service are subject to both federal and state regulation. 
We have incurred and will continue to incur costs to comply with the requirements of environmental, health and safety, and transportation laws, ordinances, and regulations. These requirements could become more stringent in the future, and we cannot assure you that compliance costs will not be material.
