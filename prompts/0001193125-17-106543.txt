ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General 
 Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 2002, together with its six wholly owned subsidiaries and one majority owned subsidiary managed on a consolidated basis, is a development stage biopharmaceutical company that is primarily engaged in developing ethical pharmaceuticals for oncology and dermatology indications. Our goal is to develop alternative treatments that are safer, more effective, less invasive and more economical than conventional therapies. We develop and intend to license or market and sell our two prescription drug candidates, PV-10 and PH-10. We also hold patents and other intellectual property which we believe may be used in over-the-counter products, which we refer to as OTC products, and various other non-core technologies. We have transferred all our intellectual property related to OTC products and non-core technologies to our subsidiaries and have designated such subsidiaries as non-core to our primary business of developing our oncology and dermatology prescription drug candidates. 
 Prescription Drugs 
 We focus on developing our prescription drug candidates PV-10 and PH-10. We are developing PV-10 for treatment of several life threatening cancers including metastatic melanoma, liver cancer, and breast cancer. We are developing PH-10 to provide minimally invasive treatment of chronic severe skin afflictions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema. We believe that our prescription drug candidates will be safer and more specific than currently existing products. All of our prescription drug candidates are in either the pre-clinical or clinical trial stage. 
 The table below sets forth our two prescription drug candidates and our progress in developing those candidates for the indications shown:

 Oncology (PV-10)
Reported by Global Cancer Facts & Figures, 3rd Edition, according to estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there were 14.1 million new cancer cases in 2012 worldwide, of which 8 million occurred in economically developing 
 
3 
 
 countries, which contain about 82% of the worlds population. These estimates do not include non-melanoma skin cancers, which are not tracked in cancer registries. The corresponding estimates for total cancer deaths in 2012 were 8.2 million (about 22,000 cancer deaths a day)  2.9 million in economically developed countries, and 5.3 million in economically developing countries. By 2030, the global burden is expected to grow to 21.7 million new cancer cases and 13 million cancer deaths simply due to the growth and aging of the population. However, the estimated future cancer burden will probably be considerably larger due to the adoption of lifestyles that are known to increase cancer risk, such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and fewer pregnancies, in economically developing countries. Cancers related to these factors, such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancers, are already on the rise in economically transitioning countries. In economically developed countries, the three most commonly diagnosed cancers were prostate, lung, and colorectal among males, and breast, colorectal, and lung among females. In economically developing countries, the three most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, liver, and stomach in males, and breast, cervix uteri, and lung in females. In both economically developed and developing countries, the three most common cancer sites were also the three leading causes of cancer death. Rates of cancers common in Western countries will continue to rise in developing countries if preventive measures are not widely applied. The most common types of cancer also vary by geographic area. For example, among women breast cancer was the most common cancer in 19 out of the 21 world areas, while cervical cancer was the most common in the remaining two areas. Further variations are observed by examining individual countries. In 2012, the most common cancer site among males in most economically developed countries was prostate, with the exception of certain countries of Southern and Eastern Europe (lung cancer), Slovakia (colorectal cancer), and Japan (stomach cancer). Lung and stomach cancer were the top cancer sites in Asia. The greatest variation among males was in Africa, where the most common cancer was prostate, liver, Kaposi sarcoma, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal, leukemia, esophagus, or stomach. Among females, the most common cancer sites were either breast or cervical cancer, with the exceptions of China and North Korea (lung), South Korea (thyroid), and Mongolia and Laos (liver). 
 We believe our prescription drug candidate PV-10, a novel investigational drug, may afford competitive advantage compared to currently available options for the treatment of certain types of cancer; particularly solid tumors. Additional geographic variations exist as well. In short, we believe PV-10 is appropriate to treat any solid tumor anywhere. We are developing PV-10, a sterile injectable form of rose bengal disodium (Rose Bengal), for direct injection into tumors. It is an oncolytic immunotherapy agent that when injected intralesionally is tantamount to an in situ vaccination following acute and durable necrosis of diseased tissue. Because PV-10 is retained in diseased or damaged tissue but quickly dissipates from healthy tissue, we believe we can develop therapies that confine treatment to cancerous tissue and reduce collateral impact on healthy tissue. We have conducted phase 1 and phase 2 studies of PV-10 for the treatment of recurrent and metastatic melanoma, and phase 1 studies of PV-10 for the treatment of liver and breast cancers, each of which are described in more detail below. Furthermore, in 2015, we commenced a phase 3 study of PV-10 to treat locally advanced cutaneous melanoma as well as a phase 1b/2 study that combines PV-10 and pembrolizumab, both of which are described in more detail below. 
 Recurrent or Locally Advanced Cutaneous Melanoma and Widely Metastatic [Melanoma] Disease 
 According to Global Cancer Facts & Figures, 3rd Edition, estimated new cases for men in developed countries totaled 99,400 in 2012, and 91,700 for women. Estimated deaths continue to increase as well. PV-10 is potentially applicable for treating all stage III and IV patients, either as a neoadjuvant therapy, monotherapy, or in combination with a systemic agent for late stage patients in particular. 
 Our Phase 3 clinical trial of intralesional PV-10 as a melanoma treatment opened to enrollment in the first half of 2015, and we are actively recruiting and treating patients in centers in the U.S. and Australia. We are seeking 225 patients for this study, and although initial enrollment has been unacceptably slow due to evolving care standards and intense competition for patients and investigator resources in our traditional regions of clinical development in the U.S. and Australia, we have initiated steps to expand the study to include a total of 61 centers in the U.S., Australia, Europe, Russia, Latin America and China by the end of 2017; this is a substantial increase from 30 sites in the U.S., Australia and Europe that we projected would be necessary at the start of the study, and reflects the need to compete for patients on a global scale for large, specialized oncology studies. The primary outcome measure is progression-free survival, PFS, to be assessed every 12 weeks up to 18 months. The secondary outcome measures include complete response rate, CRR, and its duration to be set every 12 weeks up to 18 months and overall survival to be assessed every 12 weeks up to 18 months. Unlike our Phase 2 study, which was a single arm study, the Phase 3 study is a randomized trial. And we hope to demonstrate conclusively that PV-10 is both safe and effective and is statistically superior to the control therapy, investigators choice of systemic chemotherapy or intralesional oncolytic viral therapy. 
 Our estimated primary completion date is September 2018, and an estimated study completion date of October 2018. This compares to an estimated primary completion date of September 2017, and an estimated study completion date of October 2017, we made at the time of study initiation, and reflects cumulative delays in site startup and patient accrual due to competition for patients and investigator resources and rapidly evolving care standards for melanoma patients in the U.S. and Australia. When 50 percent of the 
 
4 
 
 events required for the primary endpoint have occurred, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee will report an interim assessment of efficacy and safety. So, meaningful clinical data could come well before the primary completion date, as documented on clinicaltrials.gov. 
 This phase 3 randomized controlled trial of PV-10 in patients with unresectable locally advanced cutaneous melanoma will assess response to PV-10 versus that of the investigators choice of systemic chemotherapy or intralesional oncolytic viral therapy in patients who have disease limited to cutaneous and subcutaneous sites and who are not candidates for systemic immunotherapy. Progression-free survival and complete response rate will be assessed using standard criteria (RECIST 1.1). Overall survival and exploratory assessment of patient reported outcomes related to lesion pain and other melanoma symptoms will also be assessed. 
 We are not alone in advocating for an intralesional approach in the treatment of cancer. For melanoma patients with recurrent or in-transit disease confined to their skin this approach has been used to treat patients for many years, as evidenced by guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN Guidelines®) defining the standard of care for cancer treatment in the United States. Intralesional injection with BCG and certain immunomodulatory agents, local ablation, topical therapy for superficial lesions and regional radiotherapy are recommended interventions for these patients, along with systemic therapy and participation in a clinical trial. We believe that, in this context, PV-10 is well positioned to show superiority in phase 3 testing as a single agent. 
 For those patients who do not have all disease accessible to injection, medical oncologists have stated that using an agent like PV-10 to prime the immune system could be synergistic in combination with a systemic agent. Our patent application on this strategy was published in 2012 and we have been vigorously pursuing this approach. We believe the nonclinical research we first presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) annual meeting that year, together with ongoing translational clinical research on PV-10s mechanism of action we are sponsoring at Moffitt and the University of Illinois at Chicago, and our own phase 2 data, provide a rationale for combination testing of PV-10. This development track, separate from the phase 3 study, using PV-10 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors could present a path forward for patients with significant disease burden not amenable to intralesional injection. 
 While we believe the rapid oncolytic effect immediately evident in patients treated with PV-10 highlights our path to initial approval, the bystander effect, or secondary immunomodulatory benefit of PV-10 as a result of direct ablation, continues to be of scientific interest and studies to quantify systemic tumor-specific immune response in cancer patients are ongoing. This is why we term the overall function of PV-10 as oncolytic immunotherapy. This emerging understanding of the secondary effect of tumor ablation with PV-10 is an important foundation for future studies to assess the long-term impact of PV-10 on distant metastasis and possible combination strategies for use of PV-10 in the treatment of cancer patients with more advanced disease. PV-10 is therefore becoming known as an oncolytic immunotherapy, and we believe it is therefore a next generation oncolytic immunological treatment. 
 As mentioned above, we are also engaged in studying the use of PV-10 as part of a combination therapy for melanoma for Stage IV patients. Scientifically, combination therapy in cancer treatment is a rapidly maturing area, where a rational combination of agents is replacing the empirical approaches of the past. In this specific instance, we have used insight into the PV-10 mechanism of action and focused pre-clinical testing to begin Phase 1b/2 clinical testing of PV-10 in combination with Mercks KEYTRUDA in patients with Stage IV melanoma. KEYTRUDA is an immune checkpoint inhibitor approved for treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma. The PV-10 mechanism of action studys clinical findings showed that the immunologic effect of tumor ablation with PV-10 may be complementary to immune checkpoint inhibition. Companion pre-clinical testing of PV-10 in murine models of melanoma also demonstrated that the respective therapeutic effects of PV-10 and immune checkpoint inhibition are increased when the two are used in combination. Put simply, they may work better together, especially for late stage patients. The current Phase 1b/2 study will help us prepare for potential marketing of PV-10 as part of a combination therapy with KEYTRUDA. When we announced the joint patent co-owned with Pfizer in August 2015, it specifically covered the use of PV-10 to treat melanoma and liver cancers in combination with systemic inhibitors of immune system down regulation, such as anti-CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies, along with enhancers of immune system up regulation, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma. In other words, our work with KEYTRUDA, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, is patent protected. 
 PV-10 represents both a unique opportunity and an incredible responsibility because it may have the potential to change the way cancer is treated around the world. PV-10 is a small molecule designed to be injected directly into tumors, thereby focusing its effect on disease tissue, while limiting exposure in healthy tissue. We believe that this focused effective tumors has the potential to educate the immune system to find other cancer cells with the same characteristics, thereby potentially having an effect on metastases elsewhere in the body. The work previously reported by our collaborators at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and at the University of Illinois at Chicago clearly indicate that this is taking place in laboratory models of multiple tumor types, including melanoma, breast carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. Additional information on how this can translate to patients was reported by the Moffitt team in November 2015 at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting in Washington; in April 2016 at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in New Orleans; and in May 2016 in the cancer journal Oncotarget.

We are analyzing data obtained from our Compassionate Use Program for PV-10 for non-visceral cancers, which was closed to new enrollment at the end of June, 2016. One hundred eighty seven patients, enrolled in centers across the U.S. and Australia, received PV-10 on a schedule that was more frequent and extensive, and covering a longer period of time, than was allowed under the protocol used for the phase 2 trials. Safety data obtained from this was very helpful with planning the phase 3 melanoma study as well as treating other types of cutaneous and subcutaneous cancers, and we are gratified we could provide PV-10 for patients that had no other available option. 
 We are continuing to assess how much additional work we should do by ourselves, and when to partner with a larger company to further co-develop PV-10, as well as potential paths to accelerated and expedited approval in the U.S. and abroad, including in China and India. 
 We strengthened our position in the Chinese market with our letter of intent with Boehringer Ingelheim (China) Investment Company Limited, signed July 2, 2015. We are benefiting from their 20 plus years of experience in China, and we are building a relationship with them that may help us in commercializing and marketing PV-10 in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as we work with the appropriate regulatory bodies. We are committed to being successful in China, in particular, and Asia in general. 
 Discussions have continued on the basis of a memorandum of understanding signed last year with Sinopharm-China State Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry, CSIPI, the leader among all pharmaceutical research institutes in China and Sinopharm A-Think Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Sinopharm A-Think, the only injectable anti-tumor drug research and development manufacturer and distribution integrated platform within Sinopharm Group. While our working arrangement is more developed with Boehringer, management of Provectus and senior personnel and Sinopharm, CSIPI, and Sinopharm A-Think has held numerous conference calls, have met face-to-face in both China and the U.S., and Chinese scientists on staff at Sinopharm have discussed in person PV-10 and its clinical results with various lead investigators we work with globally. Some more formal relationship with them remains an option for us in China, and will endeavor to include Boehringer as well in any future developments and potential partnerships. 
 Efforts have been active in Brazil as we work with potential partners there, and Latin America in general, as well as in India, as we continue our focus to enter into geographic license and our collaborations that allow us to generate meaningful clinical data more rapidly than otherwise. 
 We have signed agreements with two manufacturers to supply us with clinical-quality PV-10, and we now have sufficient quantities of PV-10 available to continue the phase 3 trial and our other PV-10 development activities. To assure smooth execution of the study we have lined up specialty contract research organizations (CROs) and other service providers with expertise in clinical operations and integrated data management. As is standard in our industry, this includes full-service, international CROs who will coordinate the global efforts of this team of specialists. 
 Our lead CRO is coordinating global safety monitoring (pharmacovigilance) appropriate for our growing global clinical operations, and establishment of an independent Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to provide independent oversight of our phase 3 melanoma study. The FDA states A clinical trial DMC is a group of individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating data from one or more ongoing clinical trials. The DMC advises the sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects and those yet to be recruited to the trial, as well as the continuing validity and scientific merit of the trial. The DMC will ensure that our study provides patients with maximum possible safety while protecting the scientific validity and integrity of the data we gather. 
 Liver Cancers 
 According to Global Cancer Facts & Figures, 3rd Edition, liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in men and the ninth in women. An estimated 782,500 new liver cancer cases occurred in the world during 2012, with China alone accounting for about 50% of the total. Rates are more than twice as high in men as in women. Liver cancer rates are the highest in Central America, West and Central Africa, and East and Southeast Asia (Figure 9). Most primary liver cancers occurring worldwide are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which likely accounts for 70% to 90% of cases. One type of liver cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) that is rare in most parts of the world has high incidence rates in Thailand and other parts of Asia due to the high prevalence of liver fluke infection. Worldwide, liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men and the sixth leading cause among women, with about 745,500 deaths in 2012.

Early detection is difficult and as a result, most cases reach an advanced metastatic stage and are unresectable. If the cancer cannot be completely removed, the disease is usually deadly within three to six months. Malignant lesions in the liver arising from HCC or metastases from a wide range of cancers represent an ongoing treatment challenge for oncologists. HCC is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, and its incidence is rapidly increasing in the United States. The liver is a common site of metastases from solid tumors, particularly those arising in the gastrointestinal tract. Other tumors, such as lung and breast cancer and melanoma, also readily spread to the liver. 
 During 2016, we expanded our exploratory phase 1 study of cancers of the liver to four centers (St. Lukes University Health Network, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; The Southeastern Center for Digestive Disorders & Pancreatic Cancer, Tampa, Florida; Sharp Memorial Hospital, San Diego, California; and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee), and we are evaluating the addition of several more centers to further advance this initial effort. We reported results from long-term follow-up of our initial patients in February 2017 at two international oncology conferences, one in the U.S. and the other in China. We are assessing strategies to accelerate advancement to phase 1b/2 testing, either alone or in combination with systemic therapy. Any combination studies in the liver are likely to follow similar development strategies to those outlined above for melanoma and rely on much of the same foundational science. 
 The current phase 1 study, initially designed solely to establish safety of percutaneous injection of PV-10 into liver tumors (that is, injection through the skin), is providing valuable data crucial for planning such advanced clinical development. This trial is open to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or other cancers metastatic to the liver who have at least one tumor that has either originated in or spread to the liver and are not candidates for surgery or transplant. All patients enrolled in this open-label study receive the same treatment: an interventional radiologist injects PV-10 percutaneously into a single liver tumor. Patients with multiple injectable tumors may later receive further PV-10 to their other tumors. We have received numerous inquiries about this study from researchers as well as patients and their doctors, and refer these to our investigators through the contact information available on the clinicaltrials.gov website. We plan to commence the phase 1b/2 liver study in early 2017. This study has potential for generating sufficient data to support expedited approval under one or more FDA programs. 
 In July 2015, data were presented at two conferences that show our progress to date on the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and cancers metastatic to the liver. We made a poster presentation at the ESMO 17th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer (ESMO GI) in Barcelona at the beginning of July, and detailed data from our relevant Phase 1 study of PV-10. The main conclusion was that preliminary evidence of efficacy in treatment of cancers of the liver with PV-10 was observed. That same week, Dr. Sanjiv Agarwala presented the data in poster form at the 6th Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert Meeting, APPLE 2015, in Osaka, Japan. Both of these posters can be found on our website. What these data show is that PV-10 affects cancers of the liver in much the same way it does melanoma. More work has to be done, but we believe that these results support advanced clinical development of PV-10 in one or more phase lb/2 studies referred to above. 
 In November 2016 at the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting in Washington, our collaborators at Moffitt Cancer Center reported preliminary data on combination of intralesional PV-10 with systemic gemcitabine, using murine models of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Gemcitabine is a standard chemotherapeutic agent used to treat pancreatic cancer, and the Moffitt team showed that PV-10 ablation of pancreatic cancer tumors led to immunologic activation comparable to that previous reported for melanoma, breast carcinoma and colorectal tumors. Addition of gemcitabine enhanced these effects of PV-10, possibly via suppression of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which decrease in response to gemcitabine. Since MDSC have an inhibitory effect on a number of immune effector cells, including CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells and NK T cells, the apparent combination effect could result from reduced immune suppression by gemcitabine coupled with immunologic stimulation by PV-10. According to statistics from the America Cancer Society, over 53,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected in the U.S. in 2016, with 41,780 deaths and a 5-year survival of 8%. What we have learned so far about percutaneous PV-10 injection into liver cancers could have applicability to an exploratory clinical study of this cancer where any progress is likely to be clinically meaningful. 
 Breast Cancer 
 According to Global Cancer Facts & Figures, 3rd Edition, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide with nearly 1.7 million new cases diagnosed in 2012, accounting for 25% of all new cancer cases in women. A little more than half (53%) of these cases occurred in economically developing countries, which represents about 82% of the world population. An estimated 521,900 breast cancer deaths occurred in women in 2012. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women in developing countries and the second leading cause of cancer death (following lung cancer) among women in developed countries. Asian countries, which represent 59% of the global population, have the largest burden of breast cancer, with 39% of new cases, 44% of deaths, and 37% of the worlds five-year survivors. Although Northern America (US and Canada) represents only 5% of the world 
 
7 
 
 population, it accounts for 15% of new cases, 9% of deaths, and 17% of survivors, reflecting the high incidence and survival rates in the region. In contrast, African countries (15% of world population) represent 8% of the total new cases, but 12% of breast cancer deaths because of poor survival due to late stage at diagnosis and limited treatment. 
 In 2005, we began a phase 1 study of PV-10 to assess the safety and tolerability of injections of PV-10 into recurrent breast carcinoma. We completed the phase 1 study in 2008. The primary outcome measure was systemic and locoregional adverse experience. The secondary outcome measures were (i) histopathologic response of PV-10 injected lesions and (ii) wound healing of PV-10 injected lesions. 
 The goals of the phase 1 clinical trial were to determine the safety of the treatment and the appropriate dosage. We have also wanted to show that PV-10 has multi-indication potential. We continued to demonstrate this objective in 2011 through 2015, and continued to do so in 2016. We are now in a position for a phase 2 study in recurrent breast carcinoma with our lead oncology drug product candidate PV-10. We are evaluating potential for further development of PV-10 to treat recurrent breast cancer based on the published data provided by Moffitt as well as interest to address this important indication. 
 Colon and Rectum Cancer 
 According to Global Cancer Facts & Figures, 3rd Edition Colon and Rectum, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second in women. Worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million cases of colorectal cancer occurred in 2012. The highest incidence rates were in Northern America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and South Korea. Rates were low in Africa and South Central Asia. About 693,900 deaths from colorectal cancer occurred in 2012 worldwide, accounting for 8% of all cancer deaths. The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing in certain countries where risk was historically low (e.g., Japan). 
 The greatest increases are in Asia (Japan, Kuwait, and Israel) and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia). In fact, incidence rates among males in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Japan have exceeded the peak rates observed in longstanding developed countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, and continue to increase. In high-risk/high-income countries, trends over the past 20 years have either gradually increased (Finland and Norway), stabilized (France and Australia), or declined (United States) with time. The decrease in colorectal cancer incidence in the United States among those 50 years of age and older partially reflects the increase in detection and removal of precancerous lesions through screening. In contrast to the stabilizing rates observed in most Western and Northern European countries, relatively large increases have been observed in Spain, which may be related to the increasing prevalence of obesity in recent years in that country. The increase in several Asian and Eastern European countries may also reflect increased prevalence of risk factors for colorectal cancer associated with westernization such as unhealthy diet, obesity, and smoking. In contrast to incidence trends, decreasing colorectal cancer mortality rates have been observed in a large number of countries worldwide and are most likely due to colorectal cancer screening and/or improved treatments. However, increases in mortality rates are still occurring in countries that have more limited resources, including Brazil and Chile in South America and Romania and Russia in Eastern Europe. 
 On February 2, 2015, data discussing the immunologic effects of PV-10 on colon cancer cells were presented at the 11th Annual Academic Surgical Congress in Jacksonville, Florida. The abstract, titled PV-10 Induces Potent Immunogenic Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells, was presented by N. M. Kunda of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. The research team is led by Dr. A.V. Maker, and co-authors in addition to Drs. Kunda and Maker are: J. Qin, G. Qiao also of UIC, Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery. The team of authors also includes B. Prabhakar of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Department of Microbiology & Immunology, College of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. Dr. Maker belongs to both Departments. 
 In the presentation, Dr. Kunda noted that in vitro testing of PV-10 on colon cancer (murine CT-26 cells) showed cytotoxicity consistent with immunogenic apoptosis. Further, he stated that the researchers observed cell arrest, apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. He concluded that these results are consistent with immunologic cell death caused by PV-10.
The work reported in Dr. Kundas presentation further expands our understanding of the mechanism of action of PV-10 as an oncolytic immunotherapy for solid tumors, and parallels immunologic signaling noted upon ablation of melanoma with PV-10.
Other Indications 
 The compassionate use program for PV-10, which was closed to new patient enrollment at the end of June, 2016, was available for cancer indications that do not involve treatment of visceral organs and were not subject to enrollment in ongoing clinical trials. These indications include certain breast cancers, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, certain head and neck cancers and melanoma. Compassionate use programs provide patients with access to experimental therapeutics prior to FDA approval.

The protocol for the compassionate use program allowed patients to receive PV-10 on a schedule that was more frequent and extensive, and covering a longer period of time, than was allowed under the protocol used for the phase 2 trial of PV-10. Safety data obtained helped define the dose regimen for the phase 3 study for melanoma. The majority of patients enrolled in the program were treated for melanoma (177), with ten other patients treated for other indications such as recurrent squamous cell carcinoma and refractory scalp sarcoma. 
 In December 2016 we signed a Master Research Agreement with the Pediatric Oncology Experiment Therapeutics Investigators Consortium (POETIC), a group of 10 top-tier academic medical centers developing new pediatric center therapies, focused on assessment of PV-10 as a potential treatment for childhood cancers. The agreement establishes a framework for collaborative pre-clinical research projects the Company may conduct with members of POETIC within the field of pediatric oncology. To date no data have been reported from this work. 
 Additionally, we are considering a clinical study of PV-10 for each of multiple other solid tumor indications. 
 Dermatology (PH-10)
Our prescription drug candidate PH-10 is an aqueous hydrogel formulation of Rose Bengal for topical administration to the skin. It is a novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent that interacts with ambient and other light sources. We believe PH-10 is appropriate to treat all indications that are described as inflammatory dermatoses. We are developing PH-10 for the treatment of cutaneous skin disorders, specifically psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and we believe that PH-10 may be successful in treating other skin diseases. We believe that PH-10 may offer a superior treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis because it selectively treats diseased tissue with negligible potential for side effects in healthy tissue. 
 We have been actively discussing licensing transactions with a number of potential out licensing partners for PH-10. We believe that our phase 2c trial of PH-10 for psoriasis will further solidify the commercial viability of PH-10 in these discussions. In August 2011, we completed follow-up of all phase 2c patients and communicated data of the study to both prospective partners as well as the public market in early 2012. In January 2015, we commenced a mechanism of action study of PH-10 to better characterize the unique immunologic signaling aspects along with PH-10 safety and efficacy. This study was completed in January 2016 and advanced immunologic profiling of clinical samples obtained is ongoing. 
 Psoriasis 
 Psoriasis is a common chronic disorder of the skin characterized by dry scaling patches, called plaques, for which current treatments are few and those that are available have potentially serious side effects. There is no known cure for the disease at this time. According to the National Institutes of Health, as many as 7.5 million Americans, or approximately 2.2 percent of the U.S. population, have psoriasis. The National Psoriasis Foundation reports that approximately 125 million people worldwide, 2 to 3 percent of the total population, have psoriasis. It also reports that total direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis for patients exceed $11 billion annually. 
 According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, the majority of psoriasis sufferers, those with mild to moderate cases, are treated with topical steroids that can have unpleasant side effects. None of the other treatments for moderate cases of psoriasis have proven completely effective. The 25-30% of psoriasis patients who suffer from more severe cases generally are treated with more intensive drug therapies or PUVA, a light-based therapy that combines the drug Psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A light. While PUVA is one of the more effective treatments, it increases a patients risk of skin cancer. 
 Our phase 1 study for PH-10 was initiated in April 2001 to evaluate the safety of three different doses of PH-10 in separate patient segment groups. Subjects in the study each received a single dose of PH-10 followed by administration of green light on psoriatic plaques. Subjects were examined post-treatment, with a final follow-up examination at 90 days. 
 Detailed phase 2 study of PH-10 for treatment of psoriasis was initiated in 2009 and completed in April 2010. There were 30 subjects treated in the completed phase 2 study, and an additional six subjects were treated in an earlier study that was terminated in favor of an increased dosing frequency. Consistent with the preliminary data that we announced in December 2009, 70% of the 30 subjects enrolled in the phase 2 clinical trial of PH-10 for psoriasis demonstrated improvement in their Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) scores at the end of four weeks of daily treatment with PH-10. In addition, 86% of subjects reported no or only mild pruritus (itching) by week four of the trial, and no significant safety issues were noted. At the four-week interval substantial improvement was observed across all standard disease assessment scores. 
 During 2010, we initiated a phase 2c clinical trial of PH-10 for psoriasis. This multicenter, randomized controlled phase 2c study enrolled 99 subjects at four different sites, which began in December 2010. The subjects were randomized sequentially by center to 
 
9 
 
 one of four treatment cohorts, and assessed efficacy and safety of topical PH-10 applied once daily to areas of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. The primary efficacy endpoint was treatment success, a static endpoint assessed at day 29 after initial PH-10 treatment and defined as 0 or 1 on all Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) components and 0 or 1 on the Plaque Response scale. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of adverse experiences, including pain and dermatologic/skin toxicity (incidence, severity, frequency, duration and causality). The secondary outcome measures were (i) Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) score changes at each visit from day 1 pre-treatment, (ii) Plaque Response score changes at each visit from day 1 pre-treatment, and (iii) Pruritus Self-Assessment score changes at each visit from day 1 pre-treatment.
The phase 2c trial was conducted at four sites in the U.S. including the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, Wake Research Associates in Raleigh, North Carolina, Dermatology Specialists in Oceanside, California, and International Dermatology Research in Miami, Florida. With over 90 subjects, this trial is the largest dermatological trial that we have conducted to date. 
 The results of this study helped define the parameters necessary for the design of a pivotal phase 3 trial, and it was an important milestone on the regulatory pathway leading towards commercialization. In addition, we have held discussions with a number of potential out licensing partners, and we believe this phase 2c trial has further solidified the commercial viability of PH-10 in these discussions. We have also continued important toxicology research and development from 2012 into 2016 to prepare for a phase 3 study and to support possible filing of a New Drug Application filing. 
 In December 2014, we announced commencement of a phase 2 study of the mechanism of action of PH-10 in psoriasis. The purpose of the trial was to study the safety and efficacy of PH-10, a 0.005% preparation of Rose Bengal, in the treatment of psoriasis. Officially titled, A Phase 2 Study of Cellular and Immunologic Changes in the Skin of Subjects Receiving PH-10 Aqueous Hydrogel to Plaque Psoriasis, total enrollment was up to 30 patients. Subjects applied PH-10 vehicle daily for 28 consecutive days followed by active PH-10 daily for 28 consecutive days to their plaque psoriasis areas on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms, soles, scalp, facial and intertriginous sites). Biopsies of one target plaque were collected at baseline (at least 7 days prior to first study treatment on Day 1) and at Days 29 and 64, with a 7-day interval between biopsy at Day 29 at the end of vehicle application and commencement of application of active PH-10 on Day 36. Study data from each subject serves as an internal control (i.e., with assessment at baseline and at the end of application of PH-10 vehicle) for evaluation of clinical and cellular response to active investigational agent. 
 The multicenter study was designed to assess treated psoriatic plaque for changes in immunologic, structural and hyperproliferative state and for any evidence of cellular atypia when treated with PH-10 and to correlate observed changes in the skin with clinical response to treatment. These assessments may advance the understanding of the mechanism of action of PH-10 in psoriasis and other inflammatory dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis, and further substantiate the safety profile of the agent. Biopsy specimens will be assessed for changes in epidermal hyperplasia (i.e., disordered condition of the skin creating thickening and scaling); infiltration with immune cells; and molecular markers of inflammation. Correlation of clinical response to these cellular and molecular changes will be performed at the plaque level using Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) assessment data. Safety will be assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration, severity and attribution of clinical adverse events; evaluating changes in laboratory values and vital signs; and by correlation of clinical adverse events with observed histopathologic and immunohistopathologic changes in the skin. 
 By capturing data at the clinical and cellular level, we expect this study to allow us to establish how PH-10 affects psoriatic plaque and other similar inflammatory diseases of the skin, and to relate the safety profile from earlier studies to such effects. We believe that understanding these effects with this level of detail will allow us to properly position PH-10 within the competitive landscape and should provide crucial safety data to support extended dosing. We expect this effort to provide a comparable level of understanding of the effects of PH-10 in diseased skin to the keen insight we have gained through our clinical and nonclinical mechanism studies of PV-10, our novel investigational cancer drug, in melanoma and other cancers. Because there are no good model systems for psoriasis, we believe this study affords a critical opportunity to link the clinical effects we have observed to changes in well-established immunologic drivers of the disease. The clinical portion of the study was performed at three centers in the United States. The first patient entered the study in January 2015, and the last patient completed clinical activities in December 2015. Preliminary analysis of biopsy specimens was completed in April 2016, and advanced immunologic profiling of clinical samples obtained is ongoing. This work is expected to be completed in early 2017. We will use data from this study to guide further development of PH-10 with our objective to co-develop or license PH-10 with dermatological partner as we continue to prepare to advance PH-10 for approval as topical anti-inflammatory non-steroidal agent for treating psoriasis and other inflammatory dermatoses. 
 Atopic Dermatitis 
 Atopic Dermatitis, the most severe and common type of eczema, is a long-term skin disease that causes dry and itchy skin, rashes on the face, inside the elbows, behind the knees, and on the hands and feet. Scratching of the afflicted skin can cause redness, swelling, 
 
10 
 
 cracking, weeping clear fluid, crusting, thick skin, and scaling. According to the National Eczema Association, physicians estimate that 65% of eczema patients are diagnosed in the first year of life and 90% of patients experience it before age five. Often the symptoms fade during childhood, though most will have atopic dermatitis for life. The National Eczema Association estimates that atopic dermatitis affects over 30 million Americans. 
 In 2008, we initiated a phase 2 study of PH-10 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. This phase 2 study assessed whether topical PH-10 applied once daily to mild, moderate or severe atopic dermatitis may ameliorate inflammation of the skin when activated by ambient light. The subjects applied PH-10 daily for 28 days to skin areas affected by atopic dermatitis. The subjects were assessed weekly during the treatment period and for four weeks following the treatment period. The primary outcome measures were (i) treatment success, defined as a score of 0 to 1 at day 28, the end of the study treatment period, by the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) scoring system for atopic dermatitis status, and (ii) adverse experience, including pain and dermatologic/skin toxicity (incidence, severity, frequency, duration and causality) during the eight weeks following treatment. 
 Data from the subjects indicated that a substantial majority of subjects had improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) during four weeks of treatment. The treatments were generally well tolerated with no significant safety issues identified. At the four-week interval substantial improvement was observed across all standard disease assessment scores. We have also continued important toxicity study research and development in 2012 through 2015 and thus far in 2016 to prepare for continued development in this indication and to support a New Drug Application filing. 
 Other Indications 
 We have investigated the use of PH-10 for treatment of actinic keratosis (also called solar keratosis or senile keratosis), which is the most common pre-cancerous skin lesion among fair-skinned people and is estimated to occur in over 50% of elderly fair-skinned persons living in sunny climates. We have previously conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of PH-10 for actinic keratosis to examine the safety profile of a single treatment using topical PH-10 with green light photoactivation. No significant safety concerns were identified in the study. We have decided to prioritize further clinical development of PH-10 for treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis rather than actinic keratosis at this time since the market is much larger for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. 
 We have also conducted pre-clinical studies of PH-10 for use in treating severe acne vulgaris. Moderate to severe forms of the disease have proven responsive to several photodynamic regimens, and we anticipate that PH-10 can be used as an advanced treatment for this disease. Our pre-clinical studies show that the active ingredient in PH-10 readily kills bacteria associated with acne. This finding, coupled with our clinical experience in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and actinic keratosis, suggests that therapy with PH-10 should exhibit no significant side effects and could afford improved performance relative to other therapeutic alternatives. If correct, this would be a major advance over currently available products for severe acne. 
 The active ingredient in PH-10 is photoactive in that it reacts to light of certain wavelengths thereby potentially increasing its therapeutic effects. We believe that photodynamic treatment regimens can deliver a higher therapeutic effect at lower dosages of active ingredient, thus minimizing potential side effects including damage to nearby healthy tissues. PH-10 is especially responsive to green light, which is strongly absorbed by the skin and thus only penetrates the body to a depth of about three to five millimeters. For this reason, in the past we have investigated PH-10 combined with green-light activation, for topical use in surface applications where serious damage could result if medicinal effects were to occur in deeper tissues. 
 Over-the-Counter Pharmaceuticals 
 We have designated our subsidiary that holds our OTC products, GloveAid and Pure-ific, Pure-Stick, Pure N Clear as non-core. The potential further development and licensure of our OTC products would likely be facilitated by selling a majority stake of the underlying assets of the non-core subsidiary holding the OTC products. This transaction would likely be accomplished through a non-core spin-out process, which would enable the non-core subsidiary to become a separate publicly held company. The new public entity could then raise funds without diluting the ownership of the then current stockholders of the Company, although there can be no assurance that this process will occur. 
 GloveAid 
 Personnel in many occupations and industries now use disposable gloves daily in the performance of their jobs, including airport security personnel, food handling and preparation personnel, health care workers such as hospital and blood bank personnel, laboratory researchers, police, fire and emergency response personnel, postal and package delivery handlers and sorters, and sanitation workers. 
 
11 
 
Accompanying the increased use of disposable gloves is a mounting incidence of chronic skin irritation. To address this market, we have developed GloveAid, a hand cream with both antiperspirant and antibacterial properties, to increase the comfort of users hands during and after the wearing of disposable gloves. During 2003, we ran a pilot scale run at the manufacturer of GloveAid. 
 Pure-ific 
 Our Pure-ific line of products includes two quick-drying sprays, Pure-ific and Pure-ific Kids, that immediately kill up to 99.9% of germs on skin and prevent regrowth for six hours. We have determined the effectiveness of Pure-ific based on our internal testing and testing performed by Paratus Laboratories H.B., an independent research lab. Pure-ific products help prevent the spread of germs and thus complement our other OTC products designed to treat irritated skin or skin conditions such as acne, eczema, dandruff and fungal infections. Our Pure-ific sprays have been designed with convenience in mind and are targeted towards mothers, travelers, and anyone concerned about the spread of sickness-causing germs. During 2003 and 2004, we identified and engaged sales and brokerage forces for Pure-ific. We emphasized getting sales in independent pharmacies and mass (chain stores) markets. The supply chain for Pure-ific was established with the ability to support large-scale sales and a starting inventory was manufactured and stored in a contract warehouse/fulfillment center. In addition, a website for Pure-ific was developed with the ability for supporting online sales of the antibacterial hand spray. During 2005 and 2006, most of our sales were generated from customers accessing our website for Pure-ific and making purchases online. We discontinued our proof-of-concept program in November 2006 and have, therefore, ceased selling our OTC products. We now intend to license the Pure-ific product, a strategy we have been discussing with interested groups. Additionally, we also intend to sell a majority stake in the underlying assets via a non-core spin-out transaction. 
 Acne 
 Our acne products Pure-Stick and Pure N Clear work by decreasing the production of fats, oils and sweat that create an environment conducive to unchecked growth of bacteria. Secondly, the products also act to reduce the number of bacteria already present. Pure-Stick and Pure N Clear represent new formulations of proven, safe ingredients that achieve both steps required to successfully treat acne. Since Pure-Stick and Pure N Clear are applied topically to affected areas there are no safety concerns with healthy skin. The unique combinations have allowed the Company to secure patent protection for these products. 
Medical Devices 
 We have non-core medical device technologies that we believe may address two major markets: 
 

 | cosmetic treatments, such as reduction of wrinkles and elimination of spider veins and other cosmetic blemishes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | therapeutic uses, including photoactivation of PH-10, other prescription drugs and non-surgical destruction of certain skin cancers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to further develop our non-core medical devices through partnerships with, or selling our assets to, third-party device manufacturers or, if appropriate opportunities arise, through acquisition of one or more device manufacturers. Additionally, we also intend to sell a majority stake in the underlying assets via a non-core spin-out transaction. 
 Laser-Based Treatment of Melanoma 
 We have conducted extensive research on ocular melanoma at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School) using a new laser treatment that may offer significant advantage over current treatment options. A single quick non-invasive treatment of ocular melanoma tumors in a rabbit model resulted in elimination of over 90% of tumors, and may afford significant advantage over invasive alternatives, such as surgical excision, enucleation, or radiotherapy implantation. Ocular melanoma is rare, with approximately 2,000 new cases annually in the U.S., but based on these results, we believe that a device for laser treatment of melanomas of the eye is nearly ready for human studies. We anticipate partnering with, or selling our assets to, a medical device manufacturer to bring it to market in reliance on a 510(k) notification. For more information about the 510(k) notification process, see Federal Regulation of Therapeutic Products below.

Research and Development 
 We continue to actively develop projects that are product-directed and are attempting to conserve available capital and achieve full capitalization of our company through equity and convertible debt offerings, generation of product revenues, and other means. All ongoing research and development activities are directed toward maximizing shareholder value and advancing our corporate objectives in conjunction with our OTC product licensure, our current product development and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio. 
 Research and development costs totaling $8,543,074 for 2016 included payroll of $589,790, consulting and contract labor of $6,355,102, lab supplies and pharmaceutical preparations of $70,465, legal of $330,684, insurance of $243,569, rent and utilities of $96,794, and depreciation and amortization expense of $684,234. Research and development costs totaling $11,379,689 for 2015 included payroll of $2,292,710, consulting and contract labor of $6,652,406, lab supplies and pharmaceutical preparations of $1,115,140, legal of $358,582, insurance of $189,358, rent and utilities of $87,208, and depreciation and amortization expense of $684,285. Research and development costs totaling $5,809,047 for 2014 included payroll of $1,395,321, consulting and contract labor of $2,355,780, lab supplies and pharmaceutical preparations of $790,653, legal of $384,061, insurance of $115,957, rent and utilities of $87,623, and depreciation and amortization expense of $679,652. 
 Production 
 We have determined that the most efficient use of our capital in further developing our OTC products is to license the products. We have been discussing this strategy with interested groups. Additionally, we also intend to sell a majority stake in the underlying assets via a non-core spin-out transaction. 
 Sales 
 We have not had any significant sales of any of our OTC products, though we commenced limited sales of Pure-ific, our antibacterial hand spray in 2004 through 2006, in a proof-of-concept program. We discontinued our proof-of-concept program in 2006 and have, therefore, ceased selling our OTC products. We will continue to seek additional markets for our products through existing distributorships that market and distribute medical products, ethical pharmaceuticals, and OTC products for the professional and consumer marketplaces through licensure, partnership and asset sale arrangements, and through potential merger and acquisition candidates. 
 In addition to developing products ourselves, we are negotiating actively with a number of potential licensees for several of our intellectual properties, including patents and related technologies. To date, we have not yet entered into any licensing agreements; however, we anticipate consummating one or more such licenses in the future. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Patents 
 We hold a number of U.S. patents covering the technologies we have developed and are continuing to develop for the production of prescription drugs, non-core technologies and OTC pharmaceuticals. All patents material to an understanding of the Company are included and a cross reference to a discussion that explains the patent technologies and products is identified for each patent in the following table:

We continue to pursue patent applications on numerous other developments we believe to be patentable. We consider our issued patents, our pending and patent applications, and any patentable inventions which we may develop to be extremely valuable assets of our business. 
 Material Transfer Agreement 
 We have entered into a Material Transfer Agreement dated as of July 31, 2003 with Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, which we refer to as SPAH, the animal-health subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corporation, a major international pharmaceutical company which is still in effect. Under the Material Transfer Agreement, we will provide SPAH with access to some of our patented technologies to permit SPAH to evaluate those technologies for use in animal-health applications. If SPAH determines that it can commercialize our technologies, then the Material Transfer Agreement obligates us and SPAH to enter into a license agreement providing for us to license those technologies to SPAH in exchange for progress payments upon the achievement of goals. 
 The Material Transfer Agreement covers four U.S. patents that cover biological material manufacturing technologies (i.e., biotech related). The Material Transfer Agreement continues indefinitely, unless SPAH terminates it by giving us notice or determines that it does not wish to secure from us a license for our technologies. The Material Transfer Agreement can also be terminated by either of us in the event the other party breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within 30 days of notice from the other party. We cannot assure you that SPAH will determine that it can commercialize our technologies or that the goals required for us to obtain progress payments from SPAH will be achieved. 
 We have received no progress payments in relation to our Material Transfer Agreement with SPAH. Progress payments could potentially total $50,000 for the first cell line for which SPAH uses our technology and $25,000 for each use of the same technology thereafter. We do not know how many cell lines SPAH may have and we currently have no indication from SPAH that it intends to use any of our technologies in the foreseeable future. 
 Additionally, we also intend to sell a majority stake in these underlying assets via a non-core spin-out transaction. 
 Competition 
 In general, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, characterized by rapid advances in products and technology. A number of companies have developed and continue to develop products that address the areas we have targeted. Some of these companies are major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are international in scope and very large in size, while others are niche players that may be less familiar but have been successful in one or more areas we are targeting. Existing or future pharmaceutical, device, or other competitors may develop products that accomplish similar functions to our technologies in ways that are less expensive, receive faster regulatory approval, or receive greater market acceptance than our products. Many of our competitors have been in existence for considerably longer than we have, have greater capital resources, broader internal structure for research, development, manufacturing and marketing, and are in many ways further along in their respective product cycles. 
 While it is possible that eventually we may compete directly with major pharmaceutical companies, we believe it is more likely that we will enter into joint development, marketing, or other licensure arrangements with such competitors. Eventually, we believe that we will be acquired. 
 We also have a number of market areas in common with traditional skincare cosmetics companies, but in contrast to these companies, our products are based on unique, proprietary formulations and approaches. For example, we are unaware of any products in our targeted OTC skincare markets that are similar to our Pure-ific product. Further, proprietary protection of our products may help limit or prevent market erosion until our patents expire. 
 Federal Regulation of Therapeutic Products 
 All of the prescription drugs we currently contemplate developing will require approval by the FDA prior to sales within the United States and by comparable foreign agencies prior to sales outside the United States. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements on the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. These agencies and other entities extensively regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our proposed products. While we attempt to minimize and avoid significant regulatory bars when formulating our products, some degree of regulation from these regulatory agencies is unavoidable. Some of the things we do to attempt to minimize and avoid significant regulatory bars include the following: 

 | Using chemicals and combinations already allowed by the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
15 
 

 | Using drugs that have been previously approved by the FDA and that have a long history of safe use; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Using chemical compounds with known safety profiles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 The regulatory process required by the FDA, through which our drug or device products must pass successfully before they may be marketed in the U.S., generally involves the following: 
 

 | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | Submission of an application that must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA approval to market a given product for a given indication after the appropriate application has been filed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For pharmaceutical products, pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Where appropriate (for example, for human disease indications for which there exist inadequate animal models), we will attempt to obtain preliminary data concerning safety and efficacy of proposed products using carefully designed human pilot studies. We will require sponsored work to be conducted in compliance with pertinent local and international regulatory requirements, including those providing for Institutional Review Board approval, national governing agency approval and patient informed consent, using protocols consistent with ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and other internationally recognized standards. We expect any pilot studies to be conducted outside the United States; but if any are conducted in the United States, they will comply with applicable FDA regulations. Data obtained through pilot studies will allow us to make more informed decisions concerning possible expansion into traditional FDA-regulated clinical trials. 
 If the FDA is satisfied with the results and data from pre-clinical tests, it will authorize human clinical trials. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap. Each of the three phases involves testing and study of specific aspects of the effects of the pharmaceutical on human subjects, including testing for safety, dosage tolerance, side effects, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical efficacy. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. These studies are closely monitored and may be conducted in patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. While the FDA can cause us to end clinical trials at any phase due to safety concerns, phase 1 clinical trials are primarily concerned with safety issues. We also attempt to obtain sufficient information about the drugs pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects during phase 1 clinical trial to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, phase 2 studies. 
 Phase 1 studies also evaluate drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and the mechanism of action in humans. These studies also determine which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. The total number of subjects included in phase 1 studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 
 Phase 2 clinical trials include the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving up to several hundred people. 
 Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained in phase 2, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug. Phase 3 studies also provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand people.

Applicable medical devices can be cleared for commercial distribution through a notification to the FDA under Section 510(k) of the applicable statute. The 510(k) notification must demonstrate to the FDA that the device is as safe and effective and substantially equivalent to a legally marketed or classified device that is currently in interstate commerce. Such devices may not require detailed testing. Certain high-risk devices that sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or that present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, are subject to a more comprehensive FDA approval process initiated by filing a premarket approval, also known as a PMA, application (for devices) or accelerated approval (for drugs). 
 We have established a core clinical development team and have been working with outside FDA consultants to assist us in developing product-specific development and approval strategies, preparing the required submittals, guiding us through the regulatory process, and providing input to the design and site selection of human clinical studies. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we may not obtain FDA approval on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA or the research institution conducting the trials may suspend clinical trials or may not permit trials to advance from one phase to another at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw a product approval if we do not comply with pertinent regulatory requirements and standards or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. If the FDA grants approval of a product, the approval may impose limitations, including limits on the indicated uses for which we may market a product. In addition, the FDA may require additional testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and/or effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Further, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including its withdrawal from the market. 
 Marketing our products abroad will require similar regulatory approvals by equivalent national authorities and is subject to similar risks. To expedite development, we may pursue some or all of our initial clinical testing and approval activities outside the United States, and in particular in those nations where our products may have substantial medical and commercial relevance. In some such cases, any resulting products may be brought to the U.S. after substantial offshore experience is gained. Accordingly, we intend to pursue any such development in a manner consistent with U.S. and International Council of Harmonisation (ICH) standards so that the resultant development data is maximally applicable for potential global approval. 
 OTC products are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar regulatory agencies, but the regulations relating to these products are much less stringent than those relating to prescription drugs and medical devices. The types of OTC products developed and previously sold by us only require that we follow cosmetic rules relating to labeling and the claims that we make about our product. The process for obtaining approval of prescription drugs with the FDA does not apply to the OTC products, which we have sold. The FDA can, however, require us to stop selling our product if we fail to comply with the rules applicable to our OTC products. 
 Management Changes 
 On December 27, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously voted to terminate Peter R. Culpepper, effective immediately, from all positions he held with the Company and each of its subsidiaries, including Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, for cause, in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement based on the results of the investigation conducted by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors regarding improper expense advances and reimbursements to Mr. Culpepper. The Board of Directors has previously established a search committee to identify a permanent Chief Executive Officer after Dr. Dees resignation effective February 27, 2016. In the interim, Timothy C. Scott, Ph.D., the Companys President, will perform the functions of the chief executive officer position in his capacity as President while the chief executive officer position remains vacant. 
Employees 
 We currently have two employees, both of whom are full-time employees, and an independent contractor, John R. Glass, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We also currently engage four full-time consultants, including a Director of Clinical Operations, a clinical data associate, a project manager, and an information technology consultant.
