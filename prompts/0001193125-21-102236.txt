Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a novel approach to immunotherapy designed to employ the bodys own T cells to generate a specific, potent and durable immune response that mimics natural biology. Our mission is to create therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer and other life-threatening immune-mediated diseases. Currently, we have two product candidates in human trials: NEXI-001 in acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and NEXI-002 in multiple myeloma, or MM. 
 The backbone of our approach is our proprietary Artificial Immune Modulation, or AIMTM, nanoparticle technology platform. The AIM technology enables us to construct nanoparticles that function as synthetic dendritic cells capable of directing a specific T cell-mediated immune response. Like natural dendritic cells, the AIM nanoparticles employ natural signaling proteins to deliver specific instructions to specific T cells directing a desired immune response. Importantly, unlike other cell therapy approaches, this is accomplished without any genetic manipulation of the T cell, thereby creating T cell products designed to maintain natural target identification, engagement and killing mechanisms. 
 By mimicking natural T cell biology, our T cell product candidates are designed to combine the attributes of cellular precision, potency and persistence with reduced potential for undesired toxicities. We believe this is a significant advantage of the AIM platform and our therapeutic product candidates compared to other T cell therapies. The following graphic summarizes the key features of the AIM platform. 
 


At the center of the immune response are T cells, often referred to as the foot soldiers of the immune system. Whenever healthy cells are under attack, either by a virus, bacteria or cancer, the immune system calls on the T cell to identify, engage and kill the specific invader or diseased cells. Importantly, natural T cells have the ability to distinguish between diseased and healthy cells. However, T cells need very specific sets of instructions to function effectively. In healthy individuals, these specific instructions are normally delivered to the T cells by dendritic cells, which are also referred to as professional antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells provide these instructions through key signaling proteins. However, cancer cells often compromise the function of dendritic cells and the instructions they deliver to T cells.

 Our AIM nanoparticle technology is designed to bypass the dendritic cells and deliver the right kind of instructions directly to T cells using natural biology. In essence, we create nano-sized synthetic dendritic cells. These nano-sized synthetic dendritic cells are designed to deliver precise instructions to a specific set of targeted T cells, and these instructions will be different depending on the therapeutic goal. Translating this to cancer, each infusion, or product, contains populations of T cells that can identify and attack multiple tumor-specific antigen targets on a tumor cell. In preclinical studies, we observed that AIM-activated T cells were potent, were able to effectively distinguish between tumor cells and healthy cells and showed potential for long term persistence. As the graphic below illustrates, our AIM nanoparticles emulate natural dendritic cells by delivering immune-specific instructions through two key humanized signaling proteins. 
 


Our two clinical stage product candidates, NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, are adoptive T cell therapies, or ACTs, that contain populations of naturally occurring CD8+ T cells that recognize a defined set of disease-relevant antigen targets. NEXI-001 is a donor-derived, or allogeneic, ACT in a Phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of patients with relapsed AML after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or allo-HSCT. NEXI-002 is a patient-derived, or autologous, ACT in a Phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of MM patients that have failed at least three prior lines of therapy. In December 2020, initial safety, tolerability and immunologic data from our NEXI-001 trial was shared as an oral presentation during the 62nd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. These preliminary data showed that single infusions of NEXI-001 T cells in the first three patients treated were well-tolerated. Initial indicators of immunologic response after NEXI-001 T cell infusion in each of the three patients were observed, including (i) lymphocyte reconstitution to pre-lymphodepletion baseline levels at timepoints early within the expected range, and an earlier-than-expected recovery of the CD4+ T cell compartment; (ii) the presence, proliferation and persistence of NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells as measured in peripheral blood; (iii) clonal expansion of NEXI-001 T cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow; and (iv) the persistence of less differentiated T cell subtypes in NEXI-001 product candidates over time, as measured in peripheral blood. It is important to note that we are early in the safety evaluation and dose-finding part of the Phase I/II trial, and that these results are derived from the first three patients only and are not statistically significant. We expect to announce data for most patients in both NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 clinical trials by the end of 2021. 
 Assuming successful final results from these Phase I/II clinical trials, we expect to discuss with the U.S. Federal Drug Administration, or the FDA, plans to progress both programs into registrational trials designed to support potential approval of both product candidates in the United States. In parallel, we plan to explore partnering opportunities for late-stage development and commercialization in these indications.

 The modular design of the AIM platform allows us to develop new product candidates for clinical evaluation across a range of other disease areas and indications. We plan to use new AIM nanoparticle constructs to develop new product candidates for additional blood tumor indications, and to expand our development efforts toward solid tumor indications. We are also developing new AIM nanoparticle constructs and modalities for potential clinical evaluation in new disease areas outside of oncology, including autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. 
 Our Pipeline 
 We are evaluating two product candidates in clinical trials, NEXI-001 in patients with AML and NEXI-002 in patients with MM. We are actively dosing patients in both Phase I/II trials and expect to complete enrollment for both trials in 2021, with initial data on most patients in both trials expected by the end of 2021. As Phase I/II trials, the trials consist of two parts. In the first part of the trials, the initial safety evaluation phase, we will assess the safety and tolerability of NEXI-001 or NEXI-002 T cells. In the second part of the trials, the expansion phase, we will further define safety and will also evaluate the initial efficacy of each product candidate at the dose and regimen established in the safety evaluation phase. We are currently in the safety evaluation phase of both trials. Based on analysis of initial data, we also anticipate filing with the FDA to request Breakthrough Therapy Designation and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation for both our NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 product candidates. 
 Our next adoptive cell therapy product candidate is planned to be positioned in solid tumors. We have observed in non-clinical studies the generation of melanoma-specific T cells from Stage III/IV melanoma patients as well as the activity and persistence of AIM ACT-generated T cells directed against the MART-1 antigen in melanoma tumor-bearing mice. We have also expanded HPV-specific T cells in vitro to support potential clinical evaluation in a variety of virally-mediated solid tumors. 
 In addition to our programs using the AIM ACT adoptive cell therapy modality, we are also developing a next-generation off-the-shelf injectable modality, which we refer to as AIM INJ. The AIM INJ modality is designed to enable AIM nanoparticles to engage CD8+ T cells directly inside the body without the need for ex vivo expansion and manufacturing, which we believe will result in a greater ease of administration and a less complex and less expensive manufacturing process. The key technical difference between the two modalities is the material used to manufacture the nanoparticle core: AIM ACT uses a superparamagnetic iron oxide-based nanoparticle core, or SPIO core, whereas each AIM INJ product incorporates a nanoparticle core made from bio-degradable polymers, polylactide-co-glycolide and polyethylene glycol, or PLGA-PEG. Importantly, the two modalities share the exact same signaling protein constructs and protein conjugation chemistry, which we believe will facilitate rapid development of new products.

 The following table summarizes our AIM pipeline. 
 


We have completed substantial non-clinical work to advance the AIM INJ modality towards a potential IND filing, including preparing appropriate IND-enabling experiments in support of a planned clinical program focusing on solid tumors. Subject to regulatory feedback and an IND filing, we anticipate a second clinical program that would target autoimmune disease and which would be the first AIM product candidate to suppress, rather than activate, T cell function. In support of this potential program, we have generated and published pre-clinical data in which we observed that AIM nanoparticles engaged and suppressed auto-reactive T cells. 
 Additionally, we are developing the AIM platform for potential clinical application in patients suffering from specific infectious disease. In non-clinical studies, we have been able to expand CD8+ T cells directed against viral antigens including Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Human Papillomavirus. Based on specific size and bio-distribution characteristics, the AIM INJ nanoparticles are designed to engage antigen-specific CD8+ T cell populations at multiple sites in vivo, such as the lymph node, lymphatic system, in the peripheral blood, tissue, or the tumor. Similar to AIM ACT nanoparticles, the AIM INJ nanoparticles are designed to mimic the core functions of dendritic cells by delivering two key immune-specific signals: (i) an antigen-specific recognition signal delivered by an HLA molecule loaded with an antigenic peptide (Signal 1), and (ii) a co-stimulatory signal to induce proliferation and expansion of the activated T cells (Signal 2). The only significant difference between the AIM ACT and AIM INJ modality is the nanoparticle core composition; the AIM INJ modality incorporates a biodegradable PLGA-PEG nanoparticle of approximately 100 nanometers in diameter, whereas the AIM ACT modality utilizes a SPIO core of similar size and shape. Importantly, both nanoparticle cores have similar design specifications and use the same chemistry to couple the same humanized signaling proteins. Both use the same antigen peptide loading process to complete the construct of the nanoparticle. 
 In initial in vitro experiments, we have observed that the AIM INJ nanoparticles are stable for at least six months, during which they maintain their functionality and specificity.

 Our Team and Corporate History 
 We were founded in 2011, with the exclusive licensing of the core AIM technology from The Johns Hopkins University, or Johns Hopkins. In 2017, attracted by the promise of this technology, Dr. Sol Barer, the co-founder and former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation, and the current Chairman of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., led the acquisition and recapitalization of our company. This recapitalization included significant investments from Dr. Barer, ArrowMark Partners and other experienced biotechnology investors. Dr. Barer currently serves as Chairman of our board of directors, and has recruited a management team whose members have decades of experience in the biotechnology industry. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Carmer, is a 35-year veteran of the industry, having played key roles in prior product development and commercialization efforts as a senior executive at MedImmune, LLC, Genentech, Inc., Amgen Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline plc. Kristi Jones, our Chief Operating Officer, brings over 30 years of leadership in product development, business and strategy roles at Genentech, MedImmune and AstraZeneca PLC. Dr. Jerome (Jerry) Zeldis, M.D., Ph.D., our Executive Vice President of Research & Development brings his experience as the former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer of Celgene Global Health. Our Chief Financial Officer, John Trainer, joined us after nearly 15 years in various senior financial, operational, strategic and transactional roles at MedImmune and AstraZeneca. Mathias Oelke, our scientific co-founder, transitioned from his faculty position with Johns Hopkins to his current position as our Senior Vice President for preclinical immune therapy and platform development. Our Chief Medical Officer, Bob Knight, has over 25 years of clinical development experience and joined us from Kite Pharmaceuticals, where he led the clinical development program for Yescarta®. 
 Our Approach 
 Our approach to immunotherapy employs the bodys own T cells and is designed to generate a specific, potent and durable immune response that mimics natural biology. We believe the key attributes of this platform are: 

 | Precision: Delivering specific sets of instructions to specific T cell populations that direct a specific T cell function;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potency: Direct T cells to attack multiple disease relevant antigen targets through naturally occurring identification, engagement and killing mechanisms, with reduced potential for undesired toxicities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Persistence: Maintain T cell sub-types that support self-renewal, proliferation, immunologic memory and long-term T cell survival.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Importantly, our AIM technology is used to select and amplify the antigen-specific function of naturally occurring T cells, and does not require or employ genetic engineering or genetic manipulation of T cells to accomplish this as a treatment strategy. This is a critical point of differentiation relative to most other targeted T cell therapies in development. 
 By utilizing natural T cells, the AIM technology is similar to other therapeutic approaches that are using naturally occurring, but unselected, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs. Current TIL therapies have generated impressive clinical responses in difficult-to-treat patient populations, including patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors like melanoma and cervical cancer. However, TIL products contain a significant range of variability from one product to another, including preferred ratios of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, optimal T cell phenotypes, and known T cell tumor-specificity. Given currently-employed TIL isolation and product manufacturing processes, it is not possible for current TIL therapies to control for any one of these important product attributes. Because our AIM technology uses synthetic dendritic cells designed to deliver specific instructions directly to specific populations of T cells, combined with a well-controlled manufacturing process, we believe we can produce product candidates with highly consistent in vitro characteristics that are associated with clinical responses: CD8+ T cells, T stem cell-like and memory subtypes, and antigen-specific recognition. We view this as a novel approach designed to deliver T cell therapies with pharmaceutical precision, and believe it represents an improved, more rational, more reproducible and more controllable process to consistently produce products with known anti-tumor properties when compared to other cellular approaches.

 Genetically engineered T cell approaches, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR Ts, or engineered T cell receptor, or TCR, technologies are very precise in their engineering, but have the key limitation of single antigen targeting, and have been associated with life-threatening side effects and limited durability. The manufacturing processes currently used for the in vitro activation and expansion of engineered T cell products results in T cell products that contain high proportions of terminally differentiated and exhausted T cell subtypes, with limited potential for in vivo persistence. 
 A theoretical advantage of engineered T cell products is enhanced anti-tumor potency, achieved through the transduction of high affinity and/or affinity-enhanced TCRs or through re-engineering the entire TCR complex. We have conducted in vitro experiments to compare the potency of both TCR-engineered and CAR T-transduced products with our AIM-activated T cell products. In tumor cell-line killing assays designed to assess the activity of our AIM-activated T cells with that of TCR and CAR T products, our AIM-activated T cells showed killing potency comparable to both genetically engineered modalities. 
 The chart below summarizes key differences that separate our technology from other cellular immunotherapy approaches. 
 


In addition to these core principles of differentiation, we believe the modular design of the AIM platform facilitates the rapid design of new product candidates based on synergies derived from interchangeable components, specifically antigen peptides, signaling proteins and core material, as well as shared methods for nanoparticle construction, protein conjugation, peptide loading, and a platform manufacturing system for T cell therapy products. Specifically, we can customize and load new sets of antigen targets and signaling proteins to efficiently create new products for new indications and new therapy areas. This will help us to grow our pipeline, either for development internally or via partnerships and collaborations. We intend to leverage these synergies to expand into additional cancer indications, including in solid tumors, and also into new disease areas like autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases, using both the AIM ACT and AIM INJ modalities, as appropriate. 
 Because our AIM-activated T cells maintain natural target identification, engagement and killing mechanisms, the AIM technology is HLA-restricted, meaning we must match the human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, allele subtype of a patient to that of the HLA protein on our AIM nanoparticle. For our current clinical trials, we are using the HLA-A*02:01, or HLA-A2, alleles, which is expressed in 40% to 45% of the U.S. 
 
8 


  population. The modular design of the AIM platform is designed to address this limitation going forward, and we are in the process of developing several other HLA alleles to accomplish this objective. We expect additional HLA alelles will include the following: HLA-A-1, HLA-A-11, HLA-A-24 and HLA-B7. Our plan is to introduce these new HLA alleles into future clinical programs, with a goal to increase access to the majority of the indicated patient populations. All amended or future studies will require regulatory approval. While we plan to develop other HLA alleles, based on current regulatory feedback, we do not believe that including additional HLA populations are required for regulatory approval or to qualify for priority or fast track designations in the United States. 
 The AIM platform is depicted in the graphic below, with our two clinical-stage product candidates shown utilizing HLA-A2 (Signal 1) in combination with anti-CD28 (Signal 2). In particular, the proteins shown as the potential Signal 2 (co-stimulatory) options can be used for applications in other disease areas, incorporating either the activation or suppression instructions required to achieve a desired therapeutic goal. 
 




Our AIM technology is designed to enable the development of T cell products that combine therapeutic precision, potency and persistence, and with reduced potential for unwanted toxicities. We believe this combination of attributes differentiates the AIM technology from other approaches to T cell therapy. Additionally, we believe the modular design of the AIM platform enables the opportunity for rapid product development in multiple therapeutic areas. We could choose to develop future products alone, or to pursue strategic partnerships through licensing or other collaboration agreements. We believe this approach presents several, and meaningful, opportunities to realize the promise of the AIM technology platform.

 Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to create therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer and other life-threatening immune-mediated diseases. We believe that in the long term, our AIM technology has the potential to be a core component of many immunotherapy combinations used to treat a variety of immune-mediated diseases. Our ultimate goal is to develop and bring to patients, independently or working with partners, a portfolio of off-the-shelf T cell products with specific application to a wide range of cancers, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. 
 Key elements of our strategy include: 
 

 | Advance NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 to registrational trials. Our initial focus is on developing therapies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies where there are existing clinical and regulatory precedents as well as a broad clinical and preclinical dataset for comparison of risk/benefit effectiveness. Our first two product candidates, NEXI-001 for patients with AML and NEXI-002 for patients with MM, are both targeted at diseases with a successful history of cell therapy research, late-stage clinical development and product registration by others. We believe this will facilitate our ability to understand the performance of our product candidates relative to other products targeting similar patient populations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand AIM ACT into solid tumors. We are expanding our pipeline into solid tumor indications. We expect our first product candidate targeting solid tumors to use a non-proprietary set of antigen peptides commonly over-expressed on a set of solid tumors, based on our existing preclinical work in solid tumor models. Given the large number of potential antigen combinations in solid tumors, we expect licensing and partnerships to be a core element of our strategy as we establish the broader applicability of our AIM technology.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Accelerate development of our AIM INJ modality. We believe that one of the most significant advantages presented by our AIM technology is the potential for an injectable form of the AIM nanoparticle. We expect that a key step in developing this technology will be to leverage experience and insight from our AIM ACT tumor product candidates into an injectable modality, which would be available as an off-the-shelf immunotherapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage partnerships to drive new product development in autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. The AIM INJ modality will be constructed to deliver either suppressive or apoptotic co-stimulation signals directly to auto-reactive T cell populations, which is critical for addressing autoimmune disorders. In addition to autoimmune disorders, we believe that there may be significant opportunities to address virally-mediated infectious diseases via either the AIM ACT or AIM INJ modality. We also believe that the AIM technology may be applicable to the treatment of, and preparation for, future virally-mediated epidemics and pandemics. While we believe that our AIM technology platform is well-suited to address these new therapeutic opportunities, we expect that we would partner with experienced biopharmaceutical companies with deep capabilities in these areas to advance new therapies in these potential indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While we intend to establish our own internal capabilities to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we will also explore strategic collaborations or partnerships that may accelerate our development timelines, broaden the therapeutic reach of our AIM technology platforms and maximize the full potential of both the AIM ACT and AIM INJ modalities. 
 Our AIM Technology Platform 
 Our AIM technology platform, which consists of AIM nanoparticles and our proprietary manufacturing process, represents a novel approach with the potential to deliver cell therapy with pharmaceutical precision. 
 
10 


 The AIM technology was originally developed in Professor Jonathan Schnecks Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy Laboratory at Johns Hopkins. We exclusively licensed the rights to the technology from Johns Hopkins in 2011 and have been further developing and refining the platform since that time. 
 The AIM Nanoparticle 
 The backbone of the AIM technology is the AIM nanoparticle, or np, which is comprised of a core nano-sized bead onto which specific humanized signaling proteins are conjugated. As illustrated by the below graphic, the AIM nanoparticle acts as a synthetic dendritic cell, delivering specific instructions to specific sets of T cells that direct a specific T cell function. 
 


The nanoparticle core. The AIM nanoparticle core is constructed from one of two unique materials depending on the modality. The AIM ACT modality uses a SPIO core to produce the AIM adoptive T cell therapy. The AIM INJ modality uses a biocompatible PLGA-PEG core. These core materials are used by other companies for other clinical applications as well as in FDA-approved products. 
 The signaling proteins. For both the AIM ACT and AIM INJ modalities, two specific humanized proteins are conjugated to the core nanoparticle to create the AIM nanoparticles. These AIM nanoparticles have been designed to mimic the core functions of healthy dendritic cells by engaging the two key signaling receptors on CD8+ T cells, which are referred to as Signal 1 and Signal 2. Signal 1, the antigen presentation signal, is delivered by a human HLA fusion protein, which is subsequently loaded with antigenic peptides of interest. Signal 2, the co-stimulatory signal, provides specific activation or suppression instructions either to induce proliferation and expansion of the activated cytotoxic T cells or to suppress or kill the auto-reactive T cells. In the case of NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, Signal 1 is a fully human HLA-A*02:01 hinge dimer and Signal 2 is a humanized anti-CD28 antibody. The anti-CD28 antibody engages the CD28 receptor on T cells, which is a known activation signal for naïve and memory T cells. The AIM nanoparticles have been designed to optimize the ratio and density of both signaling proteins regardless of which modality is employed. 
 The AIM peptide-loaded nanoparticle. The HLA molecules on each nanoparticle are loaded with one of the selected disease relevant antigen peptides. For our oncology-focused product candidates, Signal 1 antigen peptides are selected based on the following criteria: 
 

 | evidence from published literature of over-expression of the selected antigen peptide on both tumor cells and tumor stem cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | demonstration that the selected antigen peptides elicit an immunologic response from CD8+ T cells;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | evidence that the selected antigen peptides are critical to maintain an oncogenic phenotype, for example that the antigens play a critical role in tumor cell survival;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | evidence from published literature to support that the antigen peptides selected generate both an immunologic and clinical response in the indicated patient population; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 


 
 | evidence of target-specific activity and lack of allo-reactivity, with no overlap in expression on normal human tissues, as confirmed by in silico and in vitro experiments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To produce our NEXI product candidates, aliquots of individually loaded AIM nanoparticles are combined to create the final mix of peptide-loaded nanoparticles selected for each indication. This mix of nanoparticles are used to produce T cells capable of targeting multiple tumor-relevant antigens regardless of modality, whether AIM ACT or AIM INJ. In NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, we are targeting five antigen peptides simultaneously. However, we have successfully tested higher numbers of antigen peptides in pre-clinical studies and may choose to include more than five peptide targets in future NEXI product candidates. 
 The graphic below illustrates how AIM nanoparticles have been designed to deliver precise instructions to T cells via natural signaling mechanisms that mimic healthy dendritic cell function. The core nanoparticles are decorated with two specific immune signaling proteins that imitate cell-cell interactions with targeted T cells. The T cells accept instructions as if delivered from a healthy dendritic cell. The AIM nanoparticles coat the T cells of interest, which are those antigen receptors specific to our peptide loaded AIM nanoparticles and expressing CD28 on their surface. 
 


We are using the AIM technology platform to identify, activate and expand tumor antigen-specific T cells ex vivo using AIM ACT and in vivo using AIM INJ. The following graphic illustrates these two modalities. 
 



12 


 AIM ACT Modality 
 Our AIM ACT product candidates are produced using our AIM ACT nanoparticles combined with our proprietary manufacturing process, which utilizes our enrichment and expansion, or E+E, system. AIM ACT delivers T cell products with consistent composition and quality, each containing high proportions of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that maintain T cell subtypes that support anti-tumor potency, self-renewal, immunologic memory and long-term persistence. 
 As a first step in the E+E system, CD8+ T cells are isolated from other peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs. Aliquots of individual antigen peptide-loaded AIM nanoparticles are then introduced into culture with the CD8+ T cells and run through a magnetic column. The magnetic properties of the SPIO core enable the magnetic field to separate, or enrich, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from those that are not specific to the antigen peptides of interest. The enriched culture is transferred to an expansion chamber where we introduce a proprietary blend of cytokines and growth factors to drive the expansion of antigen-specific T cell populations over a 14-day period. After the T cells are harvested, the solution is washed to remove the AIM nanoparticles and free proteins, transferred into an infusion bag, frozen and shipped to each respective patient treatment facility, where the final product is then thawed and infused into the patient. The entire E+E manufacturing process takes 14 days from start to finish. See  Manufacturing below for more information with respect to our manufacturing process. The graphic below summarizes the process of harvesting T cells, enriching and expanding the T cells, and infusing the T cell product. 
 


AIM ACT T cell Characterization 
 The following in vitro data characterize the AIM ACT T cells expanded through our E+E system and evidence the ability of the AIM platform to consistently produce high quality T cells with a powerful combination of anti-tumor attributes. The experiments highlighted below were conducted using T cells equivalent to NEXI-001.
Precision: In non-clinical studies, AIM nanoparticles have delivered precise activation and proliferation signals directly to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. The AIM-expanded AML antigen specific T cells recognized and attacked multiple AML antigen targets on both leukemic tumor blasts and leukemic stem cells. To evaluate the precision of our products, we have conducted a number of ex vivo studies. In these studies, we use multimer staining of blood product that has been processed through our E+E system to identify CD8+ T cells that are specific to the antigens of interest. The results of one of these tests are below. The first five graphs each show a different antigen of interest, with the sixth graph showing a negative control. On each graph, the number of CD8+ T cells is plotted on the x-axis and the antigen specificity is plotted on the y-axis. The cells highlighted in 
 
13 


  the upper-right box are the cells with the desired specificity. In this example, 38% of the CD8+ T cells were specific to one or more of the antigens of interest. 
 


The example above is representative of our results across multiple product runs. In our experience, when the E+E system is used for the NEXI-001 product, it can consistently deliver total antigen specificity ranging from around 35% to 45%. 
 Potency: In non-clinical studies, AIM-expanded T cells have exhibited ex vivo killing potency that is comparable to genetically modified T cells, while effectively distinguishing healthy cells from tumor cells, which resulted in target-specific killing. In contrast to genetically modified T cells, which rely on artificial or high-affinity T Cell Receptor, or TCR, interactions for target recognition, engagement and killing, our AIM T cells consist of non-engineered T cells with a broad range of naturally occurring TCR affinities. As an endogenous T cell product, these T cells have undergone the bodys natural process of central tolerance and rely on the natural mechanism of functional avidity for target recognition, engagement and killing. As such, overexpression of a specific antigen target is required for cellular recognition, active engagement and elimination. 
 The two graphs below show a non-clinical comparison of the tumor cell killing activity of WT-1 transduced CD8+ T cells on the left and AIM-expanded CD8+ T cells on the right. The first graph is derived from data published from a study sponsored by Juno Therapeutics, Inc., now part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. The data shown quantifies the potency of TCRC4, a WT-1126 TCR-transduced CD8+ T cell product, against three independent HLA A2+ primary leukemia blast cell targets and one HLA A2- primary leukemia blast cell target (characterized by staining for CD45, CD34, CD38, CD117, CD15, CD90, CD96, CD123 and HLA-DR and quantified with flow count beads) at effector-to-leukemia cell (target) ratios of 10-to-1, 5-to-1, 2-to-1 and 1-to-1. These experiments resulted in tumor cell lysis between 60% and 70% at effector-to-target ratios comparable to those used in the AIM-expanded T cell experiments. The second graph quantifies the killing potency of AIM-expanded CD8+ T cells when cultured with a tumor cell line that expresses the antigens targeted by the AIM CD8+ T cells. In this experiment, our AIM-expanded T cells are tested for killing potency against the HLA A2+ U266 tumor cell line. Healthy human PBMCs were incorporated as negative controls, and used to analyze target specific killing and potential off-target toxicity. A secondary HLA-A2- tumor cell line, K562, was also used to further assess target-specific killing. As mentioned, all cell lines included were demonstrated to express some or all of the NEXI-001 targeted antigens as measured by Q-RTPCR, but only the U266 tumor cell line presented the targeted peptides in the context of HLA-A2, similar to the primary leukemia blast cell targets. 
 These two models are not identical and these results are not head-to-head comparisons. While both experiments incubated the effector CD8+ T cells with the target cells of interest and used the same effector-to-target ratios and the same fluorescent dye staining to identify target cells for analysis, there are two key differences between the models. First, the Juno experiments used primary leukemia blast cells, whereas the AIM-expanded T cell experiments used tumor cells lines. Second, the Juno experiments determined the absolute number of leukemia cells at timepoint 0 and after 18 hours, and calculated the percentage killing by the difference between those two numbers, while we determined the killing percentage by quantifying the caspase-positive target cells, which is an early indicator of cell death, at timepoints 0 and 4 hours and compared the two values. Although these models are not identical and these results are not a head-to-head comparison of cell 
 
14 


  therapy products, the results do show that at effector T cell-to-tumor cell ratios of 10-to-1 and 5-to-1, the potency of the AIM-expanded T cells was in a similar range to the data published by Juno. Importantly, no killing of the healthy blood cells by the AIM-expanded T cells was observed. The AIM-expanded T cells appear to have effectively identified, engaged and killed tumor cells without exhibiting any activity against healthy cells, all of which expressed the NEXI-001 target antigens at normal levels. 
 


Persistence: The AIM technology platform has been optimized to produce T cell product candidates that contain T cell subtypes that support long-term immunologic memory and survival. These subtypes include T stem cell-like memory, or Tscm, cells, which have self-renewal capabilities; T central memory, or Tcm, cells, which support T cell proliferation and immunologic memory; and T effector memory, or Tem, cells, which contribute effector functions required for tumor cell killing. The final T cell products also have very low populations of less desired subtypes such as terminally differentiated effector memory, or Temra, cells, which are terminally differentiated cells that persist for days or weeks only; and T naïve, or Tn, cells which have allo-reactive potential. 
 In order to confirm that AIM-expanded T cells contain these important subtypes, we conducted studies in which the cells were stained with specific antibodies, anti-CD45RA and anti-CD62L, which will stain different T cell phenotypes differently, and analyzed before and after the AIM manufacturing expansion process using fluorescence activated cell sorting. The data in the plot charts below show the differences in proportions of these subtypes at Day 0 of the E+E process and at the Day 14 harvest using healthy donor blood. Desired subtypes are highlighted in the red boxes, and contain the Tscm and Tcm cell populations, which represent the younger, more fit and less-differentiated T cells, while the T cells in the lower left and right quadrants, the Tem and Temra cells, represent more differentiated and exhausted subtypes. The data show how the E+E process results in a much different mix of T cell subtypes. While the majority of T cells at Day 0 are more differentiated subtypes (Tem and Temra), at Day 14 the majority of T cells are the desired subtypes (Tscm, distinguished from Tn cells by an extra staining step using CD95, and Tcm), and the proportion of Tn cells has been significantly reduced to almost negligible levels. 
 
15 


 The bar graph below to the right shows the consistency of these results across four E+E runs. The mean proportion of the desirable Tscm and Tcm cells was 67% and the proportion of Tscm, Tcm and Tem cells was 98%, with only 2% of Temra cells. We have optimized the E+E system to deliver these key T cell subtypes in every AIM-expanded T cell product, and to produce similar results when using peripheral blood from either healthy donors or patients. 
 


Mimicking a Natural T Cell Response 
 AIM-expanded T cells are designed to drive a natural immune response by maintaining natural target recognition, engagement, activation and killing mechanisms. This is accomplished by using endogenous, or non-engineered, T cells, which maintain a natural range of TCR affinities, including those with both high and low avidity. We believe that these combined attributes may deliver potent killing without the off-tissue and off-target toxicities seen with engineered cell therapies. Importantly, the expanded T cells maintain these attributes regardless of PBMC source, expanding T cells of similar potency and quality from either healthy donors or patients. 
 To demonstrate that AIM-expanded T cells maintain these attributes regardless of the blood source, whether patient or donor, we transferred our technology to a third-party research group for a series of non-clinical studies. This research group compared the clonotypes and Vß levels, which are two different measures of TCR diversity of T cell receptors in four healthy donors and four patients with stage 3 and stage 4 melanoma. As the graphic below shows, the number and patterns represented by the colors (each color representing one TCR) are similar for both the healthy donor and melanoma patient groups, which indicates that the TCR repertoires were similar between groups in terms of breadth and depth. 
 
16 


 

We believe that our AIM ACT product candidates offer a unique combination of attributes that, when combined, have the potential to address many of the current limitations of other cell therapy approaches. This system has been optimized to be highly controllable and to enable the consistent and reproducible manufacturing of T cell product candidates with the potential to combine cellular precision, potency and persistence while reducing the potential for undesired toxicities. The graphic below illustrates how the key features of our AIM technology deliver differentiated cell therapy products. 
 


AIM INJ Modality 
 We are developing AIM INJ nanoparticles as an injectable modality. Based on specific size and bio-distribution characteristics, the AIM INJ nanoparticles are designed to engage tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cell populations at multiple sites in vivo, such as the lymph node, lymphatic system, in the peripheral blood, or the tumor. Similar to the AIM ACT nanoparticle, the AIM INJ nanoparticles are designed to mimic the core functions of dendritic cells, by delivering the same two key immune-specific signals: (i) an antigen-specific recognition signal delivered by an HLA molecule loaded with an antigenic peptide (Signal 1), and (ii) a co-stimulatory signal to induce proliferation and expansion of the activated T cells (Signal 2). The only 
 
17 


  significant difference between AIM ACT and AIM INJ is the nanoparticle core composition; the AIM INJ modality incorporates a biodegradable PLGA-PEG nanoparticle of approximately 100 nanometers in diameter, whereas the AIM ACT modality utilizes a SPIO core of similar size and shape. Importantly, both nanoparticle cores have similar design specifications and use the same chemistry to couple the same humanized signaling proteins, which then use the same antigen peptide loading process to complete the construct of the nanoparticle. 
 The AIM INJ nanoparticles have the following specifications: they are ~100nm diameter in size with minimal size distribution reflected by a polydispersity index (PDI) of of <0.2, their surface charge is between 0 and -10mV, a conjugated Signal 1 to Signal 2 protein ratio of 1:1, and a protein molecule surface density between 100 and 500 molecules per nanoparticle. Initial in vitro experiments have shown the AIM INJ nanoparticles to be stable for at least 6 months during which they maintain their functionality and specificity. 
 To evaluate and confirm the potency and specificity of AIM INJ nanoparticles, we have performed in vitro T cell cultures, which compared the AIM INJ nanoparticle capability to expand antigen-specific T cells to that of the AIM ACT nanoparticles. Both AIM ACT and AIM INJ nanoparticles used identical versions of Signal 1 and Signal 2 proteins. The graphics below show the outcome of these cultures. The first column shows that both AIM ACT and AIM INJ nanoparticles stimulate a similar general CD8+ T cell population. In the second and third columns, we used multimer staining to identify CD8+ T cells that are specific to the antigens of interest. On each graph, the number of CD8+ T cells is plotted on the x-axis and the antigen specificity is plotted on the y-axis. The second column shows that when the T cells against the specific antigens were identified (in this case against a cytomegalovirus, or CMV), both modalities were similarly successful. The last column shows a negative control. 
 



18 


 Additionally, we tested the phenotypes of the T cells generated by both modalities in anti-CD62L / anti-CD45RA staining assay similar to that described earlier for AIM ACT. Again, the phenotypes generated by the two modalities were substantially the same. 
 


In vivo proof of concept data for the AIM INJ modality were generated by a third-party team of researchers using prototype AIM INJ nanoparticles. In a study by these researchers using a mouse melanoma lung metastasis model, direct injection of AIM nanoparticles into mice activated and expanded low-affinity T cells, which led to complete tumor eradication, while control mice developed more than 200 lung metastases. 
 In another study conducted by third-party researchers using a mouse melanoma model, mice were subcutaneously injected with B16-F10, a very aggressive mouse melanoma cell line. Three days after tumor cells were injected, mice were treated with (i) placebo injections, (ii) melanoma TRP-2 peptide loaded AIM nanoparticles, or (iii) a combination of AIM nanoparticles and the checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD1. The graphic below shows the outcome of this study. In this case, the researchers extracted lymphocytes from the tumors and then used both a control staining (top row) and a TRP-2-specific staining (bottom row) to determine the presence of antigen-specific T cells in the tumor. T cells that are found in a tumor are called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs. The x-axis on each of the graphs below measures the presence of CD8+ T cells, while the y-axis measures antigen specificity. Cells that are in the upper right quadrant are TILs against the desired antigens. As shown below, placebo injections did not result in TIL formation, whereas AIM nanoparticles induced significant numbers of melanoma-specific TILs. This effect was further enhanced when anti-PD1 and AIM nanoparticles were combined. This effect is particularly significant because the scientific literature suggests that anti-PD1 alone does not lead to TIL formation in this model. 
 
19 


 

We believe these nonclinical data provide evidence that AIM INJ nanoparticles have the potential to identify, engage and expand their targeted T cell populations to elicit a potent anti-tumor response. 
 Our Clinical-Stage Product Candidates 
 We have two programs in clinical trials: NEXI-001 for AML patients and NEXI-002 for MM patients. 
 NEXI-001
Our lead program, NEXI-001, is an allogeneic cell therapy in Phase I/II development for the treatment of patients with AML who have relapsed disease after receiving allo-HSCT. Allo-HSCT is currently the only therapeutic procedure with established curative potential for intermediate and high risk AML patients. However, of the approximately 20,000 patients diagnosed with AML in the United States in 2019, approximately 50% were young or healthy enough to qualify for allo-HSCT. Of those patients who do receive allo-HSCT, fewer than half are cured. Patients who relapse after allo-HSCT face a dismal prognosis and are left with very limited treatment options. Most will succumb to their disease within one year of relapse. 
 Treatment Paradigm for AML 
 While there are currently no approved therapies for this relapsed patient population, donor lymphocyte infusion, or DLI, is employed as the standard-of-care treatment. DLI is a procedure in which non-selected and non-disease specific T cells are collected from an AML patients original stem cell donor by apheresis. The T cells are then infused directly into the AML patient with the hope that some populations of the infused T cells will recognize and kill the patients leukemia cells, directing a graft versus leukemia, or GvL, effect. Unfortunately, this blunt approach works in only approximately 15% to 20% of patients. Making matters worse, approximately 50% to 60% of patients that receive DLI therapy experience life-threatening toxicities associated with non-leukemia specific T cells from the donor attacking healthy cells in the patient, a condition referred to as Graft Versus Host Disease, or GvHD. Currently, there is no way for a treating physician 
 
20 


  to de-couple the benefits of GvL from the toxicities of GvHD. They are not able to separate the good T cells from the bad. Because each NEXI-001 infusion contains high proportions of T cells that are directed to specifically recognize and attack only a patients leukemia cells and are comprised of very few T cell subtypes capable of eliciting a GvHD response, we believe therapy with NEXI-001 offers the potential to enhance the benefits of GvL while significantly reducing the risk of GvHD. 
 Our AIM technology is used to produce the NEXI-001 product candidate. As illustrated in the graphic below, AIM nanoparticles are loaded with AML-specific peptides from the WT 1, PRAME and Cyclin A1 antigens, which are used to enrich and expand AML-specific T cells. These AML-specific T cells recognize and attack these specific antigen peptide targets, which are commonly over-expressed on both leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells. 
 


The T cells in NEXI-001 are designed to be highly potent and highly selective in their ability to distinguish leukemia cells from healthy cells, and to contain key T cell subtypes that promote immunologic memory and long-term T cell persistence. We believe this combination of attributes has the potential to deliver deep and durable clinical responses for these AML patients. 
 Phase I/II Clinical Trial Design 
 Our ongoing clinical trial with NEXI-001 is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating Phase I/II trial that aims to enroll between 22 and 26 patients. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-001 T cells in patients with AML who have either minimum residual disease, or MRD, or morphologically detectable disease after an HLA-matched allo-HSCT. Secondary objectives include signals of immunologic responses and preliminary anti-tumor activity, including evaluations of the following clinical endpoints: overall response rate, or ORR, which includes complete response, or CR, progression free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. Additional analysis will assess the in vivo persistence, proliferation, functionality and TCR repertoire of NEXI-001 T cells as measured in blood and bone marrow samples. Our clinical endpoints have been recognized as appropriate measurements of safety and clinical response. 
 
21 


 This trial consists of two parts. The initial safety evaluation phase assesses the safety of two different NEXI-001 dosing regimens: a single infusion; and two infusions spaced a month apart from each other. An amendment is being filed to treat patients with a third dosing regimen: two cycles of three weekly infusions in a four week cycle. In the second part of the trial, the dose expansion phase, investigators further characterize safety and will also evaluate the initial activity of NEXI-001 T cells at the dose and interval established in the safety evaluation phase. We are currently in the safety evaluation phase of the trial. The City of Hope Cancer Center is the lead clinical site for this trial, with additional trial sites at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Karmanos Cancer Institute, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Advent Hospital in Orlando, Florida. 
 


Preliminary Data from the Phase I/II Clinical Trial 
 In February 2021, we reported that we have treated five patients across both Dose Level 1 and Dose Level 2 safety cohorts with a median follow-up of 5 months. Each of these patients has been closely monitored for safety and early signs of toxicity. In addition, biomarkers were analyzed to assess early signs of immunologic response; clinical lab reports and patient charts were used to measure myeloid activity (neutrophils counts, platelet counts, Red Blood Cell counts, lymphocyte counts); and validated clinical endpoints were incorporated to measure early signs of clinical activity. It is important to note that we are early in the safety evaluation and dose-finding part of the Phase I/II trial, and that the results reported here represent data from the first five patients only and are not statistically significant. 
 Safety and tolerability. As reported in February 2021, with a median follow-up of five months, there had been no treatment-related significant adverse events, or SAEs, or treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, observed after a single infusion of NEXI-001 T cells at doses of 50M, 100M and 200M total T cells. This includes no cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or ICANS, or infusion-related reactions, or IRRs at any Grade Level (Grade 1-4) at those (per protocol) dose levels. 
 Immunological responses. As reported in February 2021, for each of the first five patients, treated we have observed initial indicators of immunologic response after a single infusion of NEXI-001 T cells, including (i) early lymphocyte reconstitution to baseline levels after administration of lymphodepleting therapy with rapid and robust recovery of the CD4+ T cell compartment; (ii) the presence, proliferation and persistence of NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells as measured by multimer-staining of peripheral blood when adequate samples were available for analysis; (iii) clonal expansion and persistence of NEXI-001 T cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow as measured by TCR sequencing when adequate samples were available for analysis; and (iv) the presence of T cell subtypes that support anti-tumor activity, T cell proliferation, self-renewal and long-term persistence as measured 
 
22 


  by phenotype staining of NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood over time when adequate samples were available for analysis. It is important to note that we are early in the safety evaluation and dose-finding part of the Phase I/II trial, and that these results are not statistically significant. 
 The following graphics and commentary, which discuss the first three patients results as reported in February 2021 as a representative sample, address each of these points in turn. 
 

 | Lymphocyte reconstitution. After a single infusion of NEXI-001 T cells, each of the three patients assessed experienced lymphocyte reconstitution early within the range of generally observed lymphocyte reconstitution after lymphodepleting therapy, which is typically one to three months. In the graphic below, absolute lymphocyte counts, or ALC, are depicted over time, and show returns to baseline levels for each patient (marked with a red circle) within 35 days after lymphodepletion (in a range of three to 35 days).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 


We have also generated data on the kind of T cells that are driving this rapid lymphocyte response. In the graphic below, we have collected biomarker data on the first three clinical patients at successive time points over the first month after dosing. The data is organized so that each column is a time point, and each row is a patient. The chart measures the presence of different kinds of T cells, with the x-axis measuring the presence of CD4+ T cells and the y-axis measuring the presence of CD8+ T cells. Overall, this shows the total T cell reconstitution as a proportion of CD8+ T cells (marked with a black box) and CD4+ T cells (marked with a red box). Under normal circumstances, CD8+ T cells dominate the early recovery of the T cell fraction, with CD4+ T cell recovery typically not seen until two or three months after lymphodepleting therapy. The observation of a combined CD8+ and CD4+ T cell immune response, which mimics the desired natural response, is even more intriguing because each infusion of NEXI-001 T cell contains very few, less than 2%, CD4+ T cells. A plausible explanation for this observation may be that the immune signals triggered by the infusion of NEXI-001 T cells recruit tissue-resident CD4+ T cells capable of helping to generate a rapid and robust cell-mediated immune response.

 | Proliferation and persistence of NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells. After a single infusion, NEXI-001 antigen-specific T cells were detectable in peripheral blood samples taken from the two patients who were analyzed, as determined by multimer staining. The graphics below illustrate these findings. First, a detailed analysis of Patient 3 is shown as a representative sample of data from the two patients in the trial who were analyzed. The data on the top row show the presence of antigen-specific cells in the NEXI-001 product. In this case, the x-axis measures the overall presence of CD8+ T cells, and the y-axis measures antigen specificity, with the upper right box indicating the desired CD8+ antigen- specific T cells. In the case of Patient 3, 13.2% of the total T cells in the infusion were specific to one or more of the three antigen peptides targeted. The bottom row shows the same analysis, but 29 days after infusion. This time, 5.4% of the T cells in the peripheral blood sample were CD8+ T cells specific to the antigens of interest. We believe that this high percentage demonstrates that the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell population is proliferating after infusion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The graphic below shows that same percentage of total CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of the patient that are specific to one or more of the three antigen peptides targeted over time after infusion for both patients included in this analysis. As both sets of data show, the antigen-specific T cell populations in each NEXI-001 product expanded over time in the patients, with persistence of up to one and two months, representing the last time points measured in each patient, respectively. 
 




 | Clonal expansion and trafficking of NEXI-001 T cells. TCR sequencing was used to identify and track unique T cell clones from NEXI-001 after each patients infusion. This permits the measurement of clonal presence, expansion and persistence in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow of each patient treated. The graphic below shows that T cell clones from each NEXI-001 product were detectable in the peripheral blood of each patient as early as Day 1, and were observed to expand over time. Additionally, as shown in the graph on the right, T cell clones from each NEXI-001 infusion were shown to effectively traffic from the blood to the bone marrow of each patient and expand over time. In

25 


 
Patient 1, the NEXI-001 T cell clones accounted for more than 50% of the patients entire bone marrow T cell fraction at Month 1. In Patient 2 and Patient 3, NEXI-001 T cell clones accounted for approximately 20% of the total bone marrow T cell fraction at the same time point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Persistence of critical memory T cell phenotypes. Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, the T cell subtype of each NEXI-001 product was maintained in the peripheral blood of each of the three patients over each time point measured after infusion (up to two months). Importantly, the stem cell-like memory T cell and central memory T cell populations that support self-renewal, immunologic memory, long-term persistence and anti-tumor activity were maintained.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The graph below shows data from Patient 2 as a representative sample of these three patients, and shows how the subtypes for each T cell population specific to individual antigen peptide targets were maintained from the NEXI-001 product at two months after infusion. We believe that maintenance of the key T cell subtypes that support self-renewal, immunologic memory, long-term persistence and anti-tumor activity has the potential to deliver potent and durable clinical responses for these patients.

 NEXI-002
NEXI-002 is an autologous cell therapy in Phase I/II clinical development to treat patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM who have failed at least three prior lines of therapy. MM accounts for around 10% to 15% of all hematologic malignancies and primarily affects older individuals, with approximately 32,000 new cases a year in the United States. While significant progress has been made in the treatment of MM, there is currently no cure for the condition. 
 Treatment Paradigm for MM 
 There are currently several T cell therapies under clinical investigation for this patient population. Among them, anti-B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, transduced CAR T therapies have demonstrated early and impressive initial clinical results across multiple Phase II/III clinical trials, with objective responses rates, or ORR, greater than 90% in patients reported within some individual trials, and progression free survival, or PFS, rates of approximately 11 months. As clinical trial experience grows and initial data sets mature, certain and common limitations of these therapies are also becoming evident, with many directly attributable to the technology itself. 
 CAR T therapy, by design, uses an antibody to target a single protein, such as BCMA, expressed on the surface of a plasma cell. These surface proteins are not critical to the survival of the plasma cell, and can be down-regulated when under immune pressure, such as from the CAR T cell. As a result, the tumor cell can avoid detection by the CAR T cell in a process known as tumor escape. We also believe that a primary driver of tumor relapse following CAR T therapy is the loss of CAR T cells from a patients body: the CAR T cells do not persist long enough to maintain a durable clinical response. Due to the way CAR T cells are manufactured, they contain highly potent T cells, but do not contain the natural T cell subtypes that support self-renewal, immunologic memory and long-term persistence. When the CAR T cells die, the cancer can relapse. 
 NEXI-002 was designed to address these emerging limitations of CAR T therapy. 
 

 | Tumor escape. Each infusion of NEXI-002 contains populations of T cells directed to recognize and attack multiple antigen targets on each malignant plasma cell, as shown in the figure below. These targets represent a combination of cell surface antigen proteins, such as CS-1 and CD138, and endogenously presented survival antigen proteins, such as WT-1 and NY-ESO. We believe that by targeting multiple antigen proteins that are over-expressed on each malignant plasma cell, some of which are necessary for tumor cell survival, NEXI-002 has the potential to effectively address tumor escape as an immune evasion mechanism.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tumor relapse. The AIM technology has been optimized to consistently produce product candidates that contain T cell subtypes that support anti-tumor potency, self-renewal, immunologic memory and long-term T cell persistence. We believe the combination of these T cell characteristics has the potential to effectively address disease relapse due to short-term T cell survival.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When taken together, we believe these attributes of NEXI-002 give it the potential to improve the durability of clinical responses observed with current BCMA-transduced CAR T products, extend PFS rates and improve the toxicity profile reported to date when using these genetically engineered T cell modalities. 
 
27 


 As with NEXI-001, our AIM technology is used to produce each NEXI-002 infusion. AIM nanoparticles loaded with MM-specific antigen peptides, enriched and expanded by the E+E system, generate populations of T cells that are directed to recognize and attack the specific antigen targets, as illustrated in the graphic below. 
 


The T cells in each NEXI-002 infusion are designed to be highly potent and highly selective in their ability to distinguish malignant plasma cells from healthy plasma cells, and to contain key T cell subtypes that promote anti-tumor potency, immunologic memory and long-term T cell persistence. We believe this combination of attributes has the potential to deliver deep and durable clinical responses for MM patients who have failed at least three lines of prior therapy. 
 Phase I/II Clinical Trial Design 
 Our ongoing clinical trial with NEXI-002 is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm Phase I/II clinical trial that aims to enroll between 19 and 23 patients. This trial consists of two phases. The initial safety evaluation phase assesses the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-002 within a single dose range. In the second part of the trial, the expansion phase, investigators will further define safety and will also evaluate the initial efficacy of each product candidate at the dose established in the safety evaluation phase. We are currently in the safety evaluation phase of the trial. The trials primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of NEXI-002 T cells in patients with MM who have failed at least three prior lines of therapy. Secondary objectives include signals of anti-tumor activity, ORR (which includes CR), OS and PFS. Additional biomarker analysis will assess the in vivo persistence, proliferation, functionality and TCR repertoire of NEXI-002 T cells as measured in blood and bone marrow samples. Our clinical endpoints have been recognized as appropriate measurements of safety and clinical response. The Dana Farber Cancer Center is the lead clinical trial site for this trial, with additional trial sites at the City of Hope Cancer Center, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Karmanos Cancer Institute, and the Advent Hospital in Orlando, Florida.

Preliminary Data from the Phase I/II Clinical Trial 
 In February 2021, we reported that we had treated two patients in the Dose Level 1 safety cohort. As reported in February 2021, with a median follow-up of one month on two patients, there had been no treatment-related SAEs or TRAEs reported after a single infusion of NEXI-002 T cells, including no CRS, ICANs or IRRs. Analyses of immunologic and clinical activity are ongoing. We expect to announce three-month data from the completed safety cohort by the end of the second quarter of 2021. Initial data for most patients in the trial, including the expansion cohort, is expected by the end of 2021. 
Future Opportunities 
 Moving forward, we expect to pursue additional modality applications and indications across multiple disease areas. Our strategy is to establish clinical proof of concept, or POC, for the AIM technology with NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 in hematologic malignancies, and then to develop new AIM ACT and AIM INJ product candidates to expand into solid tumors, with potential further expansion into autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. We have generated a significant body of non-clinical data to support this approach, which we use to prioritize our clinical development efforts and to identify potential disease areas and indications to pursue. 
 

 | Solid Tumors. The scientific community has identified, robustly characterized and clinically evaluated over 75 specific antigen targets across multiple solid tumor types, and we plan to use this data to inform our next wave of product development in oncology. We intend to identify a basket of solid tumors that share a common set of highly immunogenic and clinically validated tumor-relevant antigen targets for inclusion in our next AIM ACT clinical program. We envision this program will evaluate a new AIM ACT product candidate as both monotherapy and in combination with a tumor microenvironment, or TME, altering therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors. We plan to evaluate clinical POC to support the AIM technology in solid tumors, which would serve as the basis for the introduction of an AIM INJ product candidate into early clinical development for solid tumor indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Autoimmune Disorders. We believe that our AIM technology will enable us to target autoimmune conditions using either the AIM ACT or AIM INJ modality. For most autoimmune disorders like Type 1 Diabetes, autoreactive (or self-destructive) T cells become the cells targeted for therapeutic intervention. For these conditions, AIM nanoparticles are loaded with Signal 1 antigen peptides that autoreactive T cells recognize, and Signal 2 is programmed to deliver a suppressive or apoptotic signal that either tolerizes or eliminates the disease-causing T cells. In conditions like multiple sclerosis, or MS, the Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, plays a critical role in mediating the disease process. Eliminating EBV-infected cells with EBV-specific T cells has been shown by others to impact disease progression
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
29 


 
for patients with Primary Progressive MS. We believe that EBV-specific AIM ACT or AIM INJ product candidates can be developed for clinical evaluation in various forms of MS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Infectious Diseases. We believe that there may be significant opportunities to address other viral-mediated diseases using the AIM platform to develop either AIM ACT or AIM INJ product candidates. We also believe that the AIM technology may offer a novel approach to the rapid treatment of, and preparation for, future viral-epidemics and pandemics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expanding to new HLA allele subtype populations. We are also developing additional HLA allele subtypes. NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 currently use the HLA-A2 allele, which is most prevalent within the Caucasian ethnicity. However, the additional HLA subtypes we plan to develop, including HLA-A1, HLA-A11, HLA-A24 and HLA-B7, would broaden the patient eligibility of future product candidates. We believe the modular AIM platform will facilitate the rapid development of nanoparticles that exchange the current HLA-A2 for new HLA subtypes, which could then be used for all AIM product candidates in development.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we continually survey the scientific and industry landscape for opportunities to license, partner or acquire technologies that may help us advance current or new T cell therapies for the benefit of patients. 
 Manufacturing 
 Using our AIM technology platform, we have developed a manufacturing process that benefits from the interchangeability and modular nature of the platform. We believe that our manufacturing process possesses a number of key advantages, including (i) consistent characterization of the final T cells across indications, (ii) a reproducible process that delivers the same composition and quality of final T cells across indications regardless of peptide mix used or source of PBMC, whether patient or donor, (iii) the ability to rapidly modify and test process refinements for comparability of the final product, and (iv) the potential to increase efficiency and to rapidly scale up the manufacturing process. We also believe that these attributes address many of the manufacturing challenges faced by other cell therapy approaches, including the inability to control for composition, longer manufacturing times and scale-up limitations. 
 Manufacturing Process 
 The manufacture of the AIM nanoparticles, regardless of application, includes the production of two signaling proteins, which, when conjugated to the core nanoparticles (SPIO or PLGA/PEG) comprise the AIM nanoparticles. When the peptide-loaded Signal 1 protein is combined with the co-stimulatory Signal 2 protein on the nanoparticle, the resulting AIM nanoparticles simulate classic antigen presentation and co-stimulatory signals directly to relevant T cells. 
 The Proteins 
 Our current AIM ACT and AIM INJ nanoparticles share the same Signal 1 and Signal 2 proteins aligned to the specified therapeutic goal. Signal 1, shown on the left in the graphic below, is a humanized HLA.A*02.01 IgG4 (Fc) fusion protein hinge dimer, which is designed for the specific loading of disease-relevant antigen peptides to deliver the antigen specific signal to a targeted T cell. Signal 2, shown on the right in the graphic below, is a humanized anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody, which is designed to provide the co-stimulatory or go signal for activation and proliferation. Both Signal 1 and Signal 2 are provided simultaneously to T cells by the AIM nanoparticles, within AIM ACT or AIM INJ modalities. As a result, our design specifications for nanoparticle production also include the density and ratio of protein signals.

Signal 1: HLA-A*02:01 (IgG4) fusion protein | Signal 2: anti-CD28 antibody

 Our molecular engineering approach employs a modular cassette to design, build and test novel protein constructs, which enables rapid selection for new product development. As part of our modular system, all proteins include free cysteines, which are used for coupling of the proteins to the nanoparticle core. 
 Our proteins are manufactured by a third-party CMO. These same proteins are used for both modalities. 
 AIM ACT Nanoparticle 
 The AIM ACT nanoparticles are produced by coupling the HLA.A*02.01 hinge dimer and anti-CD28 antibody proteins to the SPIO core, which is approximately 80 to 100 nanometers in diameter and consistent with our design specifications. AIM ACT nanoparticles are produced by a third-party CMO. Our site-directed coupling methods have been designed to control for protein density, protein ratio and to direct the functional ends of both proteins outward for T cell engagement and signaling. The manufacturing of the AIM ACT core nanoparticle, which is antigen-peptide unloaded, takes approximately seven days and is illustrated below in the graphic on the left. Peptide loading of AIM ACT core nanoparticles is accomplished by loading each individual peptide of the selected peptide mix separately using individual nanoparticle aliquots, illustrated below in the graphic on the right. While different peptide combinations are used for NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, the peptide loading procedure is the same and is completed in approximately three days. Each product-specific peptide-loaded nanoparticle mix is washed to remove excess peptides followed by fill-finish and release of vials for use in the manufacturing of NEXI-001 or NEXI-002. This standardized approach to coupling proteins to core nanoparticles and to peptide loading methods was established during process development and designed to enable rapid interchangeability of protein or peptide mixes to develop new product candidates regardless of the modality, whether AIM ACT or AIM INJ. 
AIM ACT Product 
 The AIM ACT product for each patient, whether NEXI-001 and NEXI-002, is manufactured using our proprietary E+E system. This system has been developed and optimized to consistently produce T cells with the combined differentiation attributes described in the platform technology section regardless of peptide mix, whether NEXI-001 or NEXI-002, or starting PBMC source material, whether donor or patient. For clinical manufacturing, we have developed an automated, fully-closed cell-processing system, and custom application programs to perform our proprietary E+E process using the AIM ACT nanoparticles. The manufacturing process is completed in approximately 14 days.

 The current Phase I/II clinical manufacturing of NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 is performed by a third-party CMO. The following graphic summarizes our manufacturing process, which is further described below. 
 


Cells are collected via apheresis from healthy donors for the manufacture of NEXI-001 or from MM patients for the manufacture of NEXI-002 and shipped to our CMO for the manufacture of the final T cell product. The E+E system involves the following key steps. 
 

 | CD8+ enrichment. The first step is designed to enrich for CD8+ T cells by deleting unwanted cells such as CD4+ T cells, monocytes and neutrophils.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CD8+ antigen-specific enrichment. The remaining CD8+ enriched cells are co-cultured with the product-specific mix of peptide loaded AIM ACT nanoparticles for NEXI-001 or NEXI-002. After incubation with the peptide loaded ACT nanoparticles, the cells are passed through a magnetic column where the ACT nanoparticle engaged antigen-specific CD8+ cells are captured and pulled down and proceed to the expansion phase, while remaining non-target cells flow through, shown in the graphic above as the discarded fraction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion. The CD8+ antigen specific enriched cells are transferred to the expansion chamber and cultured for 14 days using media and our proprietary cytokine mix. During this phase, T cells that are engaged with the AIM nanoparticles via Signal 1 and 2 transition their phenotype from naïve to memory, which also primes the T cells cytolytic properties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Harvest and formulation. Final T cells are harvested from the expansion chamber, washed to remove media, cytokines and residual AIM ACT nanoparticles and then formulated with dimethyl sulfoxide, used as a cryoprotectant, in infusion bags (20 milliliters or 40 milliliters). There are no detectable AIM ACT nanoparticles or free protein remaining in the final product. The final formulated cells are frozen and upon release are shipped to the site for patient administration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Product release specifications include CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, total antigen specificity, purity and sterility. Our manufacturing process has demonstrated consistency in producing T cells with the desired composition and quality for release. Additionally, our manufacturing process consistently produces T cells that include the important memory subtypes, Tscm, Tcm and Tem. While this is not required as a release specification, we believe it is an important differentiating attribute. 
 Our manufacturing process has been extensively tested across multiple different peptides, peptide mixes and nanoparticle lots. One specific experiment was conducted to demonstrate consistency and to evaluate the variance contribution of each donor (or patient) versus the variance contribution of the process using 26 split runs with 13 healthy donor PBMCs as starting material. Split runs are conducted by dividing the apheresis material in half after the first step and running the E+E process on two different machines with two different operators in 
 
32 


  parallel. To further test the performance of the manufacturing process, the experiment also evaluated different AIM ACT nanoparticle lots, peptide mixes, manufacturing machines and operators. Regardless of nanoparticle lot, peptide mix, machine or operator, the variances in the final product results were driven primarily by each donor or patient source material (approximately 98% of the variances), and not the process (less than 2%). Similar runs were used to further optimize key manufacturing steps. 
 AIM INJ Nanoparticle 
 The AIM INJ program is based on the core nanoparticle material using PLGA-PEG polymers. PLGA and PEG have been widely used in pharmaceutical formulations. 
 The AIM INJ core nanoparticle is produced using the two polymers at a defined ratio to meet our specification. The core nanoparticle manufacturing will be conducted in a fully closed multi-unit system that complies with current good manufacturing procedures, or cGMP, and provides a scale-up process that is achieved through multiplying our current manufacturing process rather than a more traditional process scale-up for larger scale production. Once scale-up has occurred, we anticipate that the PLGA-PEG core nanoparticles will be able to be manufactured in approximately three days. The same proteins, protein conjugation and peptide loading methods used to produce AIM ACT nanoparticles are used to manufacture the AIM INJ nanoparticles, which is the final product. We anticipate that the manufacturing time for the final AIM INJ product candidate will be approximately three to five days, followed by a fill-finish process and release. 
Manufacturing Strategy 
 We currently plan to use third-party CMOs for near term manufacturing. However, in the future we may decide to bring some manufacturing capabilities in house. Our current manufacturing strategy is designed to address clinical and, if approved, commercial supply for the United States; however, we anticipate the same strategy can be applied to expand into other geographic regions. 
Commercialization 
 Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused commercial organization in the United States to market, sell and distribute our products. We believe that such an organization can efficiently address the community of hematologists and oncologists who are the key specialists treating the patient populations for which our most advanced product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to support any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. 
 Given our potential to generate novel product candidates with potential to address a wide variety of cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases, we may also consider opportunistically entering into strategic partnerships focused on certain targets, product candidates, disease areas or geographies. These collaborations could advance and accelerate our current clinical and platform development programs in ways that could maximize product availability and value creation. 
 Competition 
 We are initially developing product candidates to address hematological malignancies, which will be followed by an expansion into solid tumors, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. Accordingly, we may face competitors from multiple biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, many of which have access to greater resources, technical expertise and broader collaborations that could result in faster development, exclusive access to novel enabling technologies, biomarker-based differentiation or commercialization. These competitors also compete for recruiting and retaining talent in critical areas of research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercial functions. If NEXI-001, NEXI-002 or any of our future product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors. 
 
33 


 The field of immuno-oncology is rapidly evolving, and we expect to compete with companies developing other approaches to direct T cell function. These include but are not limited to, the following modalities. 
 Genetically Engineered T Cells 
 These include both CAR-T and TCR engineered cell therapies being developed as treatments for MM and AML. CAR-T cell therapies generally target single cell surface antigen proteins and are mostly limited to blood tumors, including products and product candidates being developed at companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Inc. and Mustang Bio, Inc. We also expect to compete with TCR engineered cell therapies, which employ high affinity TCRs against a single endogenously presented antigen peptide, including products and product candidates being developed by companies such as Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Immatics N.V. 
 Non-engineered T Cells 
 These are cell therapy approaches that employ the ex vivo activation and expansion of non-genetically engineered endogenous T cells, including TIL products, such as those being developed by Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., and antigen presenting cell, or APC, based systems, ex vivo activation and expansion systems, such as those being developed by Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc. and Marker Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Cancer Vaccines 
 Cancer vaccine approaches rely on host antigen presenting cells as intermediaries to process and present specific signals that direct a targeted T cell function, including products and product candidates being developed at companies like SQZ Biotechnologies Company, BioNTech SE and Moderna, Inc. 
Antibody Platforms 
 These modalities employ modified antibodies to redirect T cell function and include bispecific T cell engagers, or BiTEs, and dual-affinity re-targeting proteins, or DARTs, including products and product candidates being developed at companies like Amgen Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson and MacroGenics, Inc. 
 Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may, or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products. These competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. 
Johns Hopkins License Agreement 
 In June 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Johns Hopkins, which was subsequently amended and then superseded in January 2017 by an amended and restated exclusive license agreement, which we refer to as the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement. Pursuant to the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement, we have (i) an exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell artificial antigen presenting cells (AIM nanoparticles) covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins in therapeutic, diagnostic and non-clinical fields, (ii) an exclusive license to make have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell fusion proteins covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins in the therapeutic field, (iii) a non-exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale and sell fusion proteins covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins in diagnostic and non-clinical fields and (iv) a non-exclusive right to use Johns Hopkinss know-how to develop, make, have made and sell products covered by patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins and to develop and provide services covered by the patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins. The rights licensed to us are worldwide and include the right to grant sublicenses. 
 
34 


 Johns Hopkins retains rights to practice the patent rights and know-how for itself and other non-profit academic and non-profit research institutions for any non-profit, non-commercial research or other non-commercial purpose. The United States government may have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States throughout the world the inventions described in the patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins that were supported by federal funding. We may be obligated to manufacture the products sold or used in the United States that are covered by patent rights supported by federal funding substantially in the United States. 
 Under the terms of the 2011 license agreement and the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement, Johns Hopkins was entitled to an up-front license fee of $155,000 and we issued them 26,918 shares of our common stock. Johns Hopkins was also entitled to milestone fees of $75,000 in connection with clinical trial milestones. For the first licensed product or licensed service in the therapeutic field, we may be required to pay Johns Hopkins additional aggregate milestone fees of $1.625 million for clinical and regulatory milestone fees. We may be required to pay Johns Hopkins reduced milestone fees for the second and third licensed products or licensed services in the therapeutic field in connection with clinical and regulatory milestones. In the diagnostic field, we may be required to pay Johns Hopkins aggregate milestone fees of $400,000 for the first licensed product or licensed service and reduced milestone fees for the second and third licensed products or licensed services. We may be required to pay Johns Hopkins aggregate milestone fees of $100,000 for commercial milestones for the first licensed product or licensed service in the non-clinical field. In the aggregate, we may be required to pay Johns Hopkins additional milestone fees of up to $4.225 million for all clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones for all licensed products or licensed services in the therapeutic field, the diagnostic field and the non-clinical field. We may also be required to pay royalties in the low to upper single digits on net sales of licensed products and licensed services in the therapeutic field, diagnostic field and non-clinical field that are covered by the patent rights owned by Johns Hopkins or use know-how of Johns Hopkins. We are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of $100,000 to Johns Hopkins for the remainder of the term of the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement; the amount of the minimum annual royalty payment started in the low five figures in the first year of the agreement and increased to $100,000 in the third year of the agreement. We may also be required to pay Johns Hopkins a low double digit percentage, not to exceed 15%, of any non-royalty sublicense consideration we receive. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain clinical and technical diligence milestones. 
 In the event Johns Hopkins or another party provides us with clinical or other evidence demonstrating the practicality of a particular market or use within the therapeutic, diagnostic or non-clinical fields that we are not developing or commercializing, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to start development or attempt to sublicense to a suitable third party for that particular market or use. If we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to commence development or do not grant a sublicense to a suitable third party, all rights to that particular use will revert back to Johns Hopkins at no cost and Johns Hopkins will be able to license that particular use to third parties. We are not required to cause development of any licensed product or licensed service for a particular market or use if we reasonably demonstrate to Johns Hopkins that developing such licensed products or licensed services or granting a sublicense for such market or use would a have a potentially adverse commercial effect upon licensed products or licensed services being developed or sold by us, our affiliates or our existing sublicensees. 
 Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the agreement, the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement and the royalty obligations thereunder will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product or licensed service-by-licensed service and country-by-country basis until the expiration date of the last-to-expire patent or, if no patents issue, until the tenth anniversary of the agreement, at which time the licenses will become fully paid up and royalty-free. 
 We or Johns Hopkins may terminate the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement if the other party files for insolvency or if there is an uncured breach of obligations or failure to perform by the other party. We may terminate the A&R Johns Hopkins License Agreement upon giving Johns Hopkins 90 days written notice.

 Intellectual Property 
 We believe that our patents and patent applications, and other proprietary rights, that we own or control through licensing, are important to our business and competitive position. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovations to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, advisors and other parties. Our success will depend in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensor, to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce our patents, including those patents and applications to which we have exclusive rights. 
 We own or have exclusively licensed five issued United States patents and nine pending patent applications for the United States, two of which are allowed. We also have 36 issued or allowed foreign patents and 54 pending foreign patent applications (including PCT Applications) intended to protect the intellectual property underlying our technology. In addition to the United States, we have patents issued or applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe (EPO), Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation, and Singapore. Our patent applications describe and claim certain features of our technologies, including our T cell activation and expansion platform, our cell therapy product candidates, and our drug candidates based on injectable artificial antigen presenting cells. We currently control issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea which relate to the technology for generating our cell therapy products (NEXI-001 and NEXI-002) from allogeneic or autologous T cells. Applications relating to our NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 programs remain pending in all jurisdictions for which we have filed patent applications, including more recent patent applications that relate in part to the NEXI-001 and NEXI-002 composition of matter. In addition, we control issued or allowed patents in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, and Europe that relate to our AIM INJ programs, including patents covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Applications relating to our AIM INJ programs remain pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, South Korea, Singapore, and United States. We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property, including filing patent applications for our innovations, prosecuting our pending patent applications, and maintaining and enforcing our issued patents. No assurances can be given that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, issued patents may be circumvented by third parties, or found unenforceable or invalid if contested before a court or administrative agency. Thus, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us. 
 Each of our patents, if and when granted, will generally have a term of 20 years from its earliest, non-provisional filing date, subject to available extensions. Our patents and, if granted, patent applications have expiry dates ranging from 2034 to 2039. 
 For more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see the section of this filing on Form 10-K captioned Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Therapeutic products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals or clearances, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, denial of export applications, governmental prohibitions on entering into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals or the restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or clearances, as well as any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In connection with therapeutic approval, we will have to comply with the many requirements associated with preclinical and clinical trials, the FDA application process, the terms of any pre-certification protocols and agreements, FDA manufacturing requirements for prototypes, and testing. Upon 
 
36 


  approval of a Biologics License Application, or BLA and similar approvals in other jurisdictions, there will be additional regulation relating to the packaging, distribution, marking, marketing and claims of our potential products. These later regulations are not only found in federal regulation but many states and, of course, foreign countries. 
 The U.S. FDA Process 
 The FDA regulates the clinical testing and design of therapeutics to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended uses. The application process for a new therapeutic is highly regulated. 
 As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by relevant authorities. Our potential products will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our potential products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with cGMP established by the FDA for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization. 
 Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local levels) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in a foreign country. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 U.S. Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and their respective implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The FDA has limited experience with commercial development of T cell therapies for cancer, including direct-injectable technologies such as AIM INJ. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
37 


 
 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDAs current Good Tissue Practices, or cGTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the trial and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies 
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our drug candidates, in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 Human clinical trials in support of a BLA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to human research subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during a clinical trial due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, the trial may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 
38 


 Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent form that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the investigational product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase I. The product candidate is initially introduced into human subjects to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. The initial human testing is often conducted in patients, rather than in healthy volunteers, in the case of products for severe or life-threatening diseases.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase II. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible safety risks (adverse effects), optimize dosing and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety, often at geographically dispersed trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events, or SAEs, occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, GCP, or other IRB requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor known as the data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints. 
 
39 


 During the development of a new drug or biological product, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before submission of a BLA. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results with the agency and to present their plans for the pivotal Phase III studies that they believe will support approval of the new drug or biological product. 
 Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the products chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. A BLA in particular must contain proof of the biological product candidates safety, purity, potency and efficacy for its proposed indication or indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a products use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 According to the goals and policies for original BLAs agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. For all BLAs, the ten and six-month time periods run from the filing date; for all other original applications, the ten and six-month time periods run from the submission date. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of a BLA to extend beyond the goal date. 
 
40 


 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the products identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date it is accepted for filing, and most applications for priority review products are meant to be reviewed within six months from the date the application is accepted for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making final decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the cGTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cellular tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase III or Phase II/III clinical trial. The initial PSP 
 
41 


  must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. On the basis of the FDAs evaluation of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval from the FDA, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a products safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation and priority review designation and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for 
 
42 


  more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process. 
 In addition, with the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as breakthrough therapies upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, which are intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDAs goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA from the date of filing. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, congress created an accelerated approval pathway for regenerative medicine advanced therapies, or RMATs, which includes therapeutic tissue engineered products, human cell and tissue products, cell therapies and combination products using any such therapies. The program is intended to facilitate expedited development and review of RMATs intended to address serious diseases or conditions. 
 A sponsor may request a RMAT designation from the FDA concurrently with or any time after the IND submission. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine if the drug product meets the required criteria. Preliminary clinical evidence that the product has the potential to address a serious unmet need or condition is expected, is not required to indicate that the drug product may offer significant improvement over current therapies. The RMAT designation provides the same benefits of the fast track and breakthrough designation programs and programs may be eligible for priority review. Products with the RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval if pre-agreed criteria are met. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA 
 
43 


  may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsors agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drugs clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether the drug or biologic is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a product containing 
 
44 


  the same active moiety for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A product is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our potential products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our product candidate or if our product candidates indication is determined to be contained within the competitors product orphan indication. In addition, the FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusivity if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the product is clinically superior to a previously approved product containing the same active moiety for the same orphan condition, regardless of whether or not the approved product was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. 
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our biological products, some of our US patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. These patent term extensions permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Pediatric exclusivity 
 Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDAs request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. 
 Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. 
 A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the 
 
45 


  reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product, although to date no such products have been approved for marketing in the United States. 
 The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. 
 A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed. If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. First licensure typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the first licensure of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 The BPCIA is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any potential products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved uses (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, it is FDAs position that manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or 
 
46 


  manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the quality and long-term stability of the product. We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our potential products in accordance with cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our CMOs that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below. 
 Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
47 


 
 | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations within the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. It is not yet clear how the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union will affect the approval of medicinal products in the UK. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 European Union drug development, review and approval 
 In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an IMPD (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the competent national authority and the Ethics Committee of the Member State where they occurred. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted and it is anticipated to come into application in late 2020 or early 2021. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials 
 
48 


  Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the EU portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures. 
 Centralized procedure 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all 27 European Union member states, or EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks. 
 National authorization procedures 
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
 

 | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 
49 


 Conditional approval 
 In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. 
 Pediatric studies 
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. 
 Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. 
 European Union regulatory exclusivity 
 In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
50 


 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The ten-year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
 

 | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 PRIME designation 
 The EMA grants access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program to investigational medicines for which it determines there to be preliminary data available showing the potential to address an unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. As part of the program, EMA provides early and enhanced dialogue and support to optimize the development of eligible medicines and speed up their evaluation, aiming to bring promising treatments to patients sooner. 
 Periods of authorization and renewals 
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).

 Rest of the world regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products approved by the FDA will depend in significant part on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement for the products. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Further, there is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. 
 Moreover, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower. 
 The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as 
 
52 


  part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states) can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 
 Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors expose us to broadly applicable healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business, such as fraud and abuse, transparency and health information privacy rules and regulations. These laws include, without limitation: 

 | the federal anti-kickback statute, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the civil monetary penalties law, which among other things prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, for covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that provide services to, or on behalf of, the covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require certain manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information related to payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships and interactions with foreign government officials, which prohibit U.S. companies and their employees, officers, and representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official (including, potentially, healthcare professionals in countries in which we operate or may sell our products), government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise seek favorable treatment; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
53 


 
 | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. In addition, state and local laws may require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, may subject us to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
 Health Care Reform in the United States and Potential Changes to Health Care Laws 
 The FDAs and other regulatory authorities policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 As previously mentioned, a primary trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 There remain judicial, executive branch and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. In particular, in December of 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective January 1, 2019. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether other reforms enacted as part of the ACA but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance, including the provisions comprising the BPCIA, could be severed from the rest of the ACA so as not to be declared invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. It is also unclear how such litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. 
 
54 


 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act that affect health care expenditures. There has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products. Notably, on December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 or the CREATES Act. The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic and biosimilar product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic and biosimilar products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on commercially reasonable, market- based terms. Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administrations proposals. The FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. 
 However, the impact of such future programs is uncertain. The programs may be vulnerable to being overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval from Congress under the procedures set forth in the Congressional Review Act, which could be applied to regulatory actions taken by the Trump Administration on or after August 21, 2020 (i.e., in the last 60 days of legislative session of the 116th Congress). Other regulatory actions that were initiated or finalized during the final months of the Trump Administration are also subject to uncertainty following the January 20, 2021 transition to a new Democrat-led presidential administration. Following his inauguration, President Biden took immediate steps to order a regulatory freeze on all pending substantive executive actions in order to permit incoming department and agency heads to review whether questions of fact, policy, and law may be implicated and to determine how to proceed. 
 We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services.
