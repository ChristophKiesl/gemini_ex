Item 1.        Business
Overview
Historically, we were a clinical-stage company focused on developing gene therapies to radically transform the lives of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We previously had three clinical-stage programs: AXO-AAV-GM1 for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis, AXO-AAV-GM2 for the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis (including Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases) and AXO-Lenti-PD for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Currently, we are winding down these three clinical-stage programs while also working on one pre-clinical program.
In June 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Oxford Agreement”) with Oxford Biomedica (UK) Ltd. (“Oxford”) pursuant to which we received a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Oxford to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD and related gene therapy products. In February 2022, we provided notice to Oxford to terminate the Oxford Agreement to develop and commercialize AXO-Lenti-PD and related gene therapy product candidates. We determined to terminate the Oxford Agreement and redirect resources to our AXO-AAV-GM1 and -GM2 programs, as well as other strategic initiatives, due to several factors, including the resource requirements and development timelines to reach meaningful value inflection for the program and an increasingly challenging market and regulatory environment for Parkinson’s disease. We will continue to incur immaterial expenses in connection with the Oxford Agreement until its termination becomes effective.
In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “UMMS Agreement”) with the University of Massachusetts Medical School (“UMMS”) pursuant to which we received a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable license under certain patent applications and any patents issuing therefrom, biological materials and know-how controlled by UMMS to develop and commercialize gene therapy product candidates, including AXO-AAV-GM1 and AXO-AAV-GM2, for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis and GM2 gangliosidosis (including Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease). In April 2022, we provided notice to UMMS to terminate the UMMS Agreement. The UMMS Agreement will be formally terminated following the 90-day wind-down/termination notice period. We will continue to conduct clinical operations for the AXO-AAV-GM1 and AXO-AAV-GM2 programs under the UMMS Agreement during the 90-day wind-down/termination period.
In parallel with our decision to terminate the AXO-AAV-GM1 and -GM2 programs, in April 2022, our board of directors approved and we announced the strategic decision to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value from our existing cash and cash equivalents, including a potential sale, merger, business combination or similar transaction. In connection with these actions, and as approved by our board of directors, we began implementing a significant headcount reduction, which we expect to conclude in June 2022. As part of these strategic decisions, we expect to incur aggregate costs estimated to range from approximately $0.9 million to $1.5 million relating to the reduction in headcount, all to be incurred during the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022. 
While we continue to conduct certain pre-clinical research and development initiatives in gene therapy, we expect to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, there can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. We have not set a timetable for completion of this strategic review process, and our board of directors has not approved a definitive course of action. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value or that we will make any additional cash distribution to our stockholders. In addition, we expect to incur additional operating expenses associated with the wind-down of the UMMS Agreement and the Oxford Agreement, including clinical trial activities that we will continue to conduct during the wind-down period.
The Domestication
We have substantially completed our previously disclosed corporate transformation to align corporate structure and governance with current and future business activity, including significantly reducing the number of our subsidiaries. On November 12, 2020, Axovant Gene Therapies Ltd. ("AGT") discontinued as a Bermuda exempted company pursuant to Section 132G of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, and pursuant to Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), continued its existence under the DGCL as a corporation named Sio Gene Therapies Inc. ("Sio") organized in the State of Delaware. The Domestication effected a change in our jurisdiction of incorporation, and other changes of a legal nature, including changes in our organizational documents. Our consolidated business, operations, assets and liabilities did not change upon effectiveness of the Domestication. However, following the Domestication, the principal executive offices and registered offices of Sio are located at 130 West 42nd St, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10036, and the telephone number for Sio at its principal executive offices is 1 (877) 746-4891. The fiscal year end of Sio Gene Therapies Inc. following the Domestication remains at March 31. In addition, our directors and executive officers immediately after the Domestication were the same individuals who were directors and executive officers, respectively, immediately prior to the Domestication.
In the Domestication, each of our currently issued and outstanding common shares automatically converted by operation of law, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of Sio common stock. Consequently, upon the effectiveness of the Domestication, each holder of an AGT common share instead holds a share of Sio common stock representing the same proportional equity interest in Sio as that stockholder held in AGT and representing the same class of shares. The number of shares of Sio common stock outstanding immediately after the Domestication is the same as the number of common shares of AGT. outstanding immediately prior to the Domestication. In connection with the Domestication, we adopted a new certificate of incorporation, bylaws and form of common stock certificate, copies of which were filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1, respectively, to our Report on Form 8-K12G3 filed with the SEC on November 13, 2020.
Manufacturing 
We currently do not own or operate facilities for product manufacturing. We previously engaged with third parties and our license partners to manufacture our program materials, which we expect to cease following termination of the UMMS Agreement and Oxford Agreement and related wind-down activities. We previously hired experienced personnel with gene therapy product formulation and manufacturing expertise.
Competition 
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We and any future strategic partner will face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize similar products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we and/or our collaborators may develop.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability and the ability of any future strategic partner to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and other know-how. Our commercial success also depends on our ability and the ability of any future strategic partner to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities where appropriate to develop our proprietary position.
While we aim to seek broad coverage when filing and prosecuting patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process of obtaining patents or changes to the patent law in the United States or elsewhere may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to challenge or avoid infringement of any patents that might issue. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will issue from our or any future strategic partner's pending applications or any future applications or that any future patents that might issue will adequately protect our intellectual property or cover our future product candidates.
If granted, individual patents are valid for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal patent term in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent's term can be extended via Patent Term Adjustment ("PTA") to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (the "USPTO") delay in issuing the patent as well as via Patent Term Extension ("PTE") to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the PTE period can be applied to only one patent per approved product, cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the PTE period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, on a claim by claim basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its filing date; however, unlike in the United States, a European patent is not granted PTA for delays at the European Patent Office. However, the European Union does have a compensation program similar to the U.S.’s PTE called Supplementary Patent Certificate ("SPC") that would effectively extend patent protection for term lost during regulatory delay, if any, for up to five years on one patent and the total patent term including the SPC must not exceed 15 years following the EMA granting of marketing authorization. 
Furthermore, we may rely upon trade secrets and know-how, continuing technological innovation and future strategic partnerships to develop our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have or seek confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with selected partners and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees or through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our current and future partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success for future product candidates will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or future commercial strategies, or alter our future product candidate(s) or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize future product candidate(s) may have an adverse impact on our business. 
Government Regulation
In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"). The FDCA, PHSA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Our remaining clinical activities will also require us to comply with varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality and safety and governing clinical trials.
In addition, although we do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate, as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"), on which our shares of common stock are traded.
We are also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to safe working conditions, and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants.
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended ("FCPA"). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, and agents. However, our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement activity by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of June 3, 2022, we had 12 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
We are committed to protecting our employees everywhere we operate. We have taken additional measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including offering COVID-19 testing, as necessary. As of June 3, 2022, all of our employees are fully-remote workers as we are now a remote-first company.
