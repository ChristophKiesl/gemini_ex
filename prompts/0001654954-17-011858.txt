ITEM 1.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

 
 Level Brands strives to be an innovative licensing, marketing and brand management company with a focus on lifestyle-based products. We champion a bold, unconventional image, and social consciousness for our company and our brands. Working closely with our Chairman Emeritus and Chief Brand Strategist, Kathy Ireland, the Chairman, CEO and Chief Designer of kathy ireland® Worldwide, we seek to secure strategic licenses and joint venture partnerships for our brands, as well as to grow the portfolio of brands through strategic acquisitions. In November 2017 we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) raising $12,000,000 in gross proceeds through the sale of our common stock. We expect to deploy these proceeds for brand development and expansion, sales and marketing, and general working capital.
  
 We operate our business in four business units, including:
  
 
 | Licensing division | Founded in 2017 and first conceptualized by kathy ireland® Worldwide, I'M1 is a lifestyle brand established to capitalize on potentially lucrative licensing and co-branding opportunities with products focused on millennials. 
-----------------------------+------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Entertainment division | Also founded in 2017, EE1 was established to serve as a producer and marketer of experiential entertainment including recordings, film, TV, web and live events, and entertainment experiences. EE1 also provides brand management services including creative development and marketing, brand strategy, and distribution support.
 | kathy ireland® Health & Wellness | Our newest business unit established in September 2017, kathy ireland® Health & Wellness' goal is to create a brand which will include a wide variety of licensed products and services, targeted to both Baby Boomers as well as millennials. 
"Beauty belongs to everyone" | Professional products division | Beauty & Pin-Ups, our first business unit is a professional hair care line with a social conscience and launched its products in 2015. We offer quality hair care products, including shampoos, conditioners, styling aides and a patented styling tool, through an expanding professional salon distribution network.

 Our mission is to focus on designing and building the brand with innovation that customers and business partners can use, exceeding market needs, creating sustainable cost advantages and fighting commoditization. We expect that this focus will include aspects of how we brand, promote, access, incorporate and utilize the products. We have expanded the United Nations "Millennium Development Goals" which below are part of our mission:
  
 
• | We must eradiate extreme poverty and hunger | • | Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases 
--+---------------------------------------------+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Achieve universal primary education | • | Ensure environmental sustainability 
• | Promote gender equality and empower women | • | Develop a global partnership for development 
• | Reduce child mortality | • | Stop Human Trafficking 
• | Improve maternal health | • | Bring opportunities of financial stability and healthcare to American Veterans and their families


 
  Our strategy
  
 Our business strategy is to maximize the potential value of our brands primarily through strategic licenses and joint venture partnerships around the world, as well as to grow the portfolio of brands through strategic acquisitions. We believe our business model enables us to use the brand management expertise at our disposal, through our relationship with kathy ireland® Worldwide, to continue to grow our portfolio of brands and generate new revenue streams without significantly changing our infrastructure. We believe our business model provides numerous benefits, including:
  
 
● | potential for financial upside without the significant investment and management risks and capital demands typically associated with traditional wholesale operating companies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | diversification resulting from both broad demographic appeal and distribution through a range of distribution channels; 
● | growth opportunity through expansion of existing brands into new categories, geographic areas and acquisitions; and 
● | reduced operational risks as inventory and other typical wholesale operating functions are the responsibilities of our licensees. 


 
 We plan to continue to build and maintain our brand portfolio by developing our existing brands and acquiring additional brands directly or through joint ventures or partnerships. In assessing potential acquisitions or joint ventures, we expect to primarily evaluate the strength of the target brand as well as the expected viability and sustainability of future royalty streams and its fit within its targeted segments as well as in segments where we believe significant opportunity lies. We believe that this focused approach will allow us to effectively screen a wide pool of consumer brand candidates and other asset light businesses that meet our criteria, strategically evaluate targets and efficiently complete due diligence for potential acquisition. Ms. Ireland, in her role as Chief Brand Strategist, is expected to provide significant input to our management in the identification and evaluation of potential acquisitions or joint ventures.
  
  Our relationship with kathy ireland® Worldwide
  
 We are a party to multiple agreements with kathy ireland® Worldwide and principals of that privately held company that are key to our ability to implement our business strategy and provide services under the various other third party agreements with licensors, brands and other partners, including
  
 
• | In February 2017 we entered into an eight year master advisory and consulting agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide, as amended, pursuant to which it provides us non-exclusive strategic advisory services, including input to us on various aspects of our corporate strategies and branding. Their in-house design team supports our brands and the future licensing partnerships by providing unified trend direction, guidance and coordination of the brand image across all

 | product categories and focuses on seeking to forecast the future design and product demands of the our brand’s customers. Under the terms of this agreement, Ms. Ireland also serves in the non-executive positions as our Chairman Emeritus and Chief Brand Strategist. Under the September 2017 amendment to the agreement, the parties also granted each other certain rights for opportunities introduced by one party to the other, including rights of first refusal and the payment of referral fees; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | In January 2017 I’M1 entered into an exclusive, royalty-free 10 year wholesale worldwide license agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide for rights to use, assign and sublease certain trademarks, including I’M1, to allow for the manufacturing, marketing and sale of products bearing those marks and to sublicense certain of these rights; 
• | In February 2017, we entered into one year advisory agreements with each of Mr. Stephen Roseberry and Mr. Tommy Meharey pursuant to which they provide advisory and consulting services to us, including serving as co-Managing Directors of I’M1, devoting such time to our business as we mutually determine. Mr. Roseberry is President and a member of the board of directors of kathy ireland ® Worldwide and Mr. Meharey is Vice President and a member of the board of directors of kathy ireland ® Worldwide. Mr. Jon Carrasco, who is the Global Creative Director for kathy ireland® Worldwide, also serves as Global Creative Director for I’M1, and he is responsible for developing and facilitating creative strategies for I’M1 under the terms of a one year advisory agreement entered into in September 2017. We expect these agreements will be renewed for multi-year terms prior to the expiration of the terms of the current agreements; 
• | In February 2017 we also entered into one year advisory agreements with each of Mr. Roseberry and Mr. Nic Mendoza pursuant to which they provide advisory and consulting services to us, including serving as co-Managing Directors of EE1, devoting such time to our business as we mutually determine. Mr. Mendoza is Vice President of kathy ireland ® Worldwide. Mr. Carrasco also serves as Global Creative Director of EE1, and he is responsible for the development and facilitation of creative strategies for EE1 under the terms of a one year advisory agreement entered into in September 2017. We also expect these agreements will be renewed for multi-year terms prior to the expiration of the terms of the current agreements; and 
• | In September 2017 we entered into a seven year wholesale license agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide under which we were granted an exclusive, royalty free right to license, assign and use the kathy ireland® Health & Wellness™ trademark, and all trade names, trademarks and service marks related to the intellectual property including any derivatives or modifications, goodwill associated with this intellectual property when used in conjunction with health and wellness as well as Ms. Ireland's likeness, videos, photographs and other visual representations connected with kathy ireland® Health & Wellness™. As compensation under this agreement, we agreed to pay kathy ireland® Worldwide a marketing fee of $840,000, of which $480,000 has been paid to date, together with a royalty of 33 1/3% of our net proceeds under any sublicense agreements we may enter into for this intellectual property. We have the right to renew this license agreement for an additional three year period by paying an additional marketing fee of $360,000.


 
 The foregoing agreements are material to our ability to conduct our business. The material terms of these agreements are described later in this report under Note 9 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, in January 2017 we acquired our ownership interests in both I'M1 and EE1 from an entity controlled by principals of kathy ireland® Worldwide and their affiliates. The material terms of these transactions are described later in this report under Item 1. Our Business – Our History and Note 2 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
  
  Our business units
  
  Licensing division
  
 I’M1's goal is to become a leader in multiple categories including grooming, personal care, cologne, accessories, jewelry and apparel. I’M1 markets itself as a lifestyle brand for men, who are not threatened by change

  and willingly embrace it. Our target customers are men who enjoy a lifestyle inspired by the rugged chic of an athletic lifestyle, while giving back to our communities by supporting our Millennium Development Goals.
  
 Tommy Meharey is the “face” of I’M1. He is a millennial, Marine, father, and the youngest board member of kathy ireland® Worldwide. We believe Mr. Meharey embodies the essence of the targeted I’M1 clientele, and his approachable nature, history of service to the nation, and family values may be an asset to the brand. As the voice and inspiration of I’M1, we expect to leverage Mr. Meharey’s ability to communicate the DNA of I’M1 to the media, retailers, and our consumers.
  
 Since our January 2017 acquisition of the voting interests in this newly formed entity from affiliates of kathy ireland® Worldwide, we have entered into licensing agreements with a number of entities in our target categories including men’s fashion and accessories. We believe that building a powerful brand is a dynamic way to give companies an edge in increasingly competitive markets. I’M1’s brand identity goal is to seek to construct lasting relationships with men who wish to elevate their lives, through the purchases they make by developing quality products that they need as a part of their day to day lives. Our current licensing agreements provide that the manufacturing, development, distribution and operating costs and expenses of products are borne by our licensee, and we expect that licensing agreements we enter into with future partners will be similarly structured. Our licensing agreements provide for revenues based on royalties as a percentage of sales by our client and are usually signed for an initial five to seven year period. The contracts typically also have a minimum annual guaranteed royalty amount and can also have an advertising/marketing fee which is paid to us.
  
 We have developed a standardized form of licensing agreement for use by I'M1 which contains general terms and conditions under which we will grant licenses to the I'M1 marks that can be modified to meet the business terms of each particular product. The standard terms and conditions include the limitations on the grant of the license for the marks, use and ownership of our intellectual property and the ownership of the intellectual property related to the licensed products, means for conducting brand business and coordinating with us and other licensees, royalty reporting and accounting obligations, quality assurance procedures, acceptable display, labeling and promotional materials, minimum insurance requirements, termination and confidentiality provisions, a code of conduct for our licensees and other customary terms and conditions contained in licensing agreements.
  
 We have also entered into two joint advisory agreements with EE1. When the advisory services under a brand management agreement with a client would span the services particular to both divisions, specifically where our men’s lifestyle brand can add additional value to a client regarding men’s modeling, targeting channels or influencers that overlap with our Licensing division, both of our subsidiaries will be a party to the agreement with the client.
  
 In addition we plan to license our Beauty & Pin-Ups, I’M1 and EE1 brands to both manufacturing and direct-to-retail licensees. In a traditional license, a manufacturer is granted rights, at times on an exclusive basis, to a single or small group of related product categories for a particular item for sale to multiple accounts within an approved channel of distribution and territory. In a direct-to-retail license, a single retailer is granted the right (typically on an exclusive basis) to sell branded products in a broad range of product categories through its brick and mortar stores and e-commerce sites.
  
  Entertainment division
  
 EE1 provides brand management and seeks to be an experiential entertainment company, serving as a producer and marketer of multiple entertainment distribution platforms.
  
  Brand management
  
 Under the scope of its brand management services, EE1 provides input, strategies and an architecture for corporate brands, including:
  
 
• | content creation and promotion through social and standard media;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
• | marketing input; 
• | assisting with influencer marketing programs; 


 
   
7


  
 
 
• | providing production capability for video and photo support for brand advertising; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | assisting with brand extension through licensing opportunities. 


 
 Since our January 2017 acquisition of the voting interests in EE1 from affiliates of kathy ireland® Worldwide, we have entered into representation and advisory agreements with a number of entities to provide the services above. In these agreements, we will typically provide a variety of strategic services designed to help expand, establish, or reposition a brand. The services are delivered over a defined timeframe for a contracted fee. In addition we typically receive an on-going royalty fee, for a negotiated period of time, of sales by the client.
  
 In addition to the representation and advisory agreements to which EE1 is a party, we also entered into seven year non-exclusive wholesale license agreements with two existing brands introduced to us by kathy ireland® Worldwide. Under the terms of these agreements, we have the right to use, assign and sublicense the marks, intellectual property and other rights in connection with the brands for the purpose of entering into sublicense agreements with third parties for the manufacture, marketing and sale of products utilizing these marks.
  
  Experiential Entertainment
  
 Experiential entertainment is also part of EE1's business model. EE1’s goal is to provide a variety of “all inclusive” entertainment experiences targeted to millennials which combine multiple facets of an entertainment experience into one event. EE1 is expected to be able to assess all entertainment distribution platforms such as recording, film, television, radio, podcasts, web content, live events including: sports, festivals, fashion shows, holiday-centric programming, and business-centric programming, to identify areas of additional opportunity. EE1 intends to pursue opportunities to build content in every area of the entertainment, sports, and travel industries - including joining artists in the recording studio, participating in an artist’s sound check, VIP back stage artist meet and greets, films, broadcast, live events including concerts and musical theatre, and fashion shows.
  
 EE1 is a party to agreements with several entities for projects including a record album and production services related to two television shows featuring Kathy Ireland. These agreements are structured based on the type of entertainment or event produced and will provide revenue as a fee based on the services contracted and provided. In some cases, we will also receive on-going royalties based on sales (for example, album and movie sales).
  
  kathy ireland® Health & Wellness
  
 As a result of Ms. Ireland's five best selling fitness programs and her personal focus on health and wellness, we expect to develop a new brand utilizing these rights. Through licensing arrangements with third parties which we will seek to obtain, our goal is to create a brand which will include a wide variety of licensed products and services, targeted to both Baby Boomers as well as millennials. We believe that licensed products and services under this brand can benefit from a wide distribution path of grocery, drug and mass, as well as direct response and online sales. Our target market sectors for this brand include: complementary and alternative medicine; wellness lifestyle; real estate; spa industry; thermal/mineral springs; workplace wellness; beauty at every age; healthy eating; nutrition and weight loss; wellness tourism; fitness and mind-body; and preventive and personalized medicine. Our business plan for this brand, however, is in its preliminary stages and there are no assurances we will be successful in developing this brand concept or entering into agreements for licensed products.
  
  Professional products division
  
 Beauty & Pin-Ups is designed to be an innovative and cutting-edge producer and marketer of quality hair care and other beauty products. It has a brand name that we believe lends itself to various channels of distribution and licensing including swimsuits, cosmetics, nails, accessories and more. With an initial launch in September 2015 of “The Iron”, a unique styling tool, Beauty & Pin-Ups currently has 11 products, including:
  
 
• | Flaunt- Silkening Shampoo and Conditioner | • | Linger - Style and Sculpting Spray Gel
--+---------------------------------------------------+---+---------------------------------------
• | Luxe - Leave-in Spray On Revitalizing Conditioner | • | Fierce - Firm Hold Finishing Spray 
• | Lavish - All in 1 Cleansing and Conditioning | • | Fearless Hair Rescue Treatment

• | Sway - Blow Out Styling Primer Enhanced with Marine Botanicals | • | Valor - Superfine Hair Spray 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------+---+---------------------------------
• | Fever - Thermal Protectant | • | Rewind - Shampoo and Conditioner
• | Stay Dirty - Dry Shampoo | | 


 
 Beauty & Pin-Ups uses healthy, lavish ingredients in stylist-tested formulas. All of the products are cruelty free – (not tested on animals), paraben, phthalate and sulfate free. We are just as proud of what is not in our products as what is in them. We believe that the result is beautiful, healthy hair. We believe that the brand is unique in its packaging with classic pin-up imagery on the bottles that are designed to create a feel of affordable luxury with a vintage, yet modern feel. Our mission of beauty with a purpose is inspired by the pin-up who was a symbol of empowerment… women who were comfortable in their own skin and defined femininity, yet had a fierce independence and confidence.
  
  Marketing
  
 We have an internal team that manages and facilitates our social media presence and strategy which strives to appeal to a wide audience with positive messaging that embraces inner beauty and authenticity. Through high quality visual imagery that engages both the consumer and the stylist, we seek to convey our message that beauty belongs to everyone. We use a mix of sales messaging, ingredient stories, giveaways/contests, and images of hairstyles to engage customers and increase reach. Our marketing messages and social media messages are complementary to each other; however social media is used as much more of a story telling platform. We aim to be a destination for both the consumer and the stylist to acquire knowledge about the latest styles and trends in the industry, and to be inspired. 
  
 We seek to build our brand through our websites, trade shows, television, digital, and social media. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products not only in traditional media, but increasingly in digital and social media, leveraging significant opportunities for amplification.
  
 We believe there are marketing opportunities and brand extensions including swimwear, sunglasses and intimate apparel utilizing the Beauty & Pin-Ups tradename that we may be able to take advantage of in future periods. While we have engaged in early stage discussions with third parties regarding these possible marketing opportunities and brand extensions, we have not entered into any agreements as of the date of this report.
  
  Product development
  
 Mr. Priel Maman, formerly the minority owner of Beauty & Pin-Ups, was the developer of the original Beauty & Pin-Ups product line. In our acquisition of the assets of Beauty & Pin-Ups in 2015 we acquired all of the intellectual property associated with those development efforts. Our products are conceptualized by our in-house team and utilizing the services of third party contractors the product formulas are then developed, tested and finalized. The research and development expense portion of the fees included in the amounts paid to third party contractors were approximately $32,825 and $36,750 in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Concurrently a third party contractor also assists also our in-house team in packaging design and development and production of marketing materials.
  
  Sales channels
  
 Beauty & Pin-Ups products have historically been sold primarily through Beauty Systems Group under a purchase order arrangement. Beauty Systems Group has approximately 1,265 stores nationwide, including over 150 franchise stores, and is one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in North America, with almost 1,000 consultants. We also distribute our products under purchase order arrangements with Paramount Beauty Distributing Associates, Inc. AMLP, BSG Canada, and recently online through JCPenney.com. Historically, we have been materially dependent upon Beauty Systems Group for sales of our Beauty & Pin-Ups products.
  
 By the end of calendar year 2017, our goal was to expand our sales channels to multiple channels of beauty distribution, including wholesale and professional chain salon distribution as well as through additional e-commerce channels including from on our website. In furtherance of this goal, entering fiscal 2018 we have entered into five
  
   
9


  
 
 year distribution agreements with East Coast Enterprises, Inc., a distributor of beauty supply products in the northeast of the United States and with Century Beauty Supply, a distributor in Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana. We are continuing to focus on extending our distributor channel across the United States.
  
 Beauty & Pin-Ups is currently developing a North American sales support team to build sales for the brand with its distribution partners. This group is expected to cover all regions of the United States. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we hired a regional sales manager and as of December 1, 2017 we have hired 12 independent sales representatives.
  
  Manufacturing, warehousing and raw materials
  
 We manufacture our core products for Beauty & Pin-Ups through hair care and other third-party manufacturers in the United States and Canada; our flat iron products, foil pods for the irons, and promotional items (back packs, zipper bags, and clutch purses) are manufactured by third parties in China on a purchase order basis. Terms with our China-based manufacturers typically require 30% to 50% upon order with payment due when products are ready to ship.  We expect to continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment and reduce costs.
  
 The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our core products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. We have engagements with specific organizations that are our “fillers”; they use the formulas provided to create the products and fill our packaging so we have a product that can be distributed to our customers. Our terms typically provide that upon an order being completed by the filler, balances are due within 30 to 45 days, although in some instances we have been required to place a deposit of 30% to 50% upon placement of an order.
  
 We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications using our unique brand image. We utilize a third party firm that specializes in design and rollout of packaging, labeling, merchandising displays and advertising for our products.
  
 We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market and reducing costs. In addition, we source within the region of manufacturing to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies. To date, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.
  
  Government regulation
  
 We and our products are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and, at such time as we expand our distribution outside the United States, the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products may be sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, shipment, disposal and safety of our products. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries’ rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.
  
 We have engaged a third party that specializes in regulation in our industry to advise us and provide regulatory consulting services and regulatory and technical support for our product offering in the United States, Canada and Europe. At such time as we are successful in expanding our distribution network outside the United States, we will also be subject to the laws of the countries in which are products are imported and sold. We expect to expand our engagement of this third party to include these additional countries.
  
  Intellectual property rights
  
 In addition to our license agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide described elsewhere in this report, our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our brand names. We rely on a combination of trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements) to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
  
 We own the trademark rights used in connection with our brands in the United States including Beauty & Pin-Ups and EE1 and have a 10 year license for rights to the I’M1 trademark. We have also filed trademark
  
   
10


  
 
 registrations for an additional approximately 12 trademarks which we may use in the future as we launch new products under the Beauty & Pin-Ups product line or enter into licensing agreements for Beauty & Pin-Ups, I’M1 and EE1. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.
  
 We own both U.S., European Union and Chinese design patents on our hair iron titled “hair iron” and have filed application in the U.S., Europe and China for design patents for the hair foil, titled “aluminum foil for hair” under the Chinese application and “hair foil” under the U.S. and European Union application. This product is used in conjunction with the hair iron.
  
 In connection with the recording master license agreement with McCoo & Davis, Inc. EE1 will own all intellectual property rights in the album, any videos, production elements and the master recordings and in all other forms of media, with the right to sublicense.
  
 In addition to www.levelbrands.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.
  
  Competition
  
 I’M1’s competition includes established, well-capitalized companies with wide consumer recognition such as Armani, Ferragamo, Prada, Burberry, and Gucci as well as newer brands including Gilt, Me Undies, Uniqlo, Concepts, Roden and Grey, Machus, Far Fetch and The Corner. I’M1 is expected to be a younger brand, built to address the desires of millennials. While we expect we will seek to address the aspirations of our customers at attainable price points which we believe may give us a competitive advantage, there are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete within this sector.
  
 EE1's principal competitors in the entertainment arena are expected to be large, established multi-national companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Bertelsmann Group, Comcast (owners of Universal, NBC, Telemundo), and 20th Century Fox. Additional competitive organizations include independent studios, though the majority of these agencies do not address consumers across multiple platforms. Despite the significant competition in the entertainment industry from larger, established and well-capitalized companies, we believe it is a field that welcomes, and is in fact driven, by disruption and we will seek to leverage the flexibility of a start-up without a large organizational structure to our advantage. There are no assurances, however, that we will ever be successful in effectively competing in this market segment.
  
 There is vigorous competition within each market where our hair care and other beauty products are sold. Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and the pace and timing of new product introductions also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions. We compete against a number of national and international companies, most of which have substantially greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of hair care and other beauty products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. They include, among others, L’Oreal Professional, Matrix Essentials, Redken, Paul Mitchell, Sebastian and Schwartzkopf. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have developed their own beauty brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours. There are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete or that we will develop any widespread brand recognition.
  
  Employees
  
 At December 13, 2017 we had 11 full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.

 RISKS RELATED TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS
  
  Kathy Ireland is not an officer or director of our company. We are materially dependent upon our relationships with kathy ireland® Worldwide and certain of its affiliates. If these advisory agreements or license rights should be terminated or expire, we would be deprived of the services and our business could be materially adversely

  impacted.
  
 While affiliates of kathy ireland® Worldwide are minority owners of both I’M1 and EE1, the terms of the operating agreements for those subsidiaries do not require them to provide any services to us. We have entered into a non-exclusive advisory agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide, as amended, which expires in February 2025 under which we engaged it to provide various consulting and advisory services to us. Ms. Ireland serves in the non-executive role of Chairman Emeritus and Chief Brand Strategist to us under this agreement. Ms. Ireland is not a member of our management or board of directors, the title Chairman Emeritus is an honorary title and she is not a founder or co-founder of our company. Ms. Ireland provides services to us solely under the terms of the non exclusive advisory agreement. We have also entered into advisory agreements with additional affiliates of kathy ireland® Worldwide, including Messrs. Roseberry, Carrasco, Meharey and Mendoza, pursuant to which they provide various management and advisory services to us, including key operational roles at I’M1 and EE1. These agreements, which expire between February 2018 and September 2018, are expected to be renewed under similar terms prior to the expiration date. None of these services are provided on an exclusive basis, each of these individuals may have a conflict of interest in that they have a long term relationship with Kathy Ireland and have derived substantial income from kathy ireland® Worldwide and there is no minimum number of hours which are required to be devoted to us. In addition we have obtained a royalty free right to license the intellectual property related to kathy ireland® Health & Wellness. Our business model is materially dependent upon our continued relationship with kathy ireland® Worldwide, Ms. Ireland and her affiliates, including Messrs. Roseberry, Carrasco, Meharey and Mendoza. If we should lose access to those relationships or if the reputation of Ms. Ireland and/or kathy ireland® Worldwide were to be damaged, our results would suffer and there are no assurances we would be able to continue to operate our company and develop our brands as presently planned.
  
  Our limited operating history does not afford investors a sufficient history on which to base an investment decision.
  
 Level Brands was formed in March 2015. During fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 our net sales were solely from our professional products division. We began reporting revenues from our licensing division and our entertainment division during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In September 2017, we entered into wholesale license agreements for three new brands, including kathy ireland® Health & Wellness, a newly created brand. There are no assurances we will be successful in generating net sales in future periods based upon these new agreements. Our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that are frequently encountered in a newly-formed company. There can be no assurance that at this time that we will successfully implement our business plan, operate profitably or will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due. Prospective investors must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies, particularly in rapidly evolving markets. We cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations.
  
  Our subsidiaries I’M1 and EE1 are new entities with a limited operating history and we recently entered into a license agreement licensing the rights to certain intellectual property related to kathy ireland ® Health & Wellness, a newly created brand with no operating history, which does not afford investors a sufficient history on our company which to base an investment decision.
  
 I’M1 and EE1 are entities formed in September 2016 and March 2016, respectively. We acquired membership interests in each of these entities in January 2017. Both entities are in the early stages of their businesses and we began reporting revenues from each of these subsidiaries operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. In September 2017 we entered into an exclusive license agreement to license the trademark and intellectual property rights for kathy ireland® Health & Wellness, a newly created brand with no operations. We do not know when we may begin reporting revenues from this business unit. Our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that are frequently encountered in a newly-formed company. There can be no assurance that at this time that we will operate profitably or will have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due. Prospective investors must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies, particularly in rapidly evolving markets. We cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks. In the event that we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be
  
   
13


  
 
 materially and adversely affected and we may not have the resources to continue or expand our business operations.
  
  We have a history of losses and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in future periods.
  
 We reported net losses to common shareholders of $1,738,734 and $3,356,489 for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Until such time, if ever, that we are successful in generating profits which are sufficient to pay our operating expenses it is likely we will continue to report losses in future periods. Further, historically our revenues have been attributable to sales from our professional products division and we did not begin reporting revenues from either our licensing division or our entertainment division until the second quarter of fiscal 2017. There are no assurances we will generate substantial revenues from the new businesses or that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to report profitable operations or a net profit.
  
  If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.
  
 As described later in this report, our management has determined that, as of September 30, 2017, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 2013 Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. While we have never been required to restate our consolidated financial statements and expect to remediate the material weakness during fiscal 2018, the existence of the continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting increases the risk that a future restatement of our consolidated financials is possible.
  
  The terms of the various agreements between our company and kathy ireland® Worldwide contain termination provisions which may impact management's ability to make certain decisions regarding the operation of our company.
  
 The master advisory and consulting agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide on which we are materially dependent provides that the agreement is immediately terminable by kathy ireland® Worldwide if any officers are terminated or resign, including Mr. Roseberry in his role as President and co-Managing Director of I'M1 and EE1, or if additional officers are appointed for each I'M1 and EE1 without the consent of kathy ireland® Worldwide. The wholesale license agreement for kathy ireland® Health & Wellness™ contains the right of kathy ireland® Worldwide to immediately terminate it if any officers are terminated or removed or additional officers are appointed with respect to either I'M1 or EE1, or if we compete with or invest in business that compete with kathy ireland® Worldwide. We believe our relationship with kathy ireland® Worldwide and its affiliates is good. It is possible, however, that our management's ability to make certain operational decisions which it believes are otherwise in the best interests of our company could be restricted in future periods if these decisions could result in triggering the rights of kathy ireland® Worldwide to terminate any agreement.
  
  Our business depends on consumer spending patterns.
  
 Our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments, the levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence. Reduced consumer spending on beauty products could have an adverse effect on our operating results in future periods.
  
  Substantially all of our net sales have been to a limited number of customers, the loss of any of which would be materially adverse to our company.
  
 Substantially all of our net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016 were attributable to sales to a limited number of customers. There are no assurances sales to these customers will continue. While we expect to add additional customers to our distribution network in the future for our professional products division, and expand our licensing and consulting clients in our other divisions, until such time as we are successful in these efforts, of which there is no assurance, any significant decrease in sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse financial effect on our company.
  
   
14


  
 
  A significant amount of our net sales were from customers who are identified as related parties, the loss of any of which would be materially adverse to our company.
  
 A significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2017, totaling $1,731,238, were from customers who are identified as related parties. There are no assurances sales to these customers will continue. While we expect to add additional customers in all of our businesses as we expand our licensing and consulting clients, until such time as we are successful in these efforts, of which there is no assurance, any significant decrease in sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse financial effect on our company.
  
  If we fail to promote and maintain our brands in the market, our businesses, operating results, financial condition, and our ability to attract customers will be materially adversely affected.
  
 Our success depends on our ability to create and maintain brand awareness for our product offerings. This may require a significant amount of capital to allow us to market our products and establish brand recognition and customer loyalty. Additionally, many of the companies offering similar products have already established their brand identity within the marketplace. We can offer no assurances that we will be successful in establishing awareness of our brands allowing us to compete in this market. The importance of brand recognition will continue to increase because low barriers of entry to the industries in which we operate may result in an increased number of direct competitors. To promote our brands, we may be required to continue to increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining brand awareness. We may not generate a corresponding increase in revenue to justify these costs.
  
  If we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands and trademarks, our growth may be limited, and, even if additional trademarks are acquired, we may not realize anticipated benefits due to integration or licensing difficulties.
  
 A component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional brands and trademarks. We generally compete with traditional apparel and consumer brand companies, other brand management companies and private equity groups for brand acquisitions. However, as more of our competitors continue to pursue our brand management model, competition for specific acquisition targets may become more acute, acquisitions may become more expensive and suitable acquisition candidates could become more difficult to find. In addition, even if we successfully acquire additional trademarks or the rights to use additional trademarks, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that justify our investment in, or realize planned benefits with respect to, those additional brands.
  
 Although we seek to temper our acquisition risks by following acquisition guidelines relating to the existing strength of the brand, its diversification benefits to us, its potential licensing scale and credit worthiness of the licensee base, acquisitions, whether they be of additional intellectual property (“IP”) assets or of the companies that own them, entail numerous risks, any of which could detrimentally affect our results of operations.
  
 Acquisition of brands or trademarks transactions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management’s attention from running our existing business; unanticipated costs associated with the target acquisition, appropriately valuing the target acquisition and analyzing its marketability, increased expenses, including legal and administrative expenses; integration costs related to the customer base and business practices of the acquired company with our own; and adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill associated with acquisitions.
  
 When we acquire IP assets or the companies that own them, our due diligence reviews are subject to inherent uncertainties and may not reveal all potential risks. Although we generally attempt to seek contractual protections through representations, warranties and indemnities, we cannot be sure that we will obtain such provisions in our acquisitions or that such provisions will fully protect us from all unknown, contingent or other liabilities or costs. Finally, claims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not, or may not be able to, indemnify us or that may exceed the scope, duration or amount of the seller’s indemnification obligations.
  
 No assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or financial or business effect of any possible transaction. As a result, there is no guarantee that our shareholders will achieve greater returns as a result of any future acquisitions we complete.

  Each of our I'M1 and EE1 subsidiaries are governed by operating agreements that require us to distribute amounts to minority members in certain circumstances. These distributions could reduce the amount of operating capital we have in future periods.
  
 Under the terms of the operating agreements for each of I’M1 and EE1, Level Brands as the manager of these entities is responsible for the operations, including the payment of the operating costs. These costs are then deducted from the “profits” of the entity and a portion of those amounts, as determined by the particular operating agreement, will then be distributed to the members. We own all of the voting interests in I'M1 and EE1. During fiscal 2017 EE1 made a distribution to its members. Distributions to the members of I'M1 and EE1 will reduce the amount of working capital available to us and could adversely impact our liquidity in future periods.
  
  The value of the equity securities we may accept as compensation under consulting agreements will be subject to adjustment which could result in losses to us in future periods. By accepting equity securities as partial compensation for our services, we may be adversely impacting our working capital in future periods.
  
 As described elsewhere herein, in March 2017 I'M1 entered into a consulting agreement with a third party under which we accepted shares of its common stock as partial compensation for the services to be provided. In May 2017 as compensation under the terms of an advisory agreement I'M1 and EE1 received a warrant to purchase shares of the third party’s stock which was exercised in June 2017. Since then we have entered into similar agreements with additional clients and it is possible we may enter into similar arrangements with other third parties. By accepting equity securities as partial compensation for our services in lieu of cash, we will be incurring expenses to deliver the services without the corresponding cash payments from our clients. As such, we will be utilizing a greater portion of our working capital to provide services with the hope that we may benefit from an increase in the market value of the equity securities we have received in future periods. In addition, these securities will be reflected on our balance sheets in future periods as “marketable securities” or “investment other securities”. At the end of each quarter, we will evaluate the carrying value of the marketable securities or investment other securities for a decrease in value. We will evaluate the company underlying these marketable securities or investment other securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary. If the decline in fair value is judged to be “other- than- temporary”, the cost basis of the individual security will be written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write-down is charged to earnings. As a result of these policies, it is possible that we may recognize impairments on the carrying value of these securities in future periods. Any future impairments would adversely affect our operating results for the corresponding periods in that we would be required to reduce the carrying value of these investments.
  
  We may be unable to liquidate securities we accept as partial compensation under consulting agreements which could adversely impact our liquidity in future periods.
  
 Our ability to sell any securities we accept as partial compensation under consulting agreements is dependent upon a number of factors, including the existence of a liquid market for the securities and our compliance with the resale provisions of Federal securities laws which require us to hold the shares for at least six months, among other factors. While we expect to generally accept securities from issuers who are publicly traded or who are expecting to become a publicly traded company, there are no assurances a liquid market will exist in such securities at such time as we are able to resell the shares, or that the price we may receive will be commensurate with the value of the services we are providing. In that event, we would not benefit from the expected rise in the market price of the securities we own as a result of our efforts on behalf of the client company. In addition, depending upon the terms of our business relationship with the issuer of the securities, it is possible that from time to time we could be in possession of non-public information regarding the issuer which could prohibit us from disposing of the shares at a time when it is advantageous to us to do so. If we are unable to readily liquidate any securities we accept as compensation, we would be deprived of the cash value of those services and we would be required to write-off the carrying value of the securities which could adversely impact our results of operations in future periods.
  
  The Investment Company Act of 1940 will limit the value of securities we can accept as payment for our business consulting services which may limit our future revenues.
  
 We have accepted securities as partial payment for consulting services to be rendered by I'M1 and may do so again in the future, but only to the extent that it does not cause us to become classified as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Although we do not believe we are engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, and we do not currently hold ourselves out to the public as being
  
   
16


  
 
 engaged in those activities, it is possible that we may be deemed to be an “inadvertent investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “ICA”, if more than 40% of our future income and/or more than 40% of our assets are derived from “investment securities” (as defined in the ICA), and if we are deemed to be, or perceived to be, primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. If we were deemed or found to be an investment company by the SEC or a court of law, then we would face significant consequences and additional regulatory obligations. For example, registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulation relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. If it were established that we are an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties with whom we have contracts could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. To the extent that we are required to reduce the amount of securities we may accept as payment for consulting services to avoid becoming an investment company, our ability to maximize our future revenues from consulting arrangements with potential licensees may be adversely impacted.
  
  We may require additional capital to finance the acquisition of additional brands and if we are unable to raise such capital on beneficial terms or at all this could restrict our growth.
  
 We may, in the future, require additional capital to help fund all or part of potential acquisitions. If, at the time required, we do not have sufficient cash to finance those additional capital needs, we will need to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing. We cannot guarantee that, if and when needed, additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Further, if additional capital is needed and is either unavailable or cost prohibitive, our growth may be limited as we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of our expansion plans. In addition, any additional financing we undertake could impose additional covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility, and, if we issue equity securities to raise capital or as acquisition consideration, our existing shareholders may experience dilution or the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock.
  
  RISKS RELATED TO OUR LICENSING AND ENTERTAINMENT DIVISIONS
   AND OUR HEALTH & WELLNESS BRAND
  
  We are materially dependent upon the wholesale license agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide. If this agreement were to be terminated, we would be unable to continue to operate I’M1.
  
 In January 2017, I’M1 entered into a 10 year wholesale license agreement with kathy ireland® Worldwide under which we were granted exclusive royalty free rights to certain marks and tradenames associated with the I’M1 brand. This agreement may be immediately terminated upon notice to us if I’M1 terminates, removes or replaces officers, if we cease to be the manager of I’M1 or if we compete with or invest in a business that competes with kathy ireland® Worldwide. The restriction on competition against kathy ireland® Worldwide may limit our ability to enter into licensing agreements in the future for products which could impact our revenues in future periods. If kathy ireland® Worldwide should terminate this wholesale license agreement, our ability to operate I’M1 under that brand name would cease and, depending upon the amount of revenues we are then recognizing from that brand, our results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be materially adversely impacted.
  
  We may never generate any significant royalties under the terms of the wholesale license agreements with either Nicholas Walker or Andre Carthen.
  
 In September 2017, we entered into non-exclusive wholesale license agreements with two parties, each of which have a preexisting relationship with kathy ireland® Worldwide. We have agreed to pay each of the licensors certain amounts as consideration for these agreements in the form of cash and equity. We will incur certain additional costs in our efforts to attract and secure additional licensed products for each of these licensors. Our future compensation, if any, will be in the form of royalties. In order for these non-exclusive wholesale license agreements to provide an economic benefit to our company, we will need to generate consistent, meaningful royalties from products sold or manufactured using the marks of these licensors. There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to attract sub-licensees or that the costs incurred in these efforts will not exceed royalties received from these agreements.
  
   
17


  
 
  The failure of our licensees to adequately produce, market, import and sell products bearing our brand names in their license categories, continue their operations, renew their license agreements or pay their obligations under their license agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations.
  
 Our future revenues from our licensing division will be substantially dependent on royalty payments made to us under our license agreements, in addition to compensation under any consulting agreements we may enter into with the third parties for services by either our licensing division, our entertainment division, or both. The failure of our licensees to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, or their inability to operate successfully or at all, could result in their breach and/or the early termination of such agreements, their non-renewal of such agreements or our decision to amend such, thereby eliminating some or all of that stream of revenue. It is possible that the milestones to be met under the terms of licensing agreements may never be achieved which also could deprive us of additional revenues. There can be no assurances that we will not lose the licensees under our license agreements due to their failure to exercise the option to renew or extend the term of those agreements or the cessation of their business operations (as a result of their financial difficulties or otherwise) without equivalent options for replacement. Any of such failures could reduce the anticipated revenue stream to be generated by the license agreements. In addition, the failure of our licensees to meet their production, manufacturing and distribution requirements, or to be able to continue to import goods (including, without limitation, as a result of labor strikes or unrest), could cause a decline in their sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments (over and above any guaranteed minimums) due to us.  Further, the failure of our licensees and/or their third party manufacturers, which we do not control, to adhere to local laws, industry standards and practices generally accepted in the United States in areas of worker safety, worker rights of association, social compliance, and general health and welfare, could result in accidents and practices that cause disruptions or delays in production and/or substantial harm to the reputation of our brands, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  A weak economy or softness in certain sectors including apparel, consumer products, retail and entertainment could exacerbate this risk. This, in turn, could decrease our potential revenues and cash flows.
  
  From time to time we may compete with kathy ireland Worldwide® in securing advisory or representation agreements with potential clients for EE1 which may create a conflict of interests for the managing directors of EE1.
  
 kathy ireland® Worldwide is an established company which has significant experience in assisting companies in the promotion and management of their brands through licensing and advisory agreements. Affiliates of kathy ireland® Worldwide are responsible for the day to day operations of EE1 and kathy ireland® Worldwide. Part of EE1's business competes with kathy ireland ®Worldwide in identifying and securing clients for its advisory services. For example, both EE1 and kathy ireland ®Worldwide are parties to substantial identical representation agreements with Dada Media, Inc. and David Tutera. These affiliates will be able to determine which entity, either kathy ireland® Worldwide or EE1, is referred to the potential client. kathy ireland® Worldwide has more experience and resources and there are no assurances that conflicts of interest which may arise will be resolved in our favor. As a result, it is possible that we may lose out on potential business opportunities.
  
  We could become a party to litigation involving our licensed products which could result in additional costs to us. Certain licensed products may be more likely to lead to product liability lawsuits than others, which could expose us to additional unknown risks.
  
 Although we are not responsible for the manufacturing, sale or distribution of licensed products, it is possible our company could be named as a defendant in litigation related to licensed products. Certain licensed products may, by virtue of the industry in which they are sold and the governmental regulations to which they are subject, such as vaping products, could be more likely to be the subject of litigation than others. Notwithstanding that our standard form of license agreements requires the licensee to indemnify us against ligation involving the licensed products and to maintain product liability insurance policies, it is possible that a licensee may fail to maintain this coverage during the term of the license agreement. While we would then have a right to terminate the license agreement as a result of this breach of its terms, there are no assurances we would not be required to expend significant funds and management time defending our company in any potential product liability insurance claim. There are no assurances that we would prevail in any such litigation, which could subject us to judgments and costs of settlements which could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations in future periods.
  
  As a result of the intense competition within our targeted licensees’ markets and the strength of some of their competitors, we and our licensees may not be able to compete successfully.
  
   
18


  
 
 Many of our targeted trademark licenses are for products in the apparel, fashion accessories, footwear, beauty and fragrance, home products and décor, consumer electronics and entertainment industries in which licensees face intense competition from third party brands and licensees. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition and service. In addition, various fads and the limited availability of shelf space could affect competition for our licensees’ products. Many of our licensees’ competitors have greater financial, importation, distribution, marketing and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brand names. Our licensees may be unable to compete successfully in the markets for their products, and we may not be able to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.
  
  Our business is dependent on market acceptance of our brands and the potential future products of our licensees bearing these brands.
  
 Although some of our targeted licensees might have guaranteed minimum net sales and minimum royalties to us, a failure of our brands or of products bearing our brands to achieve or maintain market acceptance could cause a reduction of our licensing revenue and could further cause existing licensees not to renew their agreements. Such failure could also cause the devaluation of our trademarks, which are our primary intellectual property, or “IP”, assets, making it more difficult for us to renew our current licenses upon their expiration or enter into new or additional licenses for our trademarks. In addition, if such devaluation of our trademarks were to occur, a material impairment in the carrying value of one or more of our trademarks could also occur and be charged as an expense to our operating results.
  
 The industries in which we target to compete, including the apparel industry, are subject to rapidly evolving trends and competition. In addition, consumer tastes change rapidly. The licensees under our licensing agreements may not be able to anticipate, gauge or respond to such changes in a timely manner. Failure of our licensees to anticipate, identify and capitalize on evolving trends could result in declining sales of our brands and devaluation of our trademarks. Continued and substantial marketing efforts, which may, from time to time, also include our expenditure of significant additional funds to keep pace with changing consumer demands, are required to maintain market acceptance of the licensees’ products and to create market acceptance of new products and categories of products bearing our trademarks; however, these expenditures may not result in either increased market acceptance of, or licenses for, our trademarks or increased market acceptance, or sales, of our licensees’ products. Furthermore, while we believe that we currently maintain sufficient control over the products our licensees’ produce under our brand names through the provision of trend direction and our right to preview and approve a majority of such products, including their presentation and packaging, we do not actually design or manufacture products bearing our marks, and therefore, have more limited control over such products’ quality and design than would a traditional product manufacturer.
  
  RISKS RELATED TO OUR PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS DIVISION
  
  The majority of our net sales to date in our professional products division are generated on the basis of purchase orders, rather than long term purchase commitments; which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
  
 Our operating history is not long enough to evaluate the likelihood of future cancellations or deferments of customer orders related to product sales in our professional products division. Manufacturers and distributors are currently contracted on a per order basis. The lack of long-term purchase commitments creates a risk that product demand may be reduced if orders are canceled or deferred or, in the event of unanticipated demand, an inability to timely produce and deliver our products. We do not have long-term agreements with our distributors, manufacturers or suppliers and these parties may disrupt or cancel a purchase order or defer or delay shipments of our products at any time. Furthermore, because of our inability to rely on enforceable purchase contracts, and our limited visibility into future customer demand, actual net sales may be different from our forecasts, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
  
  A decline in the price of, or demand for, any of our business services or products, would seriously harm our revenues and operating margins.
  
 Beauty & Pin-Ups accounted for all of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and approximately 22% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. We expect to be reliant on revenues from this division until we are able to begin generating significant revenues and cash flows from our licensing division and/or our entertainment division. Consequently, a
  
   
19


  
 
 decline in the sales of price of, or demand for the Beauty & Pin-Ups product line would seriously harm our business.
  
  The beauty products business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.
  
 We face vigorous competition from companies much larger than ours throughout the world, including multinational consumer product companies. Almost all of these competitors have much greater resources than we do and may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions more quickly than us. Competition in the beauty business is based on pricing of products, innovation, perceived value, service to the consumer, promotional activities, advertising, special events, new product introductions, e-commerce and m-commerce initiatives and other activities. It is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas. Our ability to compete also depends on the continued strength of our brands, our ability to attract and retain key talent and other personnel, the efficiency of our manufacturing facilities and distribution network, and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and those other rights used in our business. As a new company with limited brand recognition, there are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete in our target markets.
  
  We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and/or intellectual property rights licensed to us, and may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims by third parties.
  
 We intend to protect our intellectual property through limited patents and our unpatented trade secrets and know-how through confidentiality or license agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, and by controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, this method may not afford complete protection, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States and unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, processes or technology. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know-how and trade secrets. We are also dependent upon the owners of intellectual property rights licensed to us under various wholesale license agreements to protect and defend those rights against third party claims. If third parties take actions that affect our rights, the value of our intellectual property, similar proprietary rights or reputation or the licensors who have granted us certain rights under wholesale license agreements, or we are unable to protect the intellectual property from infringement or misappropriation, other companies may be able to offer competitive products at lower prices, and we may not be able to effectively compete against these companies. We also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, may require us to:
  
 
● | defend against infringement claims which are expensive and time consuming; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 
● | re-design, re-engineer or re-brand our products or packaging; or 
● | enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.


 
 In the event of claims by third parties for infringement of intellectual property rights we license from third parties under wholesale license agreements, we could be liable for costs of defending allegations of infringement and there are no assurances the licensors will either adequately defend the licensed intellectual property rights or that they would prevail in the related litigation. In that event, we would incur additional costs and may deprived from generating royalties from these agreements.
  
  A disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.
  
 We are subject to the risks inherent in manufacturing our products, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites or suppliers, product quality control, safety, increase in commodity prices and energy costs, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control. If such an event were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

  We are dependent upon suppliers for our raw materials which we purchase on a per order basis without long term contracts and our suppliers are dependent on the continued availability and pricing of raw materials, either of which could negatively affect our ability to manage costs and maintain profitable operating margins.
  
 We currently purchase our raw materials from suppliers with whom we have no written purchase contracts. Any supplier and any order may be terminated or rejected by any supplier at any time. Our reliance on open orders, no preference or assurances from suppliers, and our reliance on these suppliers, creates a risk that our supply of raw materials may be interrupted at any time. We may not be able to timely source another supplier, resulting in delays and decreased sales. There are no assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate stockpiles or that we will be able to acquire and stockpile raw materials at reasonable costs. Our failure to ensure a steady supply of raw material or any significant interruption in the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to timely fulfill orders, resulting in lost orders and revenue.
  
  We rely on third-parties to manufacture and to compound our products, and we have no control over these manufactures and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.
  
 All of our products are manufactured or compounded by unaffiliated third parties. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of these third parties, and we expect to compete with other companies for raw materials, production and import capacity. If we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any manufacturer or compounder would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to engage third parties. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the manufacturing or compounding of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term.
  
  Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the People’s Republic of China government could negatively affect the production and cost of certain of our products and damage our business.
  
 Certain of our products are currently manufactured in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China and relationships with the United States. The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:
  
 
● | the higher level of government involvement and regulation; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the early stage of development of the market-oriented sector of the economy;
● | the rapid growth rate; 
● | the higher rate of inflation; 
● | tariffs and the higher level of control over foreign exchange; and 
● | government control over the allocation of many resources. 


 
 Although the PRC government has in recent years implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the PRC government continues to exercise significant control over economic growth in China through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and imposing policies that impact particular industries or companies in different ways. Any adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China or relationship with the United States could have a material adverse effect on tariffs and the cost or availability of our products and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.

  Like other distributors and manufacturers of beauty products, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products that we sell results in injury.
  
 While we believe we are currently materially compliant with regulations covering our products, we may be subjected to various product liability claims, including claims that the products we sell contain contaminants, are improperly labeled or include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances. In addition, we may be forced to defend lawsuits. While to date we have never been subject to any product liability claim, given our limited operating history we cannot predict whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or predict the effect of any resulting adverse publicity on our business. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. If our insurance protection is inadequate and our third-party vendors do not indemnify us, the successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages. In addition, interactions of our products with other similar products, prescription medicines and over-the-counter drugs have not been fully explored. We may also be exposed to claims relating to product advertising or product quality. People may purchase our products expecting certain physical results, unique to beauty products. If they do not perceive expected results to occur, such individuals may seek monetary retribution.
  
  Our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable publicity within the beauty products market.
  
 We believe that the beauty products market is significantly affected by national media attention. As with any retail provider, future scientific research or publicity may not be favorable to the industry or to any particular product, and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Because of our dependence on consumers’ perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies and future reports of research that are perceived as less favorable or that question earlier research, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are highly dependent upon consumers’ perceptions of the safety and quality of our products as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Thus, the mere publication of reports asserting that beauty products may be harmful or questioning their efficacy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are scientifically supported or whether the claimed harmful effects would be present at the dosages recommended for such products.
  
  Our success is dependent upon the successful introduction of our new products and success in expanding the demand for existing brands.
  
 We believe the growth of our net sales is substantially dependent upon our ability to introduce our products to the public. Our ability to meet future obligations is dependent in large measure on the success of our product sales. Subject to the availability of sufficient capital and the further establishment of effective distribution channels, we expect to introduce additional products. The success of new products is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to formulate products that will appeal to consumers and respond to market trends in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that our efforts to formulate new products will be successful or that consumers will accept our new products. In addition, products experiencing strong popularity and rapid growth may not maintain their sales volumes over time.
  
  RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK
  
  There may never be an active market for our common stock, which is listed on the NYSE American.
  
 Following our initial public offering in November 2017, there currently is a limited market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, trading of our common stock is limited and sporadic and generally at very low volumes. Further, the price at which our common stock has traded has been below its initial public offering price. We expect that the price will continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general, and securities of small-cap companies in our industry in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. Continued market fluctuations could result in further volatility in the price at which our common stock may trade, which could cause its value to decline. A more active market for our common stock may never develop. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time.
  
  We are subject to the continued listing standards of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock.
  
   
22


  
 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders’ equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer (i) if, in its opinion, the issuer’s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; (iii) if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; (iv) if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American’s listing requirements; (v) if an issuer’s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a “low selling price” and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or (vi) if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE America, in its opinion, inadvisable. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.
  
  The issuance of shares upon exercise of our outstanding options, warrants, and restricted stock options may cause immediate and substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.
  
 We presently have options and warrants that if exercised would result in the issuance of an additional 645,476 shares of our common stock. We presently have restricted stock awards that when vested will result in the issuance of an additional 230,000 shares of our common stock. The issuance of shares upon exercise of warrants and options and upon the vesting of the restricted stock awards may result in dilution to the interests of other shareholders.
  
  The price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
  
 Stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its future volatility. Price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions, some of which are beyond our control, and a variety of other factors, including any of the risk factors described in this report. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance, and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:
  
 
● | price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other hair care products companies generally; 
● | sales of shares of our common stock by us or our shareholders; 
● | failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
● | the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections; 
● | rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 
● | actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations; 


 
   
23


  
 
 
● | actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally; 
● | litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;
● | developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights; 
● | announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or brands by us or our competitors; 
● | new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; 
● | changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; 
● | any significant change in our management; and 
● | general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets. 


 
 In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
  
  We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
  
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to:
  
 
● | being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”; 
● | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;
● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and 
● | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 


 
 Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.
 
  Our executive officers, directors and their affiliates may exert control over us and may exercise influence over
    
24


  
 
  matters subject to shareholder approval.
  
 Our executive officers and directors, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 21.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 13, 2017. Accordingly, these shareholders, if they act together, may exercise substantial influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of corporate transactions, such as a merger. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control over us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.
  
  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, our common stock share price and trading volume could decline.
  
 An active trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We may be unable to attract or sustain coverage by well-regarded securities and industry analysts. If either none or only a limited number of securities or industry analysts cover us or our business, or if these securities or industry analysts are not widely respected within the general investment community, the trading price for our common stock would be materially and negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us or our business downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or our business, or fail to publish reports on us or our business regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the price of our common stock and trading volume to decline.
  
  Public company requirements may strain our resources and divert management’s attention, which could adversely impact our ability to execute our strategy and harm operating results.
  
 As a newly public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which we refer to as “Dodd-Frank,” the listing requirements of the NYSE American and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Despite recent reforms made possible by the JOBS Act, compliance with these rules and regulations will nonetheless increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” While the members of our board of directors have substantial experience relevant to our business, they have limited experience with operations as a public company upon which you can base your prediction of our future success or failure in complying with public company requirements. Our management may fail to comply with public company requirements, or may fail to do so effectively and efficiently, each would materially and adversely harm our ability to execute our strategy and, consequently, our operating results.
  
 Furthermore, as a result of disclosure in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If these claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of management and adversely affect our business, brand and reputation and results of operations. Our new public company status and these new rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of the board of directors, particularly to serve on the audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.
  
  Some provisions of our charter documents and North Carolina law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.
  
 Provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of North Carolina law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:
  
 
● | permit our board of directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
   
25


  
 
 
 | preferences and privileges as they may designate; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; and
● | do not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election. 


 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, North Carolina has two primary anti-takeover statutes, the Shareholder Protection Act and the Control Share Acquisition Act, which govern the shareholder approval required for certain business combinations. As permitted by North Carolina law, we have opted out of both these provisions. Accordingly, we are not subject to any anti-takeover effects of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act or Control Share Acquisition Act. Any provision of our articles of incorporation, bylaws or North Carolina law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our shares of common stock.
