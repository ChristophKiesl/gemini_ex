Merger
 
On December 21, 2020, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with the sole shareholder and owner of Westech Security and Investigations, Inc. (“Westech”). Pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, the sole shareholder of Westech will sell all her shares to the Company in exchange for approximately 66% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Sale”), to become effective at such time as the articles of merger have been filed. The remaining 34% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common Stock shall consist of presently issued and outstanding shares of common Stock of the Company and the following to be issued in the form of Company’s Series E Preferred Stock, convertible into one share of Company’s common Stock, and shall consist of: (i) an exchange of all outstanding preferred stock of the Company, (ii) an exchange of all outstanding loans to the Company which shall either be satisfied or shall convert to Series E Preferred Stock immediately following the closing of the sale so that there are no outstanding loans to the Company at closing of the sale, (iii) a bridge loan of $500,000 previously made to Westech, which shall convert to Series E Preferred Stock immediately following the closing of the sale and (iv) an investment of $750,000 into the Company at closing of the sale. In connection with the additional $1,250,000, the Company shall issue 1,250,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock. Furthermore, subject to the approval of Company’s shareholder and subject to discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will change its name to “Westech Security and Investigation, Inc”, increase the number of shares of authorized preferred stock so it has sufficient amount of preferred stock to undertake the transactions contemplated by the sale; and undertake a 1-for-187 reverse stock split of its shares of common stock. This transaction is expected to close in the 2nd quarter of 2021. 
 
On August 9, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary NuLife Acquisition Corp. (“NuLife Sub”) approved and executed an agreement of merger and plan of reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), to become effective at such time as the articles of merger have been filed with the Secretary of State of Louisiana (the “Effective Time”), and after the satisfaction or waiver by the parties thereto of the conditions set forth in Article VI of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and in exchange for all one hundred (100) issued and outstanding shares of LJR, LJR received one thousand (1,000) shares of series D senior convertible preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Series D Preferred Stock”) of the Company, convertible into fifty million two hundred thirty-nine thousand five hundred forty-one (50,239,541) shares of common stock of the Company.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined.
