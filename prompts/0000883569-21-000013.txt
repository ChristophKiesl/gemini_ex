Item 1.    Business
General
We are a design, innovation and distribution company specializing in consumer fashion accessories. We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1991 and are the successor to a Texas corporation formed in 1984. Our principal executive offices are located at 901 S. Central Expressway, Richardson, Texas 75080, and our telephone number at that address is (972) 234-2525. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol FOSL. Our products include traditional watches, smartwatches, jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts and sunglasses. We design, develop, market and distribute products under our owned brands FOSSIL®, SKAGEN®, MICHELE®, RELIC® and ZODIAC® and licensed brands ARMANI EXCHANGE®, DIESEL®, DKNY®, EMPORIO ARMANI®, KATE SPADE NEW YORK®, MICHAEL KORS®, PUMA®, and TORY BURCH®. Based on our range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.
We report segment information based on the “management approach”. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.
We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis. Our reportable operating segments are comprised of (i) Americas, (ii) Europe and (iii) Asia. Each reportable operating segment includes sales to wholesale and distributor customers, and sales through Company-owned retail stores and e-commerce activities based on the location of the selling entity. The Americas segment primarily includes sales to customers based in Canada, Latin America and the United States. The Europe segment primarily includes sales to customers based in European countries, the Middle East and Africa. The Asia segment primarily includes sales to customers based in Australia, China (including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Each reportable operating segment provides similar products and services.
Owned Brands
    Our ability to build and evolve strong lifestyle brands is key to our success. Across our owned brands, we create great products at competitive prices and deliver engaging experiences directly to our consumers—through our owned channels of distribution and via third party distributors.
Our consumer-first mindset drives every decision we make. By capitalizing on fashion trends and leveraging proprietary data and insights, we are able to deliver relevant, high-value products and experiences to consumers across a diverse range of price points, style preferences and geographies.
Licensed Brands
As a result of our vertical integration, we are uniquely positioned to launch an accessory category, such as watches, in partnership with a licensor in a timely and consistent manner. All of our major licensing relationships are exclusive for the brands we license and may include traditional watches, smartwatches and jewelry.
Products
We design, develop, market and distribute accessories across a variety of product categories: traditional watches, smartwatches, jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts and sunglasses. Additionally, we manufacture and/or distribute private label brands, as well as branded products purchased for resale in certain of our non-FOSSIL branded retail stores. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the breakdown of our net sales and percentage change among proprietary, licensed and other brands for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data).

Traditional Watches and Smartwatches
Traditional watches and smartwatches are our core global business. Sales of watches for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 accounted for approximately 80.6%, 81.3% and 80.0%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
Our full display smartwatches use Google’s WEAR OS operating system. We have a license for WEAR OS that expires on April 27, 2022. Certain of our hybrid and other smartwatches use operating systems developed by us or as otherwise licensed to us by Google. 
Owned Brands
Our primary owned watch brands include FOSSIL, MICHELE, RELIC, SKAGEN and ZODIAC.

 (1) Subject to early termination in certain circumstances

We also license certain internationally known brand names, such as Skechers® and BMW®, for limited distribution in select markets.
Fashion Accessories
In addition to our core watch business, we also design and create jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, and belts across our owned brands and jewelry under licensed brands. In the U.S. and certain international markets, we generally market our fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as our watches using similar marketing approaches. Our fashion accessories are typically sold in locations adjacent to watch departments, which may lead to purchases by persons who are familiar with our watch brands. Sales of our accessory lines accounted for 17.1%, 16.3% and 18.4% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The following table sets forth information about our fashion accessories:

Brand | Accessory Category 
DIESEL | Jewelry 
EMPORIO ARMANI | Jewelry 
FOSSIL | Handbags, small leather goods, belts, eyewear, jewelry
MICHAEL KORS | Jewelry 
SKAGEN | Jewelry 

Licensed Eyewear
We have a license agreement with the Safilo Group for both FOSSIL branded sunglasses and optical frames worldwide. The license agreement provides for royalties to be paid to us based on a percentage of net sales and includes certain guaranteed minimum royalties. Sales of licensed eyewear accounted for approximately 0.4%, 0.5% and 0.4% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Private Label
We design, market and source manufacturing of certain retailers' private label and owned brand watches as well as other company brands to be used as premium and incentive items in various corporate events. Under these arrangements, we perform design and product development functions, as well as act as a sourcing agent for our customers by contracting for and managing the manufacturing process, purchasing and inspecting of the finished product and arranging for shipment. Participation in the private label and premium businesses provides us with certain advantages, including increased assembly volume, which may reduce the costs of assembling our other products, and strengthen business relationships with our manufacturing sources.
Building Strong Brands
Brand building is critical to the success of our Company. We take a consumer-first approach to creating product and brand experiences, with the goal of building meaningful, long-term relationships with our consumers.
Product Design and Development
Our product designs are fueled by a combination of creativity, fashion trends and consumer insights. We have built an in-house design team that works in partnership with our consumer insights and trend teams to ideate, design, test and deliver new product concepts to market. We also employ research and development ("R&D") team members who focus on innovation and product development across our watch and smartwatch categories.
In order to respond to and capitalize on fast-paced changes in the global marketplace, we have created a process that allows us to quickly design and develop consumer insight driven product. We have found speed coupled with insight-driven product to be a true differentiator and key revenue driver across our business.
Marketing and Promotion
We are embracing the changing retail environment and meeting consumers where they are, both on and offline. Our focus on creating the best possible brand experiences requires a blend of art and science—which means prioritizing both creativity and data in everything we do. We have created an in-house digital marketing center of excellence serving both our owned and licensed brands to connect with consumers and to serve up personalized, engaging content. This allows us to learn about their behavior across all channels including digital marketing, social media, Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") and digital media. We use tools provided by salesforce.com, inc. in our CRM initiatives. We drive innovation using a rapid test-and-learn approach with continuous optimization. We are also able to deliver a high level of personalization through the consumer insight and predictive analytics capabilities we have built over the past few years and through our partnerships with leading online third-party retailers.
Operating Strategy
Our goal is to drive shareholder value by increasing earnings and making a positive impact on our people, planet and communities. We operate in a challenging business environment, particularly given the global pandemic. However, we see opportunities for sustainable growth and value creation by focusing on the following strategic priorities:
Increase Brand Excitement
Over the coming year we will intensify our efforts on innovation and brand-building. As the consumer moves toward more normal and stronger purchasing patterns, they will be looking for differentiated and exciting merchandise online and in store. We have a significant opportunity to create more demand among consumers by showcasing great products, telling dynamic stories, and creating customized communications that will enable us to build engaged communities of passionate consumers. We will continue improving our product development process by introducing more consumer-based feedback from key markets. The smartwatch category will receive a boost from upcoming next generation rollouts. Storytelling will improve as we continue to orient strongly to e-commerce and social media channels with the right localized content.
Increase Digital Capabilities 
Our vision is to build on 2020 momentum and become a digital-first organization. To accomplish this, we must continue to unlock the potential of direct-to-consumer online selling, and build digital capabilities and skills throughout our company, all while accelerating our growth through new-world marketing and through the communities we are building. We plan to improve our analytics and marketing capabilities in order to improve returns on our marketing investments. Mainland China and India will continue to be a focus with an extra emphasis on digital as we see strong positive trends in both markets.
Optimize Operations
Over the past year, and partly in response to the pandemic, we have made significant changes in our infrastructure, our commercial activities and in how we manage our end-to-end supply chain. Looking ahead, we will continue to rationalize our retail store base, closely monitor our capital investments, and further optimize our tactics and strategies in inventory management and our end-to-end supply chain. 
Make Time for Good
While commercial success is essential for our future, it is critical that we continue to do the right thing for our planet, communities, and people. We call our platform for Sustainability or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) "Make Time for Good". We believe a sense of purpose is also critically important to our employees, shareholders, and customers and will continue to be so. Our environmental goals include significantly reducing our carbon footprint, eliminating the use of virgin plastics in our supply chain, and increasing the use of recyclable materials such as stainless steel. Our main community goal is to continue to increase our impact on underserved young lives. We will also plan to advance our diversity and inclusion agenda in a number of ways.
Distribution
We have an extensive distribution network that allows us to reach a diverse global customer base. We sell our products through a range of channels including e-commerce, Company-owned retail stores, department and specialty retail stores, airlines, mass markets and concessions.
Stores
Internationally, our products are sold across approximately 140 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 75 independent distributors. Our products are offered on airlines and cruise ships and in international Company-owned retail stores. Our international network of Company-owned stores included 152 retail stores and 121 outlet stores as of January 2, 2021. In certain international markets, our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks, as well as through owned and third-party websites. 
E-commerce
Our holistic e-commerce, or digital efforts, include several channels. First our owned global e-commerce websites deliver engaging brand content, mobile-friendly experiences, and seamless integration with retail stores, including the ability to buy certain products online and pick them up in one of our retail stores, curbside pickup and shipping consumer orders from our stores. Second, we also distribute our products through leading third-party e-commerce retailers. Third, we also distribute through some of our wholesalers’ e-commerce websites and a wide network of additional online retailers. In fiscal year 2020, our digital sales comprised of 38.8% of consolidated net sales compared to 20.1% in fiscal year 2019. 
Sourcing
The vast majority of our products are sourced internationally. Most watch product sourcing is coordinated through our Hong Kong subsidiary, Fossil (East) Limited ("Fossil East"). We do have some limited watch assembly operations through owned facilities in India and Switzerland. Although we do not have long-term contracts with our unrelated watch and accessory manufacturers, we maintain long-term relationships with several manufacturers. These relationships developed due to the significant length of time we have conducted business with the same manufacturers. We believe that we are able to exert some operational control with regard to our principal watch assemblers because of our long standing relationships. In addition, we believe that the relative size of our business with watch manufacturers gives us priority within their production schedules. Furthermore, the manufacturers understand our quality standards, which allow us to produce quality products improving overall operating margins. We have also added third-party facilities and relationships for manufacturing our wearable technology products. Increased volume in the watch category would allow us to further reduce costs through improved volume pricing and enable our suppliers to continue to invest in automation.
Trademarks and Patents
We use our FOSSIL, MICHELE, RELIC, SKAGEN and ZODIAC trademarks, as well as other trademarks, on certain watches and smartwatches, our FOSSIL and SKAGEN trademarks on jewelry, and our FOSSIL trademark on leather goods and other fashion accessories in the U.S. and in a significant number of foreign countries. We also use FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL®, and WSI® as trademarks on retail stores and FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL, WSI, MISFIT, ZODIAC and MICHELE as trademarks on online e-commerce sites. We have taken steps to establish or provide additional protection for our trademarks by registering or applying to register our trademarks for relevant classes of products in each country where our products are sold in addition to certain foreign countries where it is our intent to market our products in the future. Each registered trademark may be renewable indefinitely, so long as we continue to use the mark in the applicable jurisdiction and make the appropriate filings when required. We aggressively protect our trademarks and trade dress and pursue infringement claims both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters both domestically and internationally through third-party online monitoring tools and through leads generated internally, as well as through our business partners worldwide.
Patents
We continue to explore innovations in the design and assembly of our watch, smartwatch, activity tracker and related products. As a result, we have been granted, and have pending, various U.S. and international design and utility patents related to certain product designs, features, and technologies. As of January 2, 2021, none of our patents were material to our business.
Other Intellectual Property
We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, particularly in the wearable technology space. We strive to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with current and prospective product development partners, confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and others that may have access to our proprietary information and through the use of other security measures.
Seasonality 
Our business has a seasonal pattern, with a significant portion of our sales occurring during the end-of-year holiday period.
Inventory Control
We maintain inventory control systems at our facilities that enable us to track each product from the time it is shipped from our factory through shipment to our customers, the end consumer, concessions locations and websites. To facilitate this tracking, a significant number of products sold by us are pre-ticketed and bar coded. Our inventory control systems report shipping, sales and individual stock keeping unit level inventory information. We manage the retail sales process by monitoring customer sales and inventory levels of our products by product category and style, primarily through electronic data interchange. We believe that our distribution capabilities enable us to reduce inventory risk and increase flexibility in responding to the delivery requirements of our customers. We expect that our electronic data interchange efforts will continue to grow in the future as customers focus further on increasing operating efficiencies. In addition, we maintain systems that are designed to track inventory movement through our Company-owned stores. We monitor store inventory movement through review of detailed sales transaction records, which are accumulated on each store’s point-of-sale system.
Upon completion of assembly/manufacturing, the majority of our products are shipped to one of our warehousing and distribution centers in Texas, Germany or Hong Kong, from which they are shipped to subsidiary warehouses or directly to customers in selected markets. Our centralized warehouse and distribution facilities allow us to maximize our inventory management and distribution capabilities and more readily meet the varying distribution requirements placed on us by our customers at a lower cost. Our facilities in Texas and Germany are equipped with automated material handling equipment. The automated equipment and operating systems, in conjunction with the continual sampling of our outgoing orders prior to shipment, are important in maintaining the quality, accuracy, speed and reputation of our products and distribution service.
Significant Customer
No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2020, 2019 or 2018.
Backlog
It is the practice of a substantial number of our customers not to confirm orders by delivering a formal purchase order until a relatively short time prior to the shipment of goods. As a result, the amount of unfilled customer orders includes confirmed orders and orders that we believe will be confirmed by delivery of a formal purchase order. A majority of such amounts represent orders that have been confirmed. The remainder of such amounts represents orders that we believe, based on industry practice and prior experience, will be confirmed in the ordinary course of business. Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality and the scheduling of the manufacture and shipment of our products. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments. At the end of fiscal year 2020, we had unfilled customer orders of approximately $20.3 million compared to $87.6 million and $96.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Competition
The businesses in which we compete are highly competitive and fragmented. The current market for traditional watches can be divided into tiers ranging from lower price point watches that are typically distributed through mass market channels to luxury watches at higher price points that are typically distributed through fine watch departments of upscale department stores or upscale specialty watch and fine jewelry stores. Our watch business generally competes in these tiers with a number of established manufacturers, importers and distributors, including Armitron, Citizen, Gucci, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, LVMH Group, Movado, Raymond Weil, Seiko, Swatch, Swiss Army, TAG Heuer and Timex. In addition, our leather goods, sunglasses, and jewelry businesses compete with a large number of established companies that have significant experience developing, marketing and distributing such products. Our competitors include distributors that import watches and accessories from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories domestically.
We believe the risk of significant new competitors for traditional watches is mitigated to some extent by barriers to entry such as high startup costs and the development of long-term relationships with customers and manufacturing sources. However, in the expanding wearable technology industry, we face competition from technology brands such as Apple and Samsung, from fitness brands such as Fitbit, as well as from many established traditional watch manufacturers that have launched wearable technology products. As this industry evolves and grows, there will likely be increased competition as well. However, we believe our design, branding and distribution are strong competitive advantages.
Although the level and nature of competition varies among our product categories and geographic regions, we compete on the basis of style and technical features, price, value, quality, brand name, advertising, marketing, distribution and customer service. Our ability to identify and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences (including wearable technology), to maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with manufacturing sources, to deliver quality merchandise in a timely manner, to manage the retail sales process, and to continue to integrate technology into our business model are important factors in our ability to compete. Our distinctive business model of owning the distribution in many key markets and offering a globally recognized portfolio of proprietary and licensed products allows for many competitive advantages over smaller, regional or local competitors. This allows us to bypass a local distributor's cost structure in certain countries, resulting in more competitively priced products, while also generating higher product and operating margins.
Governmental Regulation
Imports and Import Restrictions
Most of our products are assembled or manufactured overseas. As a result, the U.S. and countries in which our products are sourced or sold may from time to time modify existing or impose new quotas, duties (including anti-dumping or countervailing duties), tariffs or other restrictions in a manner that adversely affects us. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of "most favored nation" status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. We cannot predict the effect these events would have on our operations, if any, especially in light of the concentration of our assembly and manufacturing operations in Hong Kong, China and mainland China.
General
We are subject to laws regarding customs, tax, employment, privacy, truth-in-advertising, consumer product safety, zoning and occupancy and other laws and regulations that regulate and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of consumer products and our corporate, retail and distribution operations.
Compliance and Trade
Code of Conduct for Manufacturers ("Manufacturer Code")
We are committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations and respect for the rights of all individuals. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. In addition, we are committed to compliance with applicable environmental requirements and are committed to seeing that all of our products are manufactured and distributed in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that our business partners will share these commitments, which we enforce through our Manufacturer Code.
Our Manufacturer Code specifically requires our manufacturers to not use child, forced or involuntary labor and to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We provide training to our factories related to our Manufacturer Code and the applicable laws in the country in which the factory is located. The training provides the factories with a more in-depth explanation of our Manufacturer Code.
In addition to the contractual obligation, we evaluate our suppliers' compliance with our Manufacturer Code through audits conducted both by our employees and third-party compliance auditing firms. In most cases, the audits are announced. If we believe that a supplier is failing to live up to the standards of our Manufacturer Code, we may terminate the supplier or provide the supplier with an opportunity to remedy the non-compliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan. For those suppliers on a corrective action plan, we will work with the supplier as necessary to help them understand the non-compliance and provide advice on how to remedy the non-compliance. We conduct a follow-up audit to confirm compliance after the implementation of the corrective action plan. Should the supplier continue to fail to meet our standards, we may seek to eliminate such supplier from our supply chain.
Quality Control
Our quality control program attempts to ensure that our products meet the standards established by our product development staff. Samples of products are inspected by us prior to placing orders with factories to ensure compliance with our technical design specifications. We also typically inspect "top of production" prototypes of each product before commencing production. The operations of the Hong Kong and Chinese factories that produce our products are monitored on a periodic basis by Fossil East, and the operations of our Swiss factories are monitored on a periodic basis by Montres Antima SA, one of our foreign operating subsidiaries. Substantially all of our watches, jewelry and certain of our other accessories are inspected by personnel of Fossil East or by the assembly/manufacturing facility prior to shipment to our distribution centers. Final inspections, on a sampling basis, occur when the products are received in our distribution centers. We believe that our policy of inspecting our products at the assembly/manufacturing facility, upon receipt at our distribution facilities and prior to shipment to our customers is important to maintain the quality, consistency and reputation of our products.
Trade
Our warehouse and distribution facilities in Texas operate in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. This sub-zone provides the following economic and operational advantages to us: (i) we do not have to pay duty on imported merchandise until it leaves the sub-zone and enters the U.S. market; (ii) we do not have to pay any U.S. duty on merchandise if the imported merchandise is subsequently shipped to locations outside the U.S.; and (iii) we do not have to pay local property tax on inventory located within the sub-zone.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 2, 2021, we employed approximately 7,500 persons, including approximately 5,300 persons employed by our foreign operating subsidiaries.
None of our domestic or foreign-based employees are represented by a trade union. However, certain European-based employees are represented by work councils, which include certain of our current employees who negotiate with management on behalf of all the employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our working relationship with our employees and work councils to be good.
As a purpose driven consumer-centric organization that understands the value of a having a high performing, actively engaged workforce, we believe that our employees fuel our success and are the driving force in delivering our business objectives and creating value for our key stakeholders, including customers, investors, and partners. We consistently strive to be a responsible employer in everything we do, including attracting and employing the most talented people while successfully retaining them over the long-term through employment opportunities, compensation and benefits, personal development, and the purpose-driven environment that we create together. 
Our Organization
Who we are influences our ability to be an employer of choice and elevates the collective strength of our workforce, which we believe provides a competitive advantage through successful human capital management. Fossil Group’s values, which include authenticity, grit, curiosity, sense of humor and making an impact, are the foundation for our workplace policies and practices. 
By the numbers, our workforce is increasingly diverse. Globally, 38% of our employees are in the Americas; 31% are EMEA based; and 31% are in the Asia-Pacific region. Women represent 65% of the company’s employees and men 35%. In the U.S., including corporate, retail and distribution employees, 60% of employees are BIPOC, 38% white and 2% unknown. 
We are committed to be a company that reflects our diverse world and to elevating diversity and inclusion to drive employee and company success. We welcome fresh perspectives and believe that a diverse and inclusive workplace leads to greater innovation, collaboration, creativity and personal and commercial growth. Our journey to a more diverse workforce around the world will be advanced by four primary goals:
1.Be a company that reflects our diverse world and is transparent about our ongoing journey. We establish and share our annual diversity and inclusion goals, and we intend to increase the overall number of BIPOC employees we employ.
2.Create an inclusive experience that engages, retains and provides opportunities for all employees. We have been rated as a best place to work for LGBTQ employees for 2020 and 2021 by the Human Rights Campaign, and we plan to leverage our survey capabilities to understand employee engagement by gender and race.
3.Increase representation of women, BIPOC and black leadership. We intend to increase executive female, BIPOC and black leadership, provide mentor programs for underrepresented groups and invest in female, BIPOC and black leadership.
4.Drive accountability and results across the organization. We intend to include diversity and inclusion goals in leadership performance reviews and bonus metrics and offer interactive workshops and access to extensive ongoing education.
Engaging the Fossil Group Workforce
At Fossil Group, we work to ensure that people in our workplace are and remain engaged. Our objective is to create a high-performance culture where people have the skills and behaviors to help fuel company results and be at their personal best, every day. 
Surveying our employees allows us to understand their perspective, what inspires them and how, as an organization, we can improve. Doing so helps to establish and sustain meaningful engagement. Consistent findings tell us that at the top of the list are: career growth and development, effective communication, recognition, a clear view of the Company’s future, compelling compensation and benefits, and the ability and opportunity to connect to something bigger. With regard to business success, the views of our employees are aligned with business needs to establish a workplace culture including:
•Comprehensive health and leading-edge wellness benefits;
•Innovative two-way communication;
•Value-creating employee development programs;
•Performance management through Company-sponsored time to grow;
•Meaningful recognition; and
•Values-based culture and work environment.
Our employee benefits also include tuition and professional certification and license reimbursement to full and part-time employees. We work to create a workplace where families are a priority as evidenced by a number of programs, including: a parental leave program, a partnership with Milk Stork providing a simple solution to help working mothers to continue to breastfeed and reduce business-travel stress; a Healthy Babies Program that supports parents during their pregnancy; and a return to work policy that allows new parents to phase back into work. Additionally, our WeCare Employee Emergency Assistance Fund is also in place to provide charitable assistance to employees facing financial hardship immediately after a qualifying disaster or unforeseen hardship.
By offering extensive retail and corporate career development programs employees have the opportunity to be positioned for continued success, which is further supported through our performance process that effectively cascades goals throughout the organization to ensure our employees’ efforts are aligned with our strategic priorities. 
At Fossil Group, we prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex (including breast feeding and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, gender dysphoria, race, ethnicity, age, disability, religion, national origin, genetic information, pregnancy, childbirth and related medical condition, veteran’s status and any other status protected by applicable laws. 
Oversight
Our Board of Directors and related committees are actively involved in areas associated with excellence in human capital management and related oversight of certain policies, practices and outcomes – including compensation, diversity and inclusion, employee development, engagement and succession planning. We share our employee survey results with our Board of Directors to keep them apprised of related sentiment, interests and concerns. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee helps to oversee ESG matters. The Audit Committee regularly participates in discussions with our leadership team to ensure oversight of enterprise-level risks and mitigation plans on various topics including those associated with human capital risk. The Audit Committee also engages in regular review of the Company’s monitoring and enforcement of the employee code of conduct and ethics and compliance. The Compensation Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding issues with compensation, benefits and related equity awards for qualifying employees. This work includes proper oversight of executive compensation and Company goals that are part of executives’ performance review. These same goals serve as the foundation for the Company’s employee annual cash bonus plan. 
The Global Pandemic and Our Employee-Friendly Response
The human tragedy created by the COVID-19 pandemic led us to do everything possible to slow the spread of the virus and protect our employees, customers and suppliers, as we closely adhered to health and safety guidelines established by the Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and state, county and community governments. 
In the midst of the pandemic, we have and will continue to enable our employees to work remotely, where possible. We will continue to provide related health and safety training and resources for our employees.
In situations where working remotely was not an option, we implemented extensive health and safety guidelines that included daily wellness checks, temperature checks, the required use of masks for employees and customers, social distancing and a limit to the number of employees gathered in a working location – while also providing and amplifying cleaning and sanitization practices.
We are proud of the progress we have made to provide an inspiring, engaging and rewarding work environment for our employees. We will never stop nurturing our culture in this quickly changing world. To exceed expectations and achieve our aspirations, we will listen, learn, collaborate, set meaningful goals, innovate, and be transparent in our progress, challenges and opportunities that make Fossil Group a destination for high performing, highly engaged talent.
