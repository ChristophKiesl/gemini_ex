Overview
 
Company History
 
iCoreConnect Inc., (the “Company”), a Nevada Corporation, develops and markets secure cloud-based HIPAA compliant software services focused on compliance, workflow/productivity, and electronic health records systems. Our core services technology can be adopted to other vertical markets that require a high degree of secure data communication, such as the legal, financial and education fields.
 
Software as a Service (SaaS) Offerings
 
The Company currently markets secure HIPAA compliant cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) offering under the names of iCoreExchange, iCoreCodeGenius, iCoreSecure, iCoreMD, iCoreDental, iCoreMobile, iCoreHuddle, iCoreRx, iCorePDMP, iCoreEPCS, and iCorePay. The Company’s software is sold under annual recurring revenue subscriptions.
 
iCoreExchange – iCoreExchange offers hospitals, physician practices, dental practices, and other healthcare professionals the extensive functionality needed to securely transfer patient health information to anyone, anywhere and at any time. 
 
iCoreExchange provides a secure, HIPAA compliant email solution using the Direct Protocol that allows doctors to send and receive secure email with attachments to and from other healthcare professionals in the network. iCoreExchange also provides a secure email mechanism to communicate with users outside the exchange e.g., patients and referrals. Users have the ability to build a community, access other communities and increase referrals and collaboration. Users can email standard office documents, JPEG, PDF as well as files with discrete data, Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (“CCDA”), which can then be imported and accessed on most Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Practice Management systems in a HIPAA compliant manner.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires providers and healthcare professionals to transmit encrypted personal health information via electronic means. 
 
iCoreCodeGenius – is Coding Software that provides the coding standards for the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list published by the World Health Organization (WHO).

iCoreSecure – Recent newscasts have been replete with reporting regarding many breaches of consumer personal information. We used our expertise and development capabilities from our HIPAA compliant iCoreExchange and developed iCoreSecure, an encrypted email solution for anyone that needs encrypted email to protect personal and financial data.iCoreSecure solves privacy concerns in the insurance, real estate, financial and many other industry sectors that have a need for secure encrypted email.
 
iCoreMD and iCoreDental – Both are complete EHR/Practice Management software platforms created for the medical and dental communities in response to feedback from doctors and dentists telling us they wanted a cloud-based software that was more flexible than the current medical and dental platforms in the marketplace. The software includes patient demographics, scheduling, billing, electronic medical records, electronic claims, e-prescriptions, labs, merchant services, and patient reminders along with a complete suite of standard reporting capabilities and data analytics to help run a medical or dental practice.
 
Our cloud-based software was certified in November 2015 by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), certificate number 150120r0.
 
iCoreMobile -- iCoreMobile is our third complete EHR software platform, was designed and built specifically for mobile medical and dental care centers. In addition to the features included in iCoreMD and iCoreDental, iCoreMobile also includes workflow optimizations and process enhancements to cater to providers in mobile settings.The software utilizes fully customizable patient intake forms to improve workflow.The always connected software ensures that once a patient’s C-CDA import has been accepted, it is immediately available on all mobile workstations.The enhanced reporting system and metrics provides the main office with extensive data analytics of the mobile unit.The customizable nature of the reporting system allows mobile operators to compare the efficiency of their units.
 
iCoreHuddle – iCoreHuddle is a powerful tool to instantly reveal the revenue potential of each patient. The service connects to most popular practice management and EHR systems to optimize revenue realization. It provides the practice with a dashboard containing various metrics, analytics, and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).iCoreHuddle provides a daily view of patient schedules, including their outstanding balances, uncompleted treatment plans, recall information, procedure information and the amount of remaining insurance benefits.The software also provides one-click access to each patient’s insurance eligibility, including a detailed benefits and deductibles report.This tool aims to increase the workflow efficiency of the dentist’s practice by reducing the number of required lookups and clicks for each patient. 
 
iCoreRx -A fully HIPAA compliant electronic ePrescription software that integrates with popular practice management and EHR systems. It saves time by selecting exact medications at available doses with built-in support from a drug directory and provides full support for EPCS (controlled substances).It protects both the patient and provider by viewing the patient’s complete medication history.It also speeds up the process by allowing the doctor to create a “favorites” list for commonly used medication sets.iCorePDMP is an add-on for iCoreRx that seamlessly integrates with state databases to automate prescription drug monitoring.Providers in many states are required to check the patient’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP / PMP) history before prescribing controlled substances.This service provides a one-click real-time access to the state databases without the need to manually enter data and provides access to PDMP data, including a patient’s health history.This tool also generates patient risk scores and an interactive visualization of usage patterns to help the prescriber identify potential risk factors.The prescriber can then use this report to make decisions on objective insight into potential drug misuse or abuse which will ultimately lead to improved patient safety and better patient outcomes.
 
IT Managed Services - The trend in IT Services companies for over a decade has been to move away from a “Break/Fix '' model to a “Managed Service Provider (MSP)” model with recurring revenue. 
 
The MSP approach, by using preventative measures, keeps computers and networks up and running while data is accessible and safeguarded. Installation of critical patches and updates to virus protection are automated. Systems are monitored and backed up in real-time. They are fixed or upgraded before they cause a service disruption. A Unified Threat Management solution is deployed to protect against virus, malware, SPAM, phishing and ransomware attacks. Remote technical support is a click away. All support is delivered at a predictable monthly cost.
 
Going forward, by leveraging managed services with our expertise in cloud computing, our customers can easily scale their business without extensive capital investment or disruption in services.

Competition - The Company experiences competition from a variety of sources with respect to virtually all of its products and services. The Company knows of no single entity that competes with it across the full range of its products and services; however, each of the lines of business in which the Company is engaged is highly competitive. Competition in the markets served is based on several considerations, which may include price, technology, applications, experience, know-how, reputation, service and distribution. While we believe we offer a unique combination of products and services, a few competitors offer one or more similar products and services in one or more of our niche markets.
Competitive Strengths

We have built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost effectively. Our multi-tenant application architecture maintains the integrity and separation of customer data while still permitting all customers to use the same application functionality simultaneously.
 
2. Rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership.
 
Our services can be deployed rapidly since our customers do not have to spend time procuring, installing or maintaining the servers, storage, networking equipment, security products or other hardware and software. We enable customers to achieve up-front savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Customers benefit from the predictability of their future costs since they generally pay for the service on a per subscriber basis for the term of the subscription contract.
 
3. High levels of user adoption.
 
We have designed our products and services to be intuitive and easy to use. Our products and services contain many tools and features recognizable to users of popular consumer web services, so users have a more familiar user experience than typical EHR applications. As a result, our users can often use and gain benefit from our solutions with minimal training. We have also designed our products and services to be used on popular mobile devices, making it possible for people to conduct business from their smartphones or tablets.
