Mission and Strategies
The Company's mission is to be America's leading independent energy company, focused on value, safety, the environment, technology and our greatest asset, our people. The Company's long-term growth strategy is centered around the following strategic objectives:
•maintaining a strong balance sheet to ensure financial flexibility; 
•delivering economic production and reserve growth through drilling, completion and production improvement activities;
•utilizing the Company's scale and technology advancements to reduce costs and improve efficiency;
•returning free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases; 
•developing and training employees and contractors to perform their jobs in a safe manner; and
•stewarding the environment through industry leading sustainable development efforts.
The Company's long-term strategy is anchored by the Company's interests in the long-lived Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, which has an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 50 years. 
Business Activities
Pioneer's purpose is to competitively and profitably explore for, develop and produce oil and gas reserves. In so doing, the Company sells homogeneous oil, NGL and gas units that, except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences, cannot be significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by the Company's competitors. The Company's portfolio of resources and opportunities are located in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field, and provide long-lived, dependable production and lower-risk exploration and development opportunities. 
Petroleum industry. Over the past several years, the oil price environment has been characterized by high volatility. During 2019, Brent oil prices rose to a high of $74.57 per barrel in April 2019, up from a low of $54.91 per barrel in early January 2019. During 2020 to date, Brent oil prices declined to a low of $49.45 in February 2020. Significant factors that are likely to affect 2020 commodity prices include: the effect of U.S. energy, monetary, environmental and trade policies, including 
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

policies related to U.S. and China trade negotiations and Iranian oil sanctions; fiscal challenges facing the United States federal government; the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and throughout the world; geopolitical issues globally, especially in the Middle East; the extent to which Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") members and some nonmembers, including Russia, adhere to and agree to extend their oil production quota's; uncertain demand fundamentals in 2020 and beyond, led by rising oil consumption in China and India offset by European Union members reshaping their fossil fuel consumption towards lower carbon energy; overall North American and worldwide gas supply and demand fundamentals, including the timing of incremental LNG export capacity additions; and global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the recent coronavirus, which may reduce demand for oil, NGL and gas because of reduced global or national economic activity. Because the global economic and political outlook and commodity price environment are uncertain, the Company endeavors to maintain a strong financial liquidity position to provide financial flexibility should commodity prices decline and remain low for an extended period of time.
While the industry has invested in initiatives designed to increase oil, NGL and gas takeaway capacity associated with growing U.S. shale production, such as the construction of additional oil and NGL export facilities and new liquefied natural gas ("LNG") facilities, the supply of these products has increased at a faster pace than the overall U.S. and international demand for these commodities. Oil, NGL products and gas supplies are expected to continue to increase during 2020 and prices are expected to remain volatile. To mitigate this risk, Pioneer enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company's area of production with the objective of transporting a significant portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to higher priced markets. Specifically, the Company has entered into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to Gulf Coast refineries and LNG facilities, international export markets and to satisfy unused gas pipeline capacity commitments. These marketing activities provided incremental cash flow of $283 million in 2019 and $458 million in 2018, compared to cash outlays of $31 million in 2017. 
The Company also uses commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility on the Company's net cash provided by operating activities and its net asset value. The Company has entered into derivative contracts for a portion of its forecasted 2020 production; consequently, if commodity prices decline, the Company could realize lower prices for volumes not protected by the Company's derivative activities and could see a reduction in derivative contract prices available on additional volumes in the future. As a result, the Company's internal cash flows will be negatively impacted by a reduction in commodity prices or to the extent that sales prices do not cover the third-party purchase price and cost of transportation for that portion of volumes transported to other markets. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Liquidity. The Company's primary needs for cash are for (i) capital expenditures, (ii) acquisitions of oil and gas properties, (iii) payments of contractual obligations, including debt maturities, (iv) dividends and share repurchases and (v) working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of the Company's primary sources of liquidity including: (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) net cash provided by operating activities, (iii) sales of investments, (iv) unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility, (v) issuances of debt or equity securities and (vi) other sources, such as sales of nonstrategic assets. Although the Company expects that these sources of funding will be adequate to fund its 2020 capital expenditures, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, including stock repurchases, no assurance can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs. 
Production. The Company focuses its efforts towards maximizing its average daily production of oil, NGLs and gas through development drilling, production enhancement activities and acquisitions of producing properties, while minimizing controllable costs associated with production activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company's production of 126 MMBOE, excluding field fuel usage, represented an eight percent increase compared to production during 2018. See "Item 2. Properties — Selected Oil and Gas Information — Production, price and cost data" for additional information.
Drilling activities. The Company believes that its current property base provides a substantial inventory of prospects for future reserve, production and cash flow growth. 
Development activities. The Company seeks to increase its proved oil and gas reserves, production and cash flow through development drilling and by conducting other production enhancement activities, such as well recompletions. The Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 include proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non-producing reserves of 39 MMBbls of oil, 16 MMBbls of NGL and 83 Bcf of gas. The timing of the development of these proved reserves will be dependent upon commodity prices, drilling and operating costs and the Company's expected operating cash flows and financial condition. During the three years ended December 31, 2019, the Company drilled 854 gross (745 net) exploration and development wells, with 98 percent of the gross wells (99 percent of net wells) being successfully completed as productive wells, at a total drilling cost (net to the Company's interest) of $9.2 billion, including infrastructure capital.

Exploratory activities. The Company has a significant portfolio of lower-risk exploration opportunities that are expected to be evaluated and tested in the future. Exploratory and extension drilling involve greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons than development drilling or enhanced recovery activities.
Acquisition activities. The Company regularly seeks to acquire or trade for acreage that complements its operations, provides exploration and development opportunities, increases the lateral length of future horizontal wells and potentially provides superior returns on investment. The Company periodically evaluates and pursues acquisition and acreage trade opportunities (including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas assets or entities owning oil and gas assets and opportunities to engage in mergers, consolidations or other business combinations with such entities) and at any given time may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of internal financial analyses, oil and gas reserve analyses, due diligence, the submission of indications of interest, preliminary negotiations, negotiations of letters of intent or negotiations of definitive agreements. The success of any acquisition or acreage trade is uncertain and depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company's control.
During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company spent $28 million, $65 million and $136 million, respectively, primarily to purchase undeveloped acreage for future exploitation and exploration activities in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field of the Permian Basin. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information. 
Integrated Services. The Company continues to utilize its integrated services to control well costs and operating costs in addition to supporting the execution of its drilling and production activities. The Company owns field service equipment that supports its drilling and production operations, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools. 
The Company continues to construct a field-wide water distribution system to reduce the cost of water for drilling and completion activities and to secure adequate supplies of water to support the Company's long-term growth plan for the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field. During 2019, the Company expanded its mainline system, subsystems and frac ponds to efficiently deliver water to Pioneer's drilling locations. The Company is purchasing approximately 120 thousand barrels per day of effluent water from the City of Odessa and is partnering with the City of Midland to upgrade the city's wastewater treatment plant in return for approximately two billion barrels of low-cost, non-potable water over a 28-year contract period (up to 240 thousand barrels per day) to support its drilling and completion activities. The Midland wastewater treatment plant is scheduled for completion in early 2021.
Asset divestitures. The Company regularly reviews its asset base to identify nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities, create organizational and operational efficiencies and further the Company's objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet to ensure financial flexibility. 
See Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information. 
Marketing of Production
General. Production from the Company's properties is marketed using methods that are consistent with industry practices. Sales prices for oil, NGL and gas production are negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as an index or spot price, price regulations, distance from the well to the pipeline, commodity quality and prevailing supply and demand conditions. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information.
Seasonal nature of business. Generally, but not always, the demand for gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers may impact general seasonal changes in demand. 
Significant purchasers. During 2019 the Company's oil, NGL and gas sales to Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., Occidental Energy Marketing Inc. and Plains Marketing L.P. accounted for 33 percent, 20 percent and 13 percent of the Company's oil and gas revenues, respectively. The loss of one of these significant purchasers or an inability to secure adequate pipeline, gas plant and NGL fractionation infrastructure for its Permian Basin production could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to produce and sell its oil, NGL and gas production.
Revenues from sales of purchased oil and gas to Occidental Energy Marketing Inc. accounted for 30 percent of the Company's sales of purchased oil and gas. No other purchaser of oil or gas purchased by the Company from third parties 
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

exceeded ten percent during 2019. The loss of this significant purchaser of purchased oil and gas would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell commodities it purchases from third parties. 
See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Derivative risk management activities. The Company primarily utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts, collar contracts with short puts and basis swap contracts that are intended to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. From time to time, the Company also utilizes interest rate derivative contracts intended to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's indebtedness. 
The Company enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company's areas of production. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to Gulf Coast refineries and LNG facilities, international export markets and to satisfy unused gas pipeline capacity commitments.
