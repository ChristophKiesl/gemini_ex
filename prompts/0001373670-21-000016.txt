ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Green Brick Partners, Inc. (formerly named BioFuel Energy Corp.) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company”, “we”, or “Green Brick”) is a diversified homebuilding and land development company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 11, 2006. 
We acquire and develop land, provide land and construction capital to our wholly owned and controlled builders (together, “builders”) and participate in the profits of our builders. Our core markets are in the high growth U.S. metropolitan areas of Dallas-Forth Worth (“DFW”), Texas and Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the Treasure Coast, Florida area. We also own a noncontrolling interest in a builder in Colorado Springs, Colorado. We are engaged in all aspects of the homebuilding process, including land acquisition and development, entitlements, design, construction, title and mortgage services, marketing and sales and the creation of brand images at our residential neighborhoods and master planned communities. 
We believe we offer higher quality homes with more distinctive designs and floor plans than those built by our competitors at comparable prices. Our communities are located in premium locations and we seek to enhance homebuyer satisfaction by utilizing high-quality materials, offering a broad range of customization options and building well-crafted homes. We seek to maximize value over the long term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and quickly reacting to regional and local market trends.
We are a leading lot developer in our markets and believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. We currently own or control approximately 14,500 home sites in high-growth submarkets throughout the DFW and Atlanta metropolitan areas and the Treasure Coast, Florida market. We are strategically positioned to either build new homes on our lots through our builders or to sell finished lots to third-party homebuilders. We sell finished lots to our builders or option lots from third-party developers for our builders’ homebuilding operations and provide them with construction financing and strategic planning. Our builders provide us with their local knowledge and relationships. 
The following table presents general information about our builders, including the types of homes they build and their price ranges.

Business Strategy
We believe we are well-positioned for growth through the disciplined execution of the following elements of our strategy: 
Combine Land Acquisition and Development Expertise with Homebuilding Operations to Maximize Profitability
Our ability to identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on how we expect such opportunities will contribute to overall profitability and returns, rather than how they might drive volume on a market basis. We identify attractive properties that are typically located in prime neighborhood locations. We consider the existing and future supply of developable land before working to acquire the best-valued properties. Analysis includes consideration of development costs in addition to land costs. We have found that the prime quality infill locations have limited supply competition that may result in smaller value declines in down markets. We manage and oversee all land development with our in-house staff.
We believe our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target homebuyer’s expectations, while selling homes at competitive prices. Our strategy of holding land inventory provides us with a multi-year supply of lots for future homebuilding while limiting any excess supply that would otherwise be subject to market cycle risk. We focus on the development of entitled parcels in communities where we can generally sell all lots and homes within 24 to 60 months from the start of sales. This focus allows us to limit exposure to land development and market cycle risk while pursuing favorable returns on our investments. We seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, the use of land and lot options and other flexible land acquisition arrangements. We are actively involved in every step of the land entitlement, home design and construction processes with our builders. 
Maximize Benefits of Diversified Homebuilding and Land Development Structure
Our diversified homebuilding and land development structure provides the flexibility to monetize the value of our land assets either by building and selling homes through our builders or developing land and selling finished lots to unaffiliated homebuilders. When evaluating our land assets, we consider the potential contribution of each asset to our overall performance, taking into account the timeframe over which we may monetize the asset. While we currently expect the majority of our land to be utilized by our homebuilders, we believe our land development and homebuilding strategy provides us with increased flexibility to seek to maximize risk-adjusted returns as market conditions warrant.
Increase Long-Term Value by Investing in Infrastructure
In our communities, we typically make enhanced investment in infrastructure, including landscaping and amenity centers, and enforce higher construction standards through our builders. We believe this creates greater long-term value for us and for our builders, homebuyers, shareholders and the communities in which we build.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Disciplined Investment Approach
We seek to maximize value over the long-term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and focusing on regional and local market trends. Our management team has gained significant operating expertise through varied economic cycles. The perspective gained from these experiences has helped shape our investment approach. We believe that our management team has learned to effectively evaluate housing trends in our markets, and to react quickly and rationally to market changes. Our cycle-tested management approach balances strategic planning with day-to-day decision-making responsibilities, freeing up our builders to concentrate on growing our homebuilding business rather than focusing on obtaining capital to fund their operations. We believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
Increase Market Positions in Housing Markets with a Favorable Growth Outlook and Strong Demand Fundamentals
We believe that we have strategically well-located land and lot positions within our core markets and that we have acquired our land and lot positions at attractive prices, providing us with significant opportunity for a healthy return on our investment. We believe our core markets exhibit attractive residential real estate investment characteristics, such as growing economies, improving levels of employment and population growth relative to national averages, favorable migration patterns, general housing affordability, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics. We believe that increasing demand and supply constraints in our core markets create favorable conditions for our future growth. 
We believe that there are significant opportunities to profitably expand in our core markets. For example, we currently own or control approximately 14,500 home sites in the DFW, Atlanta and Treasure Coast markets. In Dallas and Atlanta, we seek to acquire land with convenient access to metropolitan areas which have diverse economic and employment bases and demographics that we believe will support long-term growth. We continuously review the allocation of our investments in these markets taking into account demographic trends and the likely impact on our operating results. We use the results of these reviews to reallocate our investments to those areas where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital. We seek to use our local relationships with land sellers, brokers and investors to pursue the purchase of additional land parcels in our core markets. While our primary growth strategy focuses on increasing our market position in our existing markets, we may, on an opportunistic basis, explore expansion into attractive new markets.
Superior Design, Broad Product Range and Enhanced Homebuying Experience
Within each of our markets, we partner our expertise with that of our builders to design attractive neighborhoods and homes to appeal to a wide variety of potential homebuyers. One of our core operating philosophies is to create a culture which provides a positive, memorable experience for our homebuyers through active engagement in the building process. At higher price points, we provide our homebuyers with customization options to suit their specific needs and tastes. In consultation with nationally and locally recognized architecture firms, interior and exterior consultants and homeowner focus groups, we research and design a diversified range of products for various levels and price points. Our homebuilding projects include townhomes, patio homes, single family homes and luxury semi-custom homes. We believe we can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk because of our diversified product strategy. 
Pursue Further Growth Through the Prudent Use of Leverage
As of December 31, 2020, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 25.6%. The debt to total capitalization ratio is calculated as the sum of borrowings on lines of credit, the senior unsecured notes and notes payable, net of debt issuance costs, divided by the total Green Brick Partners, Inc. stockholders’ equity. It is our intent to prudently employ leverage to continue to invest in our land acquisition, development and homebuilding businesses. We target a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 30% to 35%, which we expect will continue to provide us with significant additional growth capital.
Pursue Expansion of Trophy Signature Homes into New Markets
We intend to pursue expansion into new markets with Trophy Signature Homes. We believe Trophy’s more affordable product and quicker inventory turns make its platform uniquely scalable to expand outside of the DFW metroplex. We plan to expand Trophy into markets compatible with our existing markets that demonstrate strong trends in demographics, employment, and in-migration by leveraging existing relationships with land developers and homebuilders.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Pursue Acquisitions of Additional Homebuilders
We intend to pursue the acquisition of additional homebuilders in our core and new markets. Our preference is to continue to acquire controlling interests in homebuilders with existing management continuing to own a significant ownership stake. We will seek to acquire and then retain management teams which have strong local relationships with land owners and have a positive reputation for building well-crafted homes in their markets. We expect that our ability to provide capital discipline and strategic oversight will complement the local skills, relationships and reputations of our future homebuilder partners.
Marketing and Sales Process
We offer a preferred lender referral program through our mortgage subsidiary to provide lending options to homebuyers in need of financing. We offer homeowners a comprehensive warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by a ten-year warranty for structural concerns, one year for defects and products used, two years for electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning parts and labor. 
We sell our homes through our internal sales representatives and also through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes near or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of customization and upgrade options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to appeal to the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. Additionally, we advertise through the use of model homes, social media, newspapers, billboards, real estate market publications, brochures, and newsletters.
Corporate Developments
Effective April 29, 2020, through a series of transactions, the Company acquired the remaining membership and voting interests in our subsidiary, CB JENI Homes DFW LLC (“CB JENI”). As a result, CB JENI became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was no longer considered a VIE and was consolidated based on the majority voting interest pursuant to ASC 810. As both the entity wholly owned by the Company to which CB JENI ownership interests were assigned and CB JENI were controlled by the Company on April 29, 2020, the acquisition of the remaining membership interest was accounted for at the carrying amounts on CB JENI’s books, pursuant to provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805 that govern transactions between entities under common control.
In May 2020, we established a joint venture, BHome Mortgage, LLC (“BHome Mortgage”) with First Continental Mortgage, Ltd., to provide mortgage related services to homebuyers. The Company owns 49.0% in BHome Mortgage. In May 2020, BHome Mortgage received initial capital contributions of approximately $0.5 million from each of its two members in accordance with their membership interest. The investment in BHome Mortgage is treated as an unconsolidated investment under the equity method of accounting and is included in investments in unconsolidated entities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
In August 2020, GBTM Sendera, LLC joint venture (“GBTM Sendera”) was formed by GRBK Edgewood, LLC (“GRBK Edgewood”) and TM Sendera, LLC (“TM Sendera”) with the purpose to acquire and develop a tract of land in Fort Worth,Texas. Each party holds a 50% ownership interest in GBTM Sendera. GBTM Sendera had no activity in the period but it is expected to begin its operations in the first quarter 2021. In August 2020, GBTM Sendera received two $9.0 million initial contributions from each of its two members, GRBK Edgewood and TM Sendera. 
Raw Materials
Typically, all the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started could cause shortages in the availability of such materials or in the price of services, thereby leading to delays in the delivery of homes. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. See “Risk Factors - Labor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.”
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Seasonality
The homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes five to nine months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders are delivered. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the third and fourth quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
Competition
Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our revenues and margins. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including bodily injury, and investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination. Please see “Risk Factors” located in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Human Capital Resources 
We believe the people who work for our Company are our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits, and we offer our employees a compensation package and benefits, including medical, dental, life insurance and other health and welfare plans, that we believe are competitive.
We believe having a diverse and inclusive work environment, where everyone has a sense of belonging, not only drives engagement but fosters innovation, which is critical to driving growth. Our management teams are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior and includes required internal training on preventing, identifying, reporting and stopping any type of discrimination. Furthermore, our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides long-term focus and continuity to our operations while also providing opportunities for the growth and advancement of our employees.
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees, trade partners and homebuyers. During fiscal 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety protocols to protect our employees, trade partners and homebuyers, including protocols regarding social distancing, health checks and working remotely. Our experienced teams adapted quickly to the changes and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time. We are also committed to worker safety and regulatory compliance. 
Although we subcontract certain components of our land development and construction aspects of our homebuilding activities, we are highly dependent on our skilled employees for critical aspects of what we do. That includes senior executives who are responsible for our operational strategies and for approving significant land acquisitions and other major investments we make. It also includes the people who head our homebuilding operations, as well as the many people who are involved in design, construction oversight, marketing and other aspects of our homebuilding business and in carrying out our other activities.
At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 440 individuals of whom approximately 400 were involved in our homebuilding operations, with locations in Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia and the Treasure Coast, Florida, and approximately 40 support our corporate office. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates.
