Overview
Alleghany Corporation owns and supports certain operating subsidiaries and manages investments, anchored by a core position in property and casualty reinsurance and insurance. Alleghany Corporation, incorporated in Delaware in 1984, is the successor company to Alleghany Corporation, a Maryland corporation, which was founded in 1929. Through TransRe, a wholly-owned Alleghany subsidiary since March 2012, we are engaged in the property and casualty reinsurance business. Through AIHL, a wholly-owned intermediate holding company, we are engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. AIHL’s principal insurance company subsidiaries are RSUI and CapSpecialty. RSUI and CapSpecialty have been subsidiaries of AIHL since July 2003 and January 2002, respectively. AIHL Re, a Vermont captive reinsurance company which provides reinsurance to Alleghany’s current and former insurance operating subsidiaries and affiliates, has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alleghany since its formation in May 2006.
Although our primary sources of revenues and earnings are our reinsurance and insurance operations and investments, we also generate revenues and earnings from a diverse portfolio of non-financial businesses that are owned and managed through our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Capital. Alleghany Capital’s businesses include: PCT; Kentucky Trailer; IPS; Jazwares; W&W|AFCO Steel; Concord; Wilbert; and Piedmont.
In addition, we own certain other holding company investments. Our wholly-owned subsidiary Alleghany Properties owns and manages certain properties in the Sacramento, California region. Our public equity investments are managed primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary Roundwood. Prior to its December 31, 2020 sale, SORC was our wholly-owned subsidiary.
As of December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $32.3 billion and total stockholders’ equity attributable to Alleghany stockholders of $9.2 billion.
Our principal executive offices are located in leased office space at 1411 Broadway, 34th Floor, New York, New York, 10018. Our telephone number is (212) 752-1356. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act,” are available, free of charge, on our website at www.alleghany.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file this material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Segment Information
Our segments are reported in a manner consistent with the way management evaluates the businesses. As such, we classify our businesses into three reportable segments – reinsurance, insurance and Alleghany Capital. Reinsurance and insurance underwriting activities are evaluated separately from investment and other activities.
Corporate activities are not classified as a segment. The primary components of corporate activities are Alleghany Properties, activities at the Alleghany parent company and, prior to its December 31, 2020 sale, SORC.

In 2021, our reinsurance and insurance segments constituted the majority of our total consolidated revenues, as follows:

 Reinsurance Segment
General. The reinsurance segment consists of property and casualty reinsurance operations conducted by TransRe’s reinsurance operating subsidiaries. TransRe’s operating subsidiaries also write a modest amount of property and casualty insurance business, which is included in the reinsurance segment.
TransRe, through its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries Transatlantic Reinsurance Company, or “TRC,” TransRe London Ltd., or “TRL,” and TransRe Europe S.A., or “TRESA,” provides property and casualty reinsurance to insurance and other reinsurance companies. These products are distributed both through brokers and on a direct basis in domestic and foreign markets. Domestically, TransRe is headquartered in New York, New York and has nine other office locations in the U.S. TransRe also has operations worldwide, including: Africa, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Asia (where it has five locations), South America (where it has two locations), the U.K. and Europe (where it has five locations). TRC is licensed, accredited or otherwise approved as a reinsurer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico and Guam. TRC is also licensed in Bermuda, Canada, Japan, the U.K., Mexico, several countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Australia and Singapore. In addition, TRL is licensed as a reinsurer in the U.K. and TRESA is licensed as a reinsurer in Luxembourg and the Dubai International Financial Centre, or "DIFC".

The reinsurance segment constitutes the majority of our consolidated net premiums written and is reported through two major product lines, “property” and “casualty & specialty.”
2021 Net Premiums Written
 
•Property. TransRe’s principal lines of business within property include: fire; allied lines; auto physical damage; and homeowners multiple peril (which include property catastrophe risks). 
 •Casualty & specialty. TransRe’s principal lines of business within casualty & specialty include: directors’ and officers’ liability; errors and omissions liability; general liability; auto liability; medical malpractice; ocean marine; aviation; accident & health; mortgage reinsurance; surety; and credit. 
 Reinsurance contracts are generally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. TransRe provides property and casualty reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis. Treaty reinsurance is a contractual arrangement that provides for the automatic reinsuring of all or a portion of a specified class of risk underwritten by the ceding company. Facultative reinsurance is the reinsurance of individual risks. Rather than agreeing to reinsure all or a portion of a class of risk, the reinsurer separately rates and underwrites each risk. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased for risks not covered by treaty reinsurance or for individual risks covered by reinsurance treaties that are in need of capacity beyond that provided by such treaties.
A ceding company’s reinsurance program may involve pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis. TransRe provides pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance for most major lines of business. Under pro rata reinsurance (also referred to as proportional or quota share reinsurance), the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion, and such proportional sharing of losses may be subject to a predetermined limit. As pro rata business is a proportional sharing of premiums and losses between the ceding company and the reinsurer, generally the underwriting results of such business more closely reflect the underwriting results of the business ceded than do the results of excess-of-loss business. In pro rata reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission, which is generally based on the ceding company’s cost of obtaining the business being reinsured, such as brokers’ and agents’ commissions, local taxes and administrative expenses. Under excess-of-loss reinsurance (also referred to as non-proportional reinsurance), the reinsurer indemnifies the ceding company for all or a portion of the losses in excess of a predetermined amount, usually up to a predetermined limit. Premiums paid by the ceding company to the reinsurer for excess-of-loss coverage are generally not proportional to the premiums that the ceding company receives because the reinsurer does not assume a proportionate risk. Often there is no ceding commission on excess-of-loss reinsurance and therefore the pricing mechanism used by reinsurers in those instances is a rate applicable to premiums of the individual policy or policies subject to the reinsurance agreement. Both pro rata and excess-of-loss reinsurance may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.
In July 2016, TransRe entered into a five-year agreement with General Reinsurance Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for TransRe to act as exclusive underwriting manager on behalf of General Reinsurance Corporation for U.S. and Canadian property and casualty treaty reinsurance business produced by brokers and intermediaries. Fees earned under this agreement are recognized as product and service revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the underlying reinsurance contracts. This agreement was not renewed by mutual consent after the five-year term expired in July 2021.

As of December 31, 2021, the statutory surplus of TRC was $5.1 billion, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles, or “SAP,” and the consolidated equity of TransRe was $5.4 billion, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or “GAAP.”
Distribution. TransRe provides property and casualty reinsurance through brokers as well as directly to insurance and reinsurance companies in domestic and foreign markets. In 2021, approximately 84 percent of TransRe’s gross premiums written were written through brokers with the balance written directly with ceding company clients. In the reinsurance brokerage industry, brokers are engaged by the ceding companies to place reinsurance on their behalf. In 2021, companies controlled by Aon plc, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and TigerRisk Partners, LLC were TransRe’s largest brokerage sources of business, accounting for approximately 30 percent, 23 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of gross premiums written. The reinsurance brokerage industry is dominated by certain of these brokers. Due to the substantial percentages of premiums written through these brokers, the loss of business from any one of them could have a material adverse effect on TransRe’s business.
Underwriting. TransRe’s underwriting process emphasizes a team approach among TransRe’s underwriters, actuaries, claims staff and senior management, as appropriate. Treaties are reviewed for compliance with TransRe’s underwriting guidelines and objectives, and most treaties are evaluated in part based upon actuarial analyses conducted by TransRe. TransRe’s actuaries are independent from the underwriting department and are responsible for providing underwriters objective account analyses utilizing available industry and account-specific data along with industry and proprietary actuarial models. TransRe’s actuarial models used in such analyses are tailored in each case to the exposures and experience underlying the specific treaty and the loss experience for the risks covered. Property catastrophe-exposed treaties are generally evaluated using industry standard models, as well as proprietary TransRe models. These models are used as a guide for risk assessment and portfolio optimization and are continually updated. TransRe also frequently conducts underwriting and claims audits at the offices of a ceding company before and after entering into major treaties. This is because reinsurers, including TransRe, do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under such treaties and, consequently, are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by the ceding company. Such dependence subjects TransRe, and reinsurers in general, to the possibility that the ceding companies have not adequately evaluated and priced the risks to be reinsured and, therefore, that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate TransRe for the risk assumed.
TransRe often seeks to lead treaty placements. The lead reinsurer on a treaty generally accepts one of the largest percentage shares of the treaty and therefore has significant influence in negotiating price, terms and conditions. TransRe may decline any treaty business offered to it based upon its assessment of all relevant factors. Such factors include type and level of risk assumed; actuarial and underwriting judgment with respect to rate adequacy; various treaty terms; prior and anticipated loss experience (including exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes) on the treaty; prior business experience with the ceding company; overall financial position; operating results; ratings from credit rating agencies of the ceding company; and social, legal, regulatory, environmental and general economic conditions affecting the risks assumed or the ceding company.
Ratings. TRC, TRL and TRESA are rated A+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, or “S&P,” and A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best Company, Inc., or “A.M. Best,” and TRC is rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service Inc., or “Moody’s.” Additional information regarding ratings and the risks related to ratings from ratings agencies can be found on page 51 of this Form 10-K.
Insurance Segment
The insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance operations conducted in the U.S. by AIHL through RSUI, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, and CapSpecialty, headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut. AIHL Re, our Vermont-domiciled captive reinsurance company, provides reinsurance to our current and former insurance operating subsidiaries and affiliates. Unless we state otherwise, references to AIHL include the operations of RSUI, CapSpecialty and AIHL Re.
The insurance segment constitutes a smaller portion of our consolidated net premiums written and is reported through our RSUI and CapSpecialty subsidiaries.

2021 Net Premiums Written
 

RSUI
General. RSUI conducts its insurance operations through its wholly-owned insurance company subsidiaries RSUI Indemnity Company, or “RIC,” Landmark American Insurance Company, or “Landmark,” and Covington Specialty Insurance Company, or “Covington.” RSUI’s operating subsidiaries write specialty insurance coverages in the property, umbrella/excess liability, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability and professional liability lines of business. RSUI’s operating subsidiaries also write a modest amount of reinsurance business on an assumed basis, which is included in the insurance segment.
The market for specialty insurance coverages differs significantly from the market for standard insurance coverages. The specialty market provides coverage for hard-to-place risks that generally do not fit the underwriting criteria of the standard market, which provides coverage for largely uniform and relatively predictable exposures and is highly regulated with respect to rates and forms.
RSUI’s operating subsidiaries write specialty business on both an admitted and non-admitted basis. Admitted insurers are authorized to market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable from a state’s admitted insurance markets. Non-admitted insurance is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by insureds’ direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to premium rates and forms. RSUI writes admitted specialty business primarily through RIC, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer, licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Specialty business written by RIC is subject to state policy form and premium rate regulations. Most of the risks in the admitted specialty market are unique and hard-to-place in the standard market. However, rather than looking to the non-admitted market, certain policyholders procure such specialty coverage from an admitted insurance company based on regulatory and/or marketing concerns. As an admitted carrier, RIC is subject to more state regulation than a non-admitted carrier, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state associations, such as state guaranty funds and assigned risk plans.
RSUI writes business on a surplus lines eligible, non-admitted basis primarily through Landmark, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer. As a surplus lines eligible, non-admitted insurance company, Landmark is not subject to state policy form and premium rate regulations and thus has more flexibility in setting rates and coverages for specialized or hard-to-place risks. This typically results in policies with higher premiums and more restrictive coverage provisions than coverages written by a standard insurance company. As of December 31, 2021, Landmark was approved to write business on a non-admitted basis in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Covington, a New Hampshire-domiciled insurer, was formed in September 2007 to, among other things, issue surplus lines policies written by RSUI. Through RSUI’s binding authority department, Covington writes small, specialized coverages pursuant to underwriting authority arrangements with managing general agents.
Pursuant to quota share arrangements in place since 2009, Landmark and Covington cede 90 percent of all their respective premiums and losses, gross of third-party reinsurance, to RIC.

As of December 31, 2021, the statutory surplus of RIC was approximately $1.9 billion, the statutory surplus of Landmark was approximately $158 million, the statutory surplus of Covington was approximately $52 million, each as determined in accordance with SAP, and the consolidated equity of RSUI was $1.9 billion, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
Distribution. As of December 31, 2021, RSUI conducted its insurance business through approximately 100 independent wholesale insurance brokers located throughout the U.S. and 20 managing general agents. RSUI’s wholesale brokers are appointed based on management’s appraisal of expertise, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent and the size and experience of the agency. A wholesale broker’s operations are appointed to distribute RSUI’s products on a location by location basis. Producer agreements which stipulate premium collection, payment terms and commission arrangements are in place with each wholesale broker. No wholesale broker holds underwriting, claims or reinsurance authority for RSUI. RSUI’s top five producing wholesale brokers accounted for approximately 84 percent of gross premiums written by RSUI in 2021. RSUI’s top two producing wholesale brokers, Ryan Specialty Group and AmWINS Group, Inc., accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 51 percent of RSUI’s gross premiums written in 2021. RSUI has entered into underwriting authority arrangements with 20 managing general agents for small, specialized coverages.
Underwriting. RSUI’s underwriting philosophy is based on handling only product lines in which its underwriters have underwriting expertise. RSUI generally focuses on higher severity, lower frequency specialty risks that can be effectively “desk underwritten” without the need for inspection or engineering reviews. RSUI tracks underwriting results for each of its underwriters and believes that the underwriting systems and applications it has in place facilitate efficient underwriting and high productivity levels. Underwriting authority is delegated on a “top-down” basis ultimately to individual underwriters based on experience and expertise. This authority is in writing and addresses maximum limits, excluded classes and coverages and premium size referral. Referral to a product line manager is required for risks exceeding an underwriter’s authority.
Ratings. RIC, Landmark and Covington are each rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best and all three companies are rated “A+” by S&P. RIC and Landmark are rated A2 by Moody’s.
CapSpecialty
General. CapSpecialty, primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Capitol Indemnity Corporation, or “CIC,” Capitol Specialty Insurance Corporation, or “CSIC,” and Platte River Insurance Company, or “Platte River,” operates in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Through October 1, 2019, CapSpecialty also included the operations and results of Professional Risk Management Services, Inc., which was acquired from TransRe in 2014 and resold to TransRe effective October 1, 2019.
CIC conducts its property and casualty insurance business on an admitted basis throughout the U.S. CIC also writes surety products such as commercial surety bonds and contract surety bonds on a national basis. Commercial surety bonds include all surety bonds other than contract surety bonds and cover obligations typically required by law or regulation, such as licenses and permits. CIC offers contract surety bonds in the non-construction segment of the market which secure performance under supply, service and maintenance contracts.
CSIC conducts all of its business on an authorized, non-admitted basis nationally and writes primarily specialty lines of property and casualty insurance, including the professional lines of business.
Platte River is licensed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and operates in conjunction with CIC, primarily providing surety products and offering pricing flexibility in those jurisdictions where both CIC and Platte River are licensed.
AIHL Re and CapSpecialty entered into an intercompany reinsurance contract, effective July 1, 2015, pursuant to which AIHL Re provides CapSpecialty with coverage primarily for adverse development on certain net loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses, or “LAE,” in excess of its carried reserves at June 30, 2015. AIHL Re’s commitments are intended to cover the statutory collateral requirements at CapSpecialty, if and when necessary, and AIHL Re’s obligations are subject to an aggregate limit of $50.0 million. See Note 5(e) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the intercompany reinsurance contract.
 As of December 31, 2021, the statutory surplus of CIC was approximately $302 million, which included the statutory surplus of CSIC of approximately $64 million and the statutory surplus of Platte River of approximately $58 million, each as determined in accordance with SAP. As of December 31, 2021, the consolidated equity of CapSpecialty was $423 million, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
Distribution. CapSpecialty conducts its insurance business through independent wholesale brokerage and retail agents and general insurance agents located throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, CapSpecialty had 62 general agents licensed to write property and casualty and surety coverages, approximately 121 brokers specializing in professional liability coverages and approximately 249 independent agents licensed to write surety coverages only. Certain independent agents have binding authority for specific business owner policy products, including property and liability coverages and non-contract surety products.

Underwriting. Elements of CapSpecialty’s underwriting process include prudent risk selection, appropriate pricing and coverage customization. All accounts are reviewed on an individual basis to determine underwriting acceptability. CapSpecialty is a subscriber to the Insurance Service Organization, or “ISO,” and the Surety and Fidelity Association of America, or “SFAA,” insurance reference resources recognized by the insurance industry. CapSpecialty’s underwriting procedures, rates and contractual coverage obligations are based on procedures and data developed by ISO for property and casualty lines and by SFAA for surety lines. Underwriting acceptability is determined by type of business, claims experience, length of time in business and business experience, age and condition of premises occupied and financial stability. Information is obtained from, among other sources, agent applications, financial reports and on-site loss control surveys. If an account does not meet pre-determined acceptability parameters, coverage is declined. If an in-force policy becomes unprofitable due to extraordinary claims activity or inadequate premium levels, a non-renewal notice is issued in accordance with individual state statutes and rules.
Ratings. CIC, CSIC and Platte River are rated A (Excellent) by A.M. Best.
Alleghany Capital Segment

 2021 Alleghany Capital Product and Service Revenues
 
_______________
 (1)From May 10, 2021 through December 31, 2021.
 Corporate Activities
At the Alleghany parent company-level, we seek out attractive investment opportunities, including strategic investments in operating companies, delegate responsibilities to competent and motivated managers at the operating business-level, set goals for our operating businesses, assist managers in the achievement of these goals, define risk parameters and appropriate incentives for our operating businesses and monitor progress against their long-term objectives.
We own certain holding company investments and wholly-owned subsidiaries, including:
•Roundwood. Our public equity investments are managed primarily by Roundwood. 
 •Alleghany Properties. We own and manage properties in the Sacramento, California region through Alleghany Properties. These properties include primarily improved and unimproved commercial land, as well as residential lots. As of December 31, 2021, Alleghany Properties owned approximately 77 acres of property in various land use categories ranging from multi-family residential to commercial. 
 Prior to its sale on December 31, 2020, we also owned SORC. In June 2011, we formed SORC, an exploration and production company focused on enhanced oil recovery, headquartered in Golden, Colorado. From formation through December 31, 2020, we invested approximately $276 million in SORC. In the first half of 2020, SORC’s oil field assets were written down to estimated fair value, which primarily reflected a significant decline in oil prices, less costs to sell. In the second half of 2020, SORC’s oil field assets were sold at values that approximated their reduced carrying values.



Catastrophe Risk Management
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are exposed to natural catastrophe events, such as hurricanes, other windstorms, floods, wildfires and earthquakes, and man-made catastrophe events such as a major terrorist event, the bankruptcy of a major company or a marine or an aviation disaster. In 2020, we also incurred significant amounts of catastrophe losses arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic, or the “Pandemic.” These natural or man-made catastrophe events may expose our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to underwriting losses across multiple lines of business and, in any given year, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The extent of losses caused by catastrophes is a function of the amount and type of insured exposure in the area affected by the event, as well as the severity of the event, potentially mitigated by any reinsurance coverage purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries take certain measures to mitigate the impact of catastrophe events, including considering catastrophe risks in their underwriting and pricing decisions, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and managing exposure in key geographic zones and product lines that are prone to catastrophe events. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries also use reinsurance to further limit their exposure to catastrophes, as is discussed in more detail under “Reinsurance Protection” below.
We assess the probability of occurrence and severity of catastrophe events through the use of industry recognized models and other techniques. Where appropriate, we supplement these models with our own assessment of exposures which, in our view, may not be appropriately captured by these models. In addition, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries use modeled loss scenarios and internal analyses to set risk retention levels and help structure their reinsurance programs in an effort to ensure that single zone and aggregate catastrophe exposures conform to established subsidiary and group-level risk tolerances and fit within the existing exposure portfolio. We also leverage extensive multi-decade coverage and claims data gathered from our operations along with historical catastrophic event information and industry-recognized models to establish an appropriate price for insuring against future catastrophic events commensurate with the nature of such risks.
We consider how climate change may be changing the nature of storms as well as the frequency and potential severity. Our loss estimates for zonal and aggregate catastrophe exposures are updated and reviewed against tolerances as part of our risk oversight processes on a quarterly basis. Risk tolerances are subject to change based on our view of the risk-return characteristics of business being underwritten.
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries manage exposure to climate-related risks they underwrite in the following ways: (i) virtually all of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries’ insurance contracts that are exposed to natural catastrophes have contractual limits which cap their exposure to more severe than expected loss events; (ii) aggregations of risk are also closely monitored by region and peril, and we manage these aggregations by using traditional reinsurance or through the capital markets; (iii) contracts typically renew on an annual basis which allows our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to increase prices to reflect the changing risk environment, or exit contracts where adequate pricing cannot be achieved; and (iv) our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries hold substantial conservatively invested assets, which allow our subsidiaries to respond quickly to claims following severe loss events while still continuing to provide insurance coverage to their clients.
 There is no single standard methodology or set of industry standard assumptions to project possible losses related to catastrophe exposures and the form and quality of the data obtained, including data obtained from insureds and ceding companies, and used in these models are not uniformly compatible with the data requirements of all models. Therefore, the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. Finally, these modeled losses may not be comparable with estimates made by other companies.
Reinsurance Protection
General
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the risks they underwrite in order to reduce the effect of individual or aggregate exposure to losses, manage capacity, protect capital resources, reduce volatility in specific lines of business, improve risk-adjusted portfolio returns and enable them to increase gross premium writings and risk-capacity without requiring additional capital. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries generally purchase reinsurance and retrocessional coverages from highly-rated third-party reinsurers or on a collateralized basis. If the assuming reinsurers are unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the applicable reinsurance agreements, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries would remain liable for such reinsurance portion not paid by these reinsurers. As such, funds, trust agreements and letters of credit are held to collateralize a portion of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries’ reinsurance recoverables, and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the risks they underwrite or assume with multiple reinsurance programs. A summary of the more significant programs follows.
 TransRe enters into various retrocession arrangements, including property catastrophe retrocession contracts, to manage the effects of individual or aggregate exposure to losses, reduce volatility in specific lines of business, improve risk-adjusted

portfolio returns, strengthen its market position and enhance capital efficiency. These include excess-of-loss and quota share treaties in both traditional rated and collateralized form, as well as catastrophe bonds. TransRe’s retrocession protections generally have a one-year term and renewal dates occur throughout the year, with the majority renewing at January 1. The catastrophe bonds, however, have a four-year term, with maturities in 2022 and 2023.
 RSUI reinsures its property lines of business through a program consisting of surplus share treaties, facultative placements and per risk and catastrophe excess of loss treaties. RSUI’s catastrophe reinsurance program and property per risk reinsurance program each run on an annual basis from May 1 to the following April 30 and portions expired on April 30, 2021. Both programs were renewed on May 1, 2021 with substantially similar terms as the expired programs. RSUI reinsures certain portions of its casualty lines of business utilizing various quota share treaties and facultative placements.
 Terrorism Act
With respect to potential losses arising from acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as extended and amended, most recently by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which we collectively refer to as the “Terrorism Act,” established a program to provide federal assistance to the insurance industry in order to meet the needs of commercial insurance policyholders for coverages against losses due to certain acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Act fixes the insurer deductible at 20 percent of an insurer’s direct earned premium of the preceding calendar year. The Terrorism Act also initially fixed the federal share of compensation at 85 percent of insured losses that exceed insurer deductibles. As provided in the Terrorism Act, beginning on January 1, 2016, the federal share began to decrease by 1 percentage point per calendar year and it decreased on that basis until the federal share was equal to 80 percent as of January 1, 2020. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law a seven-year extension of the Terrorism Act continuing through December 31, 2027. The Terrorism Act is administered by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
The Terrorism Act applies to foreign or domestic acts of terrorism occurring within the U.S. (including in the U.S. territorial sea and the Outer Continental Shelf), at U.S. missions abroad or on U.S. flag vessels or aircraft. In return for requiring insurers writing certain lines of property and casualty insurance to offer coverage to commercial insurance policyholders against specified acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Act requires the U.S. federal government to reimburse such insurers for the federal share (80 percent, as of January 1, 2020) of insured losses during a program year resulting from such acts of terrorism above a statutorily-defined deductible. In addition, federal reimbursement will only be paid under the Terrorism Act if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a covered act of terrorism exceed $200.0 million for insured losses occurring in 2020 and for calendar years thereafter, but no payment will be made for any portion of aggregate industry insured losses that exceeds $100.0 billion during a particular calendar year.
In general, TransRe does not provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as defined by the Terrorism Act, but it is nonetheless exposed to potential losses related to both certified and uncertified acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere, such as from terrorism-specific treaty coverages offered to ceding companies or terrorism risk pools outside of the U.S. on a limited basis, and with respect to other lines of business from the assumption of terrorism risk in marine, aviation and other casualty treaties. Although TransRe assumes such terrorism risk after careful underwriting consideration and, in many cases, with limitations, a major terrorist event could have a material adverse impact on TransRe and us.
Approximately 16 percent of all policies and approximately 8 percent of property policies written by RSUI in 2021 contained coverage for domestic and foreign acts of terrorism. RSUI uses various underwriting strategies to mitigate its exposure to terrorism losses. In addition, its casualty reinsurance programs provide coverage for domestic and foreign acts of terrorism. RSUI’s property reinsurance programs provide coverage only for domestic acts of terrorism and, as a result, RSUI is liable for losses under property policies that provide coverage for foreign acts of terrorism, subject to potential Terrorism Act reimbursement.
Reinsurance Security Committee
We have established a Reinsurance Security Committee, which includes certain of our officers and the chief financial officers (or their designees) of each of TransRe, RSUI and CapSpecialty. The Reinsurance Security Committee meets to track, analyze and manage the use of reinsurance by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The Reinsurance Security Committee also considers and oversees the limits on the maximum amount of unsecured reinsurance recoverables that should be outstanding from any particular reinsurer, the lines of business that should be ceded to a particular reinsurer and, where applicable, the types of collateral that should be posted by a reinsurer. As of December 31, 2021, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries had total reinsurance recoverables of $2,196.0 million, consisting of $2,026.1 million of ceded outstanding loss and LAE and $173.1 million of recoverables on paid losses, less $3.2 million allowance for credit losses. The reinsurance purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries does not relieve them from their obligations to their policyholders and cedants and, therefore, the financial strength of their reinsurers is important. Approximately 66 percent of our reinsurance recoverables balance as of December 31, 2021 was due from reinsurers having an A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Excellent) or higher, with a majority of the other reinsurance recoverables being secured by funds held, trust agreements or letters of credit. As of December 31, 2021, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries had an allowance for credit losses of $3.2 million. Information

related to concentration of reinsurance recoverables can be found in Note 5(b) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Information regarding the risks faced by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries with respect to their use of reinsurance can be found on page 51 of this Form 10-K.
Competition
The reinsurance and insurance industry is highly competitive, and industry consolidation has created an even more competitive business environment. Competition in the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the company, premiums charged, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to producers, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines of business to be written.
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries compete with a large number of major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers and insurers in their selected lines of business, including regional companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, government-owned or subsidized facilities, European underwriting syndicates and diversified financial services companies. In our reinsurance segment, TransRe’s property and casualty businesses compete on a worldwide basis. In our insurance segment, RSUI’s property and casualty businesses, and CapSpecialty’s admitted casualty businesses and surety and non-admitted specialty businesses, compete on a national basis. Some of these competitors have significantly more premiums, capital and resources than our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries.
In addition to competition from the reinsurance industry, TransRe faces competition from the capital markets, as well as some traditional reinsurers, which from time to time produce alternative products or reinsurance vehicles (such as collateralized reinsurance, reinsurance securitizations, catastrophe bonds and various derivatives, such as swaps and sidecars) that may compete with certain types of reinsurance, such as property catastrophe. Hedge funds also provide reinsurance and retrocessional protections through captive companies or other alternative transactions on a fully collateralized basis for property and energy catastrophe business. Over time, these initiatives could significantly affect supply, pricing and competition in the reinsurance industry. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may also compete with new entrants into the reinsurance and insurance markets, including companies with new or “disruptive” technologies or business models.
 A discussion of the risks faced by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries due to competition within, and the cyclicality of, the reinsurance and insurance businesses can be found on page 50 of this Form 10-K.
The various industries in which Alleghany Capital’s subsidiaries operate are highly competitive, though the nature and degree of such competition varies greatly by company and industry. Competition is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength, expertise and reputation of the company, the quality and timeliness of the goods and services being provided, prices charged for goods and services and other contractual terms and conditions associated with the sale of goods and services.
 Human Capital
Alleghany Parent. Alleghany’s focus on creating long-term value for all of Alleghany’s stakeholders, including our employees, informs our culture, strategy and compensation. The Alleghany parent company comprises a small group of highly-experienced professionals and additional support staff. In general, our professionals have all been recruited mid-career, and we benefit from the accumulated expertise they have achieved before coming to Alleghany. From a culture perspective, although we must offer competitive compensation, we do not seek to compete for executive talent solely on the basis of compensation. We also compete by offering a unique professional opportunity to work in a high-integrity environment where the focus is on building stockholder value over the very long term. Our collaborative, team-oriented culture is a key driver of retention. Our retention efforts, which include compensation aspects, result in parent-level employees with long tenures, which fits with our long-term financial results orientation.
 Subsidiary Level. Given the small number of parent-level executives and employees, Alleghany’s subsidiaries employ over 99% of our consolidated employees. Alleghany Capital’s subsidiaries have employees across a diverse group of businesses and sectors, including: (i) hotel services (Concord); (ii) manufacturing (W&W|AFCO Steel, Wilbert, Kentucky Trailer, Piedmont and PCT); (iii) engineering and related consulting services (IPS); and (iv) product design, development and marketing (Jazwares).
As shown in the charts on page 37 of this form 10-K, most of the employees at our Alleghany Capital subsidiaries are involved in manufacturing or hotel services. Concord, which has the most employees of any of our subsidiaries, has a strong reputation as one of the most employee-centric businesses in the hotel services sector, and has a number of initiatives that aim to build on its reputation.
 Safety. The safety of all of our employees is our highest priority. Across our organization, we are committed to conducting business in a manner that protects the health, safety and security of our employees. Given our intense focus on safety, each board meeting of an Alleghany Capital subsidiary starts with a report on key safety statistics. Among the safety-related statistics that we monitor is the “Days Away Restricted or Transferred” rate, or “DART,” as promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health

Administration, or “OSHA.” When expressed as the rate of incidents per 100 full-time equivalent employees at the Alleghany Capital subsidiary, DART incidents ranged across subsidiaries from 0.1 to 3.7 for 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our DART metrics at Alleghany Capital’s subsidiaries for the trailing 12 months were determined to be lower than their most relevant industry benchmark, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 To ensure that our employees remain safe from the Pandemic, commencing in 2020, we undertook and continue to undertake extensive measures. For all of our offices, hotels, factories and other facilities, we have taken and continue to take a number of steps to enhance the safety of the physical environment and reduce the risk of infection to our employees, including but not limited to:
 •implementing a hybrid working environment where applicable;
 •improving air filtration;
 •implementing social distancing guidelines;
 •encouraging employee vaccination;
 •implementing policies for any unvaccinated employees or workplace visitors;
 •requiring the use of face coverings; and 
 •enhancing hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures. 
 We are also committed to a work environment that is free of threats, intimidation and physical harm. We provide our subsidiaries with access to training resources on handling complaints and investigations, and preventing workplace violence and bullying.
 Diversity and Inclusion. We believe diversity and inclusion is an integral part of achieving our business and financial objectives by helping create a high performing and resilient culture. We strive to be an organization that shares common values and goals, while at the same time respecting the broad differences among us. We prohibit discrimination by or against any person on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, creed, religion, religious affiliation, age, sex, pregnancy, maternity, caring responsibility, marital status, civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, disability, veteran status, or any other status that is protected under applicable law. In accordance with our Employee Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our employees from senior executives to entry-level employees, we are committed to a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment of any kind and prohibit all such conduct. We recruit, select, train, promote and compensate based on merit, experience and other work-related criteria. We comply with all laws governing fair employment and labor practices.
We have made an effort in recent years to have a more diverse employee base. In 2020, we engaged a global consulting firm with expertise in issues of diversity and inclusion, and with their guidance in 2021 we hired our first Vice President-People and Inclusion Officer within the Alleghany management team to drive our strategy around people and inclusion. We continue to collect and analyze more detailed demographic data across the organization with a view to monitor the success of our diversity and inclusion efforts.
We also support the objective of a diverse board of directors and have continued to enhance the diversity of the board composition in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, one-third of our board of directors was female and one-third of our board of directors was ethnically diverse.
 Talent Acquisition, Development, and Retention. Hiring, developing and retaining employees is important to our operations, and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth, performance and retention. We prioritize the continued professional and personal development of our employees through formal programs and events, support of continuing education, and on-the-job learning and knowledge-sharing. We believe our investment in training and development support contributes to an increased level of job satisfaction and retention as employees feel more empowered to perform their job functions. Internal mentoring and coaching is at the heart of the learning and development approach at our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries capitalize on the skills, talents, and knowledge of their employees by facilitating frequent information sharing across different functions and teams within each organization. This is further supplemented by more formal training and developmental programs.


Employee Count. As of December 31, 2021, we had 13,313 employees, as presented below, compared with 10,407 as of December 31, 2020. The vast majority of our employees are located in the U.S. The increase in our employees as of December 31, 2021 relates primarily to the continued recovery in 2021 from the Pandemic-driven reductions in staffing that Concord experienced in 2020, as well as the impact of IPS’s acquisition of Linesight and the addition of Piedmont, as noted previously. Our total annualized revenue per employee was approximately $0.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
 

As of December 31, 2021, Alleghany Capital and its subsidiaries had 11,926 employees, as presented below.
 

Regulation
General
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate and are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations applicable to reinsurance and insurance companies, although the degree and type of regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We expect the scope and extent of regulation globally, as well as regulatory oversight generally, to continue to increase. The material regulations under which we operate are described below.
U.S. Regulation
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are regulated in all U.S. jurisdictions in which they are licensed to conduct business. The extent of this regulation varies, but state insurance laws and regulations generally govern the financial condition of reinsurers and insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentrations of permissible investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy. In addition, state insurance laws and regulations govern the business conduct of insurers, including marketing and sales practices and claims handling and require the approval of nearly all rates, policy forms and related materials for lines of insurance. U.S. insurance regulation generally aims to protect policyholders and to ensure that insurance companies remain solvent.
 Insurance Holding Company Regulation. As an insurance holding company, we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws enacted in those states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or where they conduct business. These laws generally require insurance companies controlled by a holding company to register and file with their domestic insurance regulators information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, including dividends and distributions and general business operations.
The insurance holding company laws of some states, including with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions, may be more restrictive than the insurance holding company laws of other states. Under these laws, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may not pay an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution without the prior approval of the domestic state insurance regulators. The insurance laws of New York, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, which represent some of our domiciliary states, utilize a more restrictive “lesser than” calculation for determining whether a distribution constitutes an extraordinary dividend, thereby requiring prior regulatory approval. In New York, for instance, an extraordinary dividend means a dividend which, together with all dividends declared during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of 10 percent of the insurer’s surplus to policyholders as shown by its latest filed statement, or 100 percent of adjusted net investment income during such period. In contrast, the insurance laws of other states, such as Delaware and Nebraska, where certain of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, utilize a less restrictive “greater than” test for extraordinary dividend calculations. In Delaware, for example, an extraordinary dividend includes any dividend, together with other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, that exceeds the greater of: (i) 10 percent of such insurer’s surplus as regards to policyholders as of the preceding year end; or (ii) the net income, excluding realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the preceding year end. In addition, certain states where Alleghany’s reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled prohibit a domestic insurance company from paying ordinary and extraordinary dividends except out of earned surplus.
In addition, insurance holding company laws and regulations to which we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject generally require prior notification and approval or non-disapproval by the domiciliary insurance regulators of certain other significant transactions, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements and service agreements between an insurance subsidiary, on the one hand, and its holding company or other subsidiaries of the holding company, on the other hand.
Insurance holding company laws and regulations to which we and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are subject also generally require the ultimate controlling person of the reinsurer or insurer to comply with certain informational requirements with the purpose of protecting such reinsurer or insurer from enterprise risk, including requiring the ultimate controlling person to file with the group’s lead state insurance regulator an annual enterprise risk report (also known as a Form F) that identifies the risks within the insurance holding company system that could have a material impact on the financial condition or liquidity of the reinsurer or insurer or the entire insurance holding company system.
 The insurance holding company laws and regulations of the states in which our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled also generally require that, before a person can acquire direct or indirect control of a reinsurer or an insurer domiciled in the state (or any person controlling such domestic reinsurer or insurer), prior written approval must be obtained from the insurer’s domiciliary state insurance regulator. In determining whether to approve a person’s direct or indirect acquisition of control over an insurance company, the state insurance regulators are required to consider various factors, including the financial strength of the acquirer, the integrity and management experience of the acquirer’s board of directors and executive officers and the acquirer’s plans for the future operations of the reinsurer or insurer. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, “control” over a reinsurer or an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power

to vote or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of that reinsurer or insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares of the ultimate controlling person’s common stock.
The acquisition of control laws described above may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.
Risk Management. All U.S. states have enacted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, or "ORSA," Act, which requires reinsurers and insurers that exceed certain specified premium thresholds to maintain a framework for managing the risks associated with their entire holding company group, including non-insurance companies. These laws also require that, at least annually, the reinsurer or insurer must prepare a summary report, or the “ORSA Report,” regarding its internal assessment of risk management and capital adequacy for the entire holding company group. The ORSA Report is filed, on a confidential basis, with the insurance holding company group’s lead state regulator and made available to other domiciliary regulators within the holding company group.
Corporate Governance. The Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act has also been adopted by all U.S. states. It requires reinsurers and insurers to disclose detailed information regarding their governance practices.
Group Supervision and Group Capital. In response to international developments, state insurance holding company laws have established procedures for the supervision of domestic and international insurance groups, including those groups with both insurance and non-insurance entities. These laws authorize U.S. regulators to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups.
Additionally, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the "NAIC," has adopted a group capital calculation tool using a risk-based capital, or “RBC,” aggregation methodology, or “AM,” for all entities in an insurance holding company system. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all companies regardless of their structure. The NAIC adopted the group capital calculation methodology and amendments to the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act which implement the annual filing requirement for the group capital calculation. These amendments have to be adopted by state legislatures to become effective, including in the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors, or "IAIS," will evaluate the AM for comparability to the insurance capital standard that the IAIS is developing as part of its Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups and the Holistic Framework, as discussed below under “International Regulation – Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives.” The outcome of this comparability determination may impact our international operations and the overall competitiveness of the U.S. domestic (re)insurance industry.
 Pandemic Risk. There has been no formal action with respect to reinsurance and insurance coverage of Pandemic risk at the NAIC or at the federal level in the U.S. In 2020, many government agencies and insurance regulators issued regulations, bulletins and directives in connection with the Pandemic, including states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries have business operations or conduct reinsurance and insurance business. Our insurance subsidiaries were also required to provide additional reporting and assist policyholders, such as by providing premium reductions as warranted, although these requirements are no longer in effect. Also in 2020, several states proposed mandating retroactive coverage of Pandemic related business interruption losses. To date however, none of these proposals has meaningfully progressed or been enacted. At the federal level, there are ongoing discussions around a federal response to the risk of future pandemics, some of which include proposals to create public-private partnerships with insurers. It is too early to determine which proposal may ultimately gain the support of Congress, if any, and how any new legislation might affect our business operations.
 Cybersecurity. The NAIC has adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which, when adopted by the states, will require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under such laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors. The Insurance Data Security Model Law has been adopted by several states, including some of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. In addition, certain states are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity on reinsurance and insurance companies (potentially including reinsurance and insurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services, or the “NYDFS,” adopted a regulation requiring banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction to implement reasonable cybersecurity measures, effective as of March 1, 2017, the "NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation," which applies to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries that are domiciled or licensed in New York. We are also subject to the cybersecurity provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or “CCPA.” The CCPA includes a broad private right of action in the case of the breach of California consumers’ personal data stemming from a company’s failure to implement reasonable security measures. The potential risk with respect to CCPA may be limited by the scope of the law, which excludes data subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or “GLBA.” However, this is not an entity-wide exception and a breach of personal information subject to the CCPA and not covered by the GLBA could be a significant source of liability risk. We are subject to regulations promulgated

under the GLBA, including the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Rule, or “Safeguards Rule.” The Federal Trade Commission, or the "FTC," announced significant amendments to the Safeguards Rule in 2021 to require covered financial institutions to implement specific data security measures in their information security programs. Failure to comply with the amended Safeguards Rule when it comes fully into effect in October 2022 may result in enforcement action, which represents a potential future liability risk.
 Rates and Policy Forms. The policy forms and various premium rates and rates for property or casualty or surety insurance policies of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in every state in which they conduct business. In many states, rates and policy forms must be filed with the applicable insurance regulator prior to their use, and in some states, rates and forms must be affirmatively approved by the applicable insurance regulator prior to use.
The rates and coverage terms of reinsurance agreements with non-affiliates are generally not subject to regulation by any governmental authority. As a practical matter, however, the rates charged by primary insurers and the policy terms of primary insurance agreements may affect the rates charged and the policy terms under associated reinsurance agreements.
Market Conduct Examinations. The insurance laws and regulations to which our insurance companies are subject govern their marketplace activities, affecting the form and content of disclosure to consumers, product illustrations, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices and complaint and claims handling. These provisions are generally enforced through periodic market conduct examinations. Such insurance laws and regulations also govern the licensing of insurance companies and agents and regulate trade practices.
Periodic Financial Reporting and Risk-Based Capital. Reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. are required to report their financial condition and results of operations in accordance with SAP prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulators in conjunction with the NAIC. State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial examinations of reinsurers and insurers, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, establish standards for permissible types and amounts of investments and require minimum capital and surplus levels. These statutory capital and surplus requirements include RBC rules promulgated by the NAIC. These RBC standards are intended to assess the level of risk inherent in a reinsurance or an insurance company’s business and consider items such as asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and other business risks relevant to its operations. In accordance with RBC formulas, a company’s RBC requirements are calculated and compared with its total adjusted capital to determine whether the company may be undercapitalized and whether regulatory intervention is warranted. As of December 31, 2021, the total adjusted capital of our U.S. domiciled reinsurance and insurance companies exceeded the minimum levels required under applicable RBC rules, and each had excess capacity to write additional premiums in relation to these requirements. Specifically, as of December 31, 2021, the amount of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements was not significant in relation to the actual statutory capital and surplus of our reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S.
The NAIC annually calculates certain statutory financial ratios for most reinsurance and insurance companies in the U.S. These calculations are known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or “IRIS,” ratios. There are thirteen IRIS ratios for property/casualty insurers, with each ratio having an established “usual range” of results. The IRIS ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio falling outside the usual range is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. The NAIC reports the ratios to state insurance departments that may then contact a company if four or more of its ratios fall outside the NAIC’s usual ranges. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are not currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on their respective IRIS ratios.
Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements. Certain U.S. insurance companies are required under the guaranty fund laws of most states in which they transact business to pay assessments up to certain prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Our U.S. insurance companies are also required to participate in various involuntary pools, principally involving windstorms.
Statutory Accounting Principles. State insurance regulators have developed SAP as a basis of accounting used to monitor and regulate the solvency of reinsurers and insurers. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring a reinsurer’s or insurer’s surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, SAP focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of a reinsurer or insurer at financial reporting dates in accordance with applicable insurance laws and regulations in the state in which such reinsurer or insurer is domiciled. SAP determines, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries and thus determines, in part, the amount of funds they have available to pay as dividends.
GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, but it is also concerned with other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. Due to differences in methodology between SAP and GAAP, the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP are materially different from those reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with SAP.

Federal Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. As discussed in more detail under “Reinsurance Protection” above, the Terrorism Act established a federal assistance program to help the commercial property and casualty insurance industry cover claims arising from terrorism-related losses and regulates the terms of insurance related to the terrorism coverage provided by our insurance companies.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the “Dodd-Frank Act,” made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and required various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of implementing rules and regulations.
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or the “FSOC,” comprising the heads of federal agencies including the SEC, Comptroller of the Currency, U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, to identify and respond to risks to the financial stability of the U.S. and to promote market discipline. The FSOC is authorized to designate a nonbank financial company as “systemically significant,” or a “non-bank SIFI,” if its material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the U.S. A non-bank SIFI is subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as well as enhanced prudential standards, including stress tests, liquidity requirements, annual resolution plans or “living wills,” and enhanced public disclosures. There are currently no such non-bank SIFIs designated by the FSOC.
 The FSOC changed its process for designating non-bank SIFIs, effective in January 2020, by adopting an activities-based approach and moving away from the entities-based approach. This change of measures to address systemic risk in the insurance industry could affect our reinsurance and insurance operations as could a determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Federal Insurance Office, or the “FIO,” within the U.S. Department of the Treasury which is designed to promote national coordination within the insurance sector and which has the authority, in part, to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues or gaps in the regulation of reinsurers and insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the U.S. financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the FIO to assist the Secretary of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in negotiating “covered agreements” with foreign jurisdictions regarding prudential measures for the supervision of global reinsurance and insurance markets. A covered agreement may preempt a state law if the FIO determines that the state law is inconsistent with a covered agreement’s terms and treats a non-U.S. reinsurer or insurer less favorably than a U.S. reinsurer or insurer.
Covered Agreements and Credit for Reinsurance. Currently, our non-U.S. reinsurance companies are indirectly subject to the effects of regulatory requirements imposed by the states in which their U.S. ceding insurers are domiciled. Under current U.S. law, an insurer is permitted to take credit on its statutory financial statements for the loss, expense or reserve obligations of its reinsurers if the reinsurer is licensed, accredited or approved in the U.S. insurer’s state of domicile or if the reinsurer posts collateral for the sole benefit of the U.S. insurer equal to 100% of the reinsurer’s obligations. Additionally, all states permit a U.S. insurer to take credit for reinsurance ceded to a non-U.S. reinsurer that posts collateral in amounts less than 100% of the reinsurer’s obligations if the reinsurer has been designated as a “certified reinsurer” and is domiciled in a country recognized by the state and the NAIC as a “Qualified Jurisdiction.” The reduced percentage of full collateral applied to a certified reinsurer is based upon an assessment of the reinsurer and its financial ratings.
In January 2017, the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced their successful completion of negotiations of a covered agreement with the EU, the Bilateral Agreement Between the United States and European Union on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance, or the "U.S./ EU Covered Agreement," which was signed on September 22, 2017. The U.S./EU Covered Agreement addresses three areas of prudential insurance and reinsurance supervision: (i) group supervision; (ii) reinsurance; and (iii) the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. The U.S./EU Covered Agreement eliminates the requirement for EU reinsurers to post reinsurance collateral in order for their U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance. In order to be eligible for zero collateral treatment, an EU reinsurer must meet certain standards including, among others, minimum capital and solvency ratios, confirmation of financial condition by the reinsurer’s domestic regulator and claims payment standards. The U.S./EU Covered Agreement may preempt an inconsistent state law that treats EU reinsurers less favorably than a U.S. reinsurer. In addition, the U.S./EU Covered Agreement establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups operating in both territories. For instance, the U.S./EU Covered Agreement provides that U.S. insurance groups with operations in the EU will be supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators (and precludes EU insurance supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of U.S. insurers for a sixty-month period), provided those U.S. regulators apply a group capital assessment calculating risk at the worldwide group level.
On December 20, 2018, in anticipation of the U.K.’s pending exit from the EU, the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that they had signed an additional covered agreement with the U.K., the Bilateral Agreement Between the United States of America and the United Kingdom on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance, or the "U.S./U.K. Covered Agreement." The U.S./U.K. Covered Agreement largely reflects the provisions of the U.S./EU Covered Agreement and incorporates the same timeframes contained within it. We expect that, if successfully

implemented, the U.S./U.K. Covered Agreement will resolve some of the regulatory uncertainty following Brexit (as defined below) for U.S. reinsurers writing business in the U.K., as well as U.K.-based reinsurers writing business in the U.S.
 Under the terms of both the U.S./EU Covered Agreement and U.S./U.K. Covered Agreement, together, the "Covered Agreements," as of September 1, 2022, state credit for reinsurance laws that result in non-U.S. reinsurers subject to the Covered Agreements being treated less favorably than U.S. reinsurers may be preempted by the applicable covered agreement. Accordingly, on June 25, 2019, the NAIC adopted amendments to the NAIC’s Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Model Regulation, or the "Credit for Reinsurance Models," to conform to the requirements of the Covered Agreements, which will become an NAIC accreditation standard as of September 1, 2022, with enforcement beginning on January 1, 2023. This has set the stage for each state to revise its credit for reinsurance laws in order to avoid federal preemption of its laws. As of October 27, 2021, 46 jurisdictions had adopted the amended Credit for Reinsurance Models.
The 2019 amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Models afford zero reinsurance collateral treatment to qualifying reinsurers from "Reciprocal Jurisdictions" which include: (i) non-U.S. jurisdictions that entered into a covered agreement with the U.S. (currently the EU and the U.K.); (ii) non-U.S. jurisdictions that are Qualified Jurisdictions, as described above, and also comply with certain additional requirements consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, including the elimination of a requirement that a U.S.-domiciled reinsurer maintain a local presence in the Qualified Jurisdiction in order to assume reinsurance from a ceding insurer domiciled in the non-U.S. jurisdiction and recognize the U.S. statutory regulatory approach to group supervision; and (iii) all U.S. jurisdictions that are accredited by the NAIC. The NAIC has designated Bermuda, Japan and Switzerland as "Reciprocal Jurisdictions" and accordingly, qualifying reinsurers domiciled in these countries are eligible for zero collateral treatment under the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Models. We cannot currently estimate the impact of changes to the laws and regulations as a consequence of any such adopted covered agreements on our business, financial condition or operating results.
 Financial Risks Relating to Climate Change. The topic of climate risk has come under increased scrutiny by insurance regulators. In September 2020, the NYDFS issued a circular letter to New York domestic and foreign authorized insurers, which applies to certain of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, stating that the NYDFS expects insurers to integrate financial risks related to climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes and business strategies.
In addition, the NYDFS issued final guidance on November 15, 2021 regarding its expectations for New York domestic insurers related to the management of financial risks from climate change, which guidance applies to TRC and Fair American Insurance and Reinsurance Company, or "FAIRCO." Insurers are expected to manage these risks by outlining actions that are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their businesses. For instance, the guidance states that an insurer should: (i) incorporate climate risk into its financial risk management (e.g., including in its ORSA); (ii) manage climate risk through its enterprise risk management functions and ensure that its organizational structure clearly defines roles and responsibilities related to managing such risk; (iii) use scenario analysis when developing business strategies and identifying risks; and (iv) incorporate the management of climate risk into its corporate governance structure at the group or insurer entity level. In terms of timing, a company must have specific plans to implement the NYDFS’s expectations related to board governance and organizational structure by August 15, 2022, and the NYDFS will issue additional guidance on the timing for implementing the more complex expectations.
 The NYDFS also adopted an amendment to the regulation that governs enterprise risk management, effective as of August 13, 2021, that requires an insurance group to include certain additional risks, such as climate change risk, in its enterprise risk management function. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries continue to monitor the climate change related guidance and expectations from the NYDFS. Adopting these and other related requirements from the NYDFS as well as forthcoming requirements from other insurance regulators could involve substantial additional resources and increased costs of compliance in future periods.
 NYDFS Guidance on Diversity and Corporate Governance. Insurance regulators are also focused on the topic of race, diversity and inclusion. On March 16, 2021, the NYDFS issued a circular letter stating that it expects the insurers it regulates to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance.
 International Regulation
General. TransRe is regulated in various foreign jurisdictions where it conducts business. In certain jurisdictions, TransRe operates through branches or representative offices of TRC and in other jurisdictions TransRe has local reinsurance or insurance subsidiaries, such as TRL in the U.K. and TRESA in Luxembourg.
The extent of the regulation varies by foreign jurisdiction, but generally governs licensing requirements, solvency, currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves and amount and type of local investments. International operations and assets held abroad may be materially and adversely affected by economic, political and other developments in foreign countries and the U.S., including possible changes in foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, unexpected financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose and potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, as well as by the consequences of

international hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. International operations are also subject to risks related to complying, or monitoring compliance, with the requirements of anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and the economic and trade sanctions laws of the U.S., including but not limited to the regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, or “OFAC,” and sanctions laws implemented by other countries in which TransRe operates. Further, regulations governing technical reserves and remittance of balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets. A discussion of risks unique to international operations faced by TransRe’s offices that operate in jurisdictions outside the U.S. can be found on pages 53 through 55 of this Form 10-K.
The laws and regulations of a number of the foreign jurisdictions in which our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, including the U.K., Luxembourg and Gibraltar, also generally require that, before a person can acquire direct or indirect control of a reinsurer or an insurer domiciled in that jurisdiction (or any person controlling such reinsurer or insurer), prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance regulator in that jurisdiction. In determining whether to approve a person’s direct or indirect acquisition of control over an insurance company, the insurance regulators are required to consider various factors, including the reputation and financial strength of the acquirer, the integrity and management experience of the acquirer’s board of directors and executive officers and the acquirer’s plans for the future operations of the reinsurer or insurer. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, “control” over a reinsurer or an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly holds 10 percent or more of the shares or 10 percent or more of the voting power of that reinsurer or insurer, or shares or voting power which enables that person to exercise significant control over the management of the reinsurer or insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the shares or voting power of the ultimate controlling person.
 U.K. Regulation. Prior to December 2013, TransRe’s operations in the U.K. were only conducted through a branch of TRC. Since December 2013, TransRe’s operations in the U.K. have been conducted by both TRL and TRC’s branch in the U.K. TRL and TRC’s operations in the U.K. are supervised by the Prudential Regulatory Authority, or the “PRA,” which is responsible, among other things, for regulating the solvency of insurance and reinsurance companies, and the Financial Conduct Authority, or the “FCA,” which is responsible, among other things, for regulating market conduct. The PRA and the FCA have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of a regulated entity, including the power to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of its rules by authorized firms and approved persons. TRL and TRC’s branch in the U.K. are each required to maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of the business conducted in accordance with PRA and FCA rules. The calculation of the margin of solvency depends on the type and amount of reinsurance business written, the type and amount of reserves held and other risk-related factors, including market risk, counterparty default risk and operational risk.
Luxembourg Regulation. TRESA is licensed to carry on reinsurance business in Luxembourg. As a result, TRESA is required to comply with The Law of 7 December 2015 on the Insurance Sector and the regulations and guidance issued by the Financial Supervisory Authority, or the “Commissariat aux Assurances.” Some of the significant aspects of the Luxembourg regulatory framework include complying with capital and solvency, corporate governance, risk management and internal control requirements. In addition, TRESA is subject to annual reporting requirements enacted by Commissariat aux Assurances.
Branch Regulation. TRC operates in a number of other jurisdictions through a series of foreign branches, including branches in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, France, Japan, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, the U.K., Switzerland and Singapore, and TRESA operates in Switzerland, Germany, France and Dubai through branches. As a result, TRC and TRESA are required, among other things, to meet local licensing, reserve, currency, investment and capital requirements as applicable for these branches.
Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. Our reinsurance and insurance business throughout the EU is subject to an EU directive known as “Solvency II,” and its implementing rules, which have been in effect since January 1, 2016. The Solvency II regulatory regime is built on a risk-based approach to setting capital requirements for (re)insurers and seeks to: (i) enhance transparency and risk management; and (ii) encourage a proactive approach to company solvency. Certain aspects of Solvency II are likely to change in the near future. The European Commission, assisted by the provision of technical input from the European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority or “EIOPA," has undertaken a review of Solvency II and on September 22, 2021 published a package of proposed legislative reforms for amending the existing regulatory framework. This proposed legislation is now being discussed by the European Parliament and Council.
TransRe could be materially impacted by the ultimate outcome of this review of Solvency II, which may reduce the regulatory solvency position of TRESA and/or the EU branch of TRC. For example, these entities could be impacted by increased capital requirements or a reduction in eligible funds. Any changes to Solvency II could also materially impact the wider TransRe group, given that Solvency II affects the calculation of the solvency of international groups which, like TransRe, conduct reinsurance and insurance operations both inside and outside of the EU. In addition, TransRe could be required to undertake a significant amount of additional work if compliance with the Solvency II regime came into question, which in turn may divert finite resources from other business related tasks.
 Further, TransRe’s EU business could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption of any new rules which amend the common standards that EU Member States must adopt for authorizing and supervising EU branches of third country
43


reinsurers, or “Third Country Reinsurers.” TRC operates on a cross-border basis within the EU as a Third Country Reinsurer through its third country branch in France. Currently, this branch of TRC does not experience any significant impact on its operations. However, in the future, TRC may be required to post additional collateral in EU countries or may need to consider restructuring its business in order to comply with new rules adopted in EU countries related to Third Country Reinsurers.
 Other potential regulatory risks that may affect TransRe's EU business include the introduction of more complex and intensive regulatory reporting burdens, regulatory requirements that conflict with requirements in other jurisdictions, and shortages of skilled staff in critical areas such as the actuarial function, all of which may have a negative impact on the results of TRC, TRESA and the TransRe group.
 TransRe's U.K. business may be affected by the U.K.’s departure from the EU, or “Brexit," on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period on December 31, 2020, following which TransRe's U.K. operations lost their European Economic Area financial services passporting rights. The relationship between the U.K. and the EU is now governed by the terms and conditions of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the "Trade Agreement," which does not contain many substantive provisions relating to financial services. Similarly, it is not expected that the Memorandum of Understanding, or the "MOU," relating to financial services that has been concluded by the U.K. and the EU will materially alter this position, if it is ever formally entered into by the parties. The MOU is, instead, expected to establish a Joint U.K.-EU Regulatory Forum that will serve as a platform to facilitate dialogue between the parties on financial services issues.
In addition, the U.K.'s regime governing the prudential regulation and governance of (re)insurers could change in the near future, which would increase the potential for divergence between the U.K. and EU prudential regimes following Brexit. The U.K.’s HM Treasury has concluded a period of consultation with industry stakeholders on proposed changes of certain rules that have largely been transposed from Solvency II. HM Treasury is now expected to work with the PRA to prepare a package of reforms for consultation in early 2022. TRL and TRC’s branch in the U.K. could be materially impacted by this review. Additional information on the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit can be found on page 55 of this Form 10-K.
 In Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, People’s Republic of China and India, emerging markets where TransRe underwrites business on a cross-border basis, local regulations have recently been adopted that may operate to limit, restrict or increase the costs of TransRe’s access to these markets. If this trend continues to spread to other jurisdictions, TransRe’s ability to operate globally may be materially and adversely affected.
In addition to regulation within the U.S., the EU, the U.K. and the other non-U.S. jurisdictions where TransRe operates, we may be affected by regulatory policies adopted by the IAIS. Regulators in more than 200 jurisdictions and approximately 140 countries, representing both established and emerging markets, are working with the IAIS to consider changes to reinsurer and insurer solvency standards and group supervision of companies in a holding company system, including non-insurance companies. Current IAIS initiatives include development of a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or “ComFrame,” which has been in progress since 2010. ComFrame is intended to provide a global framework of basic standards for internationally active insurance groups, or “IAIGs,” and a process for supervisors to cooperate in the supervision of IAIGs. A final form of ComFrame was formally adopted in November 2019 at the IAIS Annual General Meeting. Included in ComFrame was a risk-based, group-wide global insurance capital standard, or “ICS.” Work on the ICS began in October 2013, and ICS Version 2.0 was adopted in November 2019 and a five-year monitoring period began in January 2020. During the monitoring period, ICS Version 2.0 will not trigger any supervisory action, but will be used for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges to provide feedback to the IAIS on the ICS design and performance.
In 2018, the IAIS announced that it would commence development of a Holistic Framework for the Supervision of Insurance Companies. This Holistic Framework also was adopted in November 2019 and was implemented from the beginning of 2020. This framework recognizes that systemic risk can arise both from sector-wide trends with regard to specific activities and exposures, as well as from a concentration of these activities and exposures in individual insurers. The Holistic Framework consists of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures and powers of intervention, an annual IAIS global monitoring exercise and collective discussion on the outcomes and appropriate supervisory responses.
 Regulatory Convergence
Regulators within and outside the U.S. are increasingly coordinating the regulation of multinational insurers by conducting a supervisory college. A supervisory college, as defined by the IAIS, is “a forum for cooperation and communication between the involved supervisors established for the fundamental purpose of facilitating the effectiveness of supervision of entities which belong to an insurance group; facilitating both the supervisor of the group as a whole on a group-wide basis and improving the legal entity supervision of the entities within the insurance group.” We continue to assess the impact, if any, such coordination may have on insurance regulation and our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The NYDFS advised TransRe to expect its inaugural Supervisory College in September of 2022.
 Reserves
Each of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries establishes reserves on its balance sheet for unpaid loss and LAE related to its property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts. The reserves for loss and LAE represent management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the balance sheet date. The process of estimating these reserves is inherently difficult and involves a considerable degree of judgment, especially in view of changing legal and economic environments that impact loss reserve development. Therefore, quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations and managerial judgment. In addition, conditions and trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect liability development to the same degree in the future. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our estimation process for the liability for unpaid loss and LAE.
Information on prior year loss reserve development and incurred and paid loss and LAE development by segment can be found in Note 6(b) and Note 6(c), respectively, to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
The following table presents the reconciliation of the aggregate net loss and LAE reserves of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance departments prepared in accordance with SAP and those reported in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP for the three years ended December 31, 2021.

    See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the loss and LAE reserves of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries.
 Asbestos-Related Illness and Environmental Impairment Reserves
Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries’ reserves for loss and LAE include amounts for risks related to asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment. The reserves carried for such claims, including the reserves for loss and LAE incurred but not reported, or “IBNR,” claims, are based upon known facts and current law at the respective balance sheet dates. However, significant uncertainty exists in determining the amount of ultimate liability for asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment losses. This uncertainty is due to, among other reasons, inconsistent and changing court resolutions and judicial interpretations with respect to underlying policy intent and coverage and uncertainties as to the allocation of responsibility for resultant damages. Further, possible future changes in statutes, laws, regulations, theories of liability and other factors could have a material effect on these liabilities and, accordingly, future earnings. Although we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves, which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, may be necessary in the future, we believe that our asbestos-related illness and environmental impairment reserves were adequate as of December 31, 2021.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the reserves for asbestos-related illness liabilities were approximately ten and eleven times, respectively, the average paid claims for the respective prior three year period. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the reserves for environmental impairment liabilities were approximately nine and seven times, respectively the average paid claims for the respective prior three year period.
The following tables present the reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross reserve balances for unpaid loss and LAE related to asbestos–related illness and environmental impairment claims of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries for the three years ended December 31, 2021.
