ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
Overview
MMA Capital Holdings, Inc. focuses on infrastructure-related investments that generate positive environmental and social impacts and deliver attractive risk-adjusted total returns to our shareholders, with an emphasis on debt associated with renewable energy projects. Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “MMA,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to MMA Capital Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. We were originally organized as a Delaware limited liability company in 1996, converted to a Delaware corporation on January 1, 2019 and are externally managed by Hunt Investment Management, LLC (our “External Manager”), an affiliate of Hunt Companies, Inc. (Hunt Companies, Inc. and its affiliates are hereinafter referred to as “Hunt”). 
Our current objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in the large, growing and fragmented renewable energy market in the United States (“U.S.”). We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of these and other investment opportunities because of our External Manager’s origination network built off of extensive relationships and credit expertise gathered through years of experience. We also seek to increase the Company’s return on equity by prudently deploying debt and recycling equity out of lower yielding investments that are unrelated to renewable energy and other infrastructure-related projects. 
In addition to renewable energy investments, we continue to own a limited number of bond investments and real estate-related investments, and we continue to have subordinated debt with beneficial economic terms. Further, we have significant net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) that may be used to offset future federal income tax obligations, a portion of which were reported as deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. 
We operate as a single reporting segment.

COVID-19 and Related Business Impacts
General
In many countries, including the U.S., the outbreak of COVID-19 and the actions taken in response have adversely impacted overall economic activity and contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak continues to evolve as many countries, including the U.S., continue to institute or modify quarantines, business closures and operating restrictions, governmental agency closures and restrictions on travel and group gatherings to contain COVID-19.
The impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance has been modest to date but the long-term impact will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread, intensity and variability of COVID-19, the availability and acceptance of effective vaccines and other measures taken to control it, all of which remain uncertain and difficult to predict. While we are not able to estimate the long-term effects of these factors on our business at this time, the adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be material. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Report for additional information about risks to our business that are posed by COVID-19.
Business Operations
We are managed by our External Manager. We also rely upon other third-party vendors to conduct business operations, including vendors that provide information technology services, legal and accounting services or other support services.
As of December 31, 2020, there were no disruptions to the services provided by the External Manager and support provided by other third parties in connection with our business operations.

Renewable Energy Investments
As of December 31, 2020, the construction and development of most of the renewable energy projects that have been financed through loans made by the Solar Ventures (as defined below) were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the development and construction of these projects qualified as critical infrastructure or essential services. Furthermore, projects that were financed by loans made by the Solar Ventures did not experience any significant supply chain issues or construction delays during the year ended December 31, 2020. Lastly, origination activity at the Solar Ventures was not meaningfully impacted by COVID-19 during the year. 
As further discussed below, certain components of the national and some local renewable energy finance markets have been, and may further be, affected by changing market dynamics, resulting in supply and demand imbalances, particularly for tax equity investments. These market dynamics may materially and negatively impact the Solar Ventures’ loan portfolio. 

All loans made by the Solar Ventures are reported at fair value based upon the net present value of such instruments, which was estimated by applying discount factors that reflect market yields for similar credit risks to future contractual payments associated with such loans. The anticipated timing of near-term redemptions and underlying project values were also considered in such fair value measurements. The total fair value of loans outstanding at December 31, 2020, approximated their total UPB at such reporting date. 

Other Investments and Hedging Instruments
The Company’s 80% ownership interest in a joint venture, which owns a mixed-use town center development that consists of hotel tenants, retail tenants and undeveloped land parcels and whose incremental tax revenues secure our tax-exempt municipal bond (“Infrastructure Bond”) (hereinafter, the “SF Venture”), was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired during the preparation of our second quarter financial statements as of June 30, 2020, given the impacts of the downturn in the economy and local and state restrictions on retail tenants stemming from COVID-19. As such, this investment was written down to its fair value at June 30, 2020, using valuation inputs that were sourced from a third-party specialist. Consequently, the Company recognized a $9.0 million impairment loss in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, this investment was assessed to be other-than-temporary impaired at December 31, 2020, and, therefore, was written down to its fair value at such reporting date. In this regard, an additional $3.7 million impairment loss was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020 that partially offset $4.7 million of equity in income of the SF Venture that was recognized in the same reporting period that stemmed primarily from the termination of a lease with an anchor tenant, which accelerated the amortization of a below-market lease intangible liability into rental income. Refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for more information about income that was recognized in connection with this investment.
We continue to monitor the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of our investments and underlying real estate values. Although we have not recognized impairment charges other than that for the SF Venture discussed above, we believe it is reasonably possible that we may be required to recognize one or more material impairment charges over the next 12 months, particularly if underlying economic conditions deteriorate further. Because any such impairment charge will be based on future circumstances, we cannot predict at this time whether we will be required to recognize any further impairment charges and, if required, the timing or amount of any impairment charge.
Hedging instruments used by the Company to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks have performed in accordance with the contractual terms.
DTAs
While COVID-19 caused a sharp deterioration in macro-economic conditions, the potential amount and permanence of long-term impacts of those conditions on the Company’s business was uncertain at December 31, 2020. Given such uncertainty and other factors, we believe it is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, a reduction to the net carrying value of DTAs that is material to the Company’s financial statements could be recognized. However, whether we recognize such a loss, the exact timing and amount of loss recognition depends upon future circumstances and, therefore, cannot be predicted at this time.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During the year ended December 31, 2020, COVID-19 has not prevented us from operating our business and making investments. However, we continue to have limited liquidity and rely on our capital partner for disproportionate funding contributions in connection with certain of our renewable energy investments. Our capital partner has continued to show a willingness to increase its commitment to the Solar Ventures, but the Company continues to consider our funding risk when assessing our liquidity and capital resources. 
At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
Renewable Energy Investments
We invest in loans that finance renewable energy projects to enable developers, design and build contractors and system owners to develop, build and operate renewable energy systems throughout the U.S. Renewable energy debt in which we invest is primarily structured as senior secured fixed rate loans that are made through joint ventures or directly on our balance sheet. We generally target loans that are short-term in nature, and that are typically made to borrowers when they are in the late stages of development or in construction of their commercial, utility or community solar scale photovoltaic (“PV”) facilities, but we may also make longer duration loans to these borrowers to finance completed facilities. These facilities are located across different states and benefit from various state and federal regulatory programs. The short duration of loans in which we have typically invested help us to manage interest rate risk, mitigate long-term risks such as credit exposure to off-take counterparties and provides us flexibility to target investments. However, there have been and there may in the future be opportunities to originate longer-dated investments that would potentially provide greater insight into our future earnings.
We generally invest in renewable energy investments through the following joint ventures: Solar Construction Lending, LLC (“SCL”); Solar Permanent Lending, LLC (“SPL”); and Solar Development Lending, LLC (“SDL”). Together with our wholly owned subsidiary, Renewable Energy Lending, LLC (“REL”), these joint ventures are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Solar Ventures.” We are a 50% investor member in the renewable energy joint ventures in which we invest, although we may periodically have a minority economic interest as a result of non-pro rata capital contributions made by our capital partner pursuant to non-pro rata funding agreements between our capital partner and us. Such non-pro rata funding agreements are generally executed in instances when the Company does not have sufficient liquidity at the time of a capital call. Distributions from the Solar Ventures generally are made in proportion to the members’ respective economic interests but may be made disproportionately to our capital partner, when our capital partner has made non-pro rata capital contributions, until such time that the amount of equity invested by the Company and its capital partner have come back into equal balance. 
Investment Interests and Related Carrying Values
At December 31, 2020, through MMA Energy Holdings, LLC (“MEH” or “Borrower”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, we held minority economic interests of 45.2%, 45.0% and 42.3% in SCL, SPL and SDL, respectively. At December 31, 2019, the Company held 42.0%, 50.0% and 41.5% economic interests in SCL, SPL and SDL, respectively. The Company is the sole member in REL. The carrying value and income-related information related to investments that we have made in, or related to, the Solar Ventures are further discussed below. 
Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company and its capital partner in SCL and SDL funded various non-pro rata capital contributions, whereby our capital partner contributed the full $10.0 million in SCL capital calls and $102.0 million of $127.0 million in SDL capital calls, while the Company contributed the balance of these capital calls, or $25.0 million. In addition, our capital partner received distributions of $13.0 million in SCL, while the Company received distributions of $25.0 million. As a consequence of these non-pro rata capital contribution and distributions, our economic interest in SCL and SDL, as of March 24, 2021, decreased to 38.4% and 37.3%, respectively.
Table 1 provides financial information about the carrying value of the Company’s renewable energy investments at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

The carrying value of the Company’s equity investments in the Solar Ventures increased $74.0 million during 2020 as a result of $34.4 million of net capital contributions made and $39.6 million of equity in income from the Solar Ventures that was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. Returns on equity investments in the Solar Ventures are further discussed below.
Lending Activities of the Solar Ventures - General
The Solar Ventures typically lend on a senior secured basis collateralized by solar projects, but may also invest in subordinated loans, mezzanine loans and revolving loans and may finance non-solar renewable technologies such as wind and battery storage, or provide equipment financing and other customized debt solutions for borrowers. The Solar Ventures have historically targeted loans that are underwritten to generate internal rates of return (“IRR”) ranging from 10% to 15%, before expenses, with origination fees that range from 1.0% to 3.0% on committed capital and fixed-rate coupons that range from 7.0% to 14.0%. These loans typically range in size from $2 million to over $50 million and may exceed $100 million for utility scale projects. 
Since their inception in 2015, the Solar Ventures have invested in more than 200 project-based loans that total $3.4 billion of debt commitments for the development and construction of over 780 renewable energy project sites. When completed, these projects are expected to contribute to the generation of over 9.4 gigawatts of renewable energy, thereby eliminating approximately 268.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions over their project lives. The Solar Ventures closed $1.1 billion of commitments across 35 loans during 2020 as compared to $999.0 million across 62 loans during 2019. 
At December 31, 2020, loans funded through the Solar Ventures had an aggregate unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of $701.2 million and fair value (“FV”) of $702.6 million, a weighted-average remaining maturity of 17 months and a weighted-average coupon of 12.4%. At December 31, 2019, loans funded through the Solar Ventures had an aggregate UPB and FV of $654.4 million, a weighted-average maturity of 10 months and a weighted-average coupon of 10.8%. The FV of loans made by the Solar Ventures is generally measured for reporting purposes based upon the net present value of such instruments, which is estimated by applying discount factors that reflect market yields for similar credit risks to future contractual payments associated with such loans. The anticipated timing of near-term redemptions and underlying project values are also considered for such purpose.

At December 31, 2020, the Solar Ventures had $261.7 million of unfunded loan commitments that required borrowers to meet various conditions set forth in governing loan agreements in order for funding to occur. Based upon our 50% interest in these ventures, and various non-pro rata capital contribution agreements, $114.7 million of such commitments were attributable to the Company. Unfunded loan commitments that qualify for funding are anticipated to be funded primarily by capital within the Solar Ventures through a combination of existing loan redemptions and uninvested capital. Uninvested capital or capital shortfalls may arise due to the difficulty of aligning the timing of loan repayments with funding obligations on a dollar-for-dollar basis. To the extent capital within the Solar Ventures is not sufficient to meet their funding obligations, additional capital contributions by the members of the Solar Ventures would be required.
Certain components of the national and some local renewable energy finance markets, such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”), have been and may further be affected by changing market dynamics, resulting in supply and demand imbalances. These market dynamics may materially and negatively impact the Solar Ventures’ loan portfolio in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the availability and pricing of tax equity and the deterioration of underlying project value if the price of electricity falls due to competition or waning demand and a project has merchant exposure to variable market prices. Furthermore, energy generated by renewable energy projects is dependent upon suitable weather conditions and should unfavorable weather conditions be sustained or particularly severe, there may be significant supply and demand imbalances, or power production deficiencies, either of which could cause a significant increase in the price of power and a decrease in the availability of power, which may also cause merchant exposure to variable market prices to the extent power production agreements are not met. This could further impact the availability and pricing of tax equity or permanent take-out financing and result in a deterioration of the underlying project value. The Solar Ventures’ concentration in ERCOT could further impact when invested capital is repaid and re-invested. 
At December 31, 2020, all but two renewable energy projects, both of which are located in the ERCOT service area and were financed by three loans from the Solar Ventures that had a total UPB of $214.3 million, had usual and customary take-out commitments in place as generally required under the loan agreements. In most cases, the repayment of the Solar Venture loans, or their “take-out,” is dependent upon the refinancing of a loan made by the Solar Ventures or the sale of the underlying renewable energy project to third parties, both of which typically require some combination of tax credit equity, sponsor equity and construction or permanent debt financing. The Solar Ventures may themselves participate in the take-out of such loans by providing financing, including long-term mezzanine financing or other credit enhancements. Additionally, the Solar Ventures may increase the size of funding commitments or extend the contractual maturity of loan receivables as necessary to preserve the value of loan investments made. Given the macro-economic conditions, uncertainty in the financial markets and our dependence on a functioning renewable energy finance market, we continue to closely monitor loan performance and expected sources of repayment. As further discussed below, the two projects that, at December 31, 2020, did not have usual and customary take-out commitments are under construction or development in the ERCOT service area. On March 2, 2021, a take-out commitment was secured for one of these projects (“ERCOT Project 2”) that is under development and for which the total UPB of related development and mezzanine financing was $44.7 million at December 31, 2020, while we are in discussions to resolve any defaults and provide for the future ownership and operation of another project (“ERCOT Project 3”) that is under construction and for which the total UPB of related development and mezzanine financing was $169.6 million at December 31, 2020.
Lending Activities of the Solar Ventures – ERCOT Exposures
At December 31, 2020, 55.9% of the total UPB of outstanding loans of the Solar Ventures were associated with a single sponsor and were secured by three projects located in the ERCOT service area. On February 24, 2021, our economic interest in loans related to these three projects became 45.0%, and is expected to remain as such, based upon a non-pro rata capital contribution agreement executed with our capital partner. 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, a renewable energy project in the ERCOT service area to which the Solar Ventures made construction and mezzanine loans, which had aggregate UPBs of $295.5 million and represented 39.6% of the total UPB of the loan portfolio of the Solar Ventures at September 30, 2020, began operational activities and was recapitalized with tax-equity and term debt provided by third parties and a $177.5 million sponsor equity loan provided by SPL (“ERCOT Project 1”). The renewable energy joint ventures provided certain guarantees of indemnity and project sponsor performance obligations to third parties to facilitate this recapitalization, which resulted in the full repayment of the Solar Ventures’ construction and mezzanine loans and reduced the Solar Ventures’ total loan commitment exposure to this project by $110.5 million. At December 31, 2020, the sponsor equity loan represented 25.3% of total UPB of the Solar Ventures’ loan portfolio and is categorized as a permanent loan in Table 2.

During the second and third weeks of February 2021, a severe winter storm occurred in the southern and midwestern states in the U.S., including the ERCOT service area, that impaired the operational capabilities of numerous fossil fuel and renewable energy generating assets in the region. Extreme cold temperatures also caused the demand for electricity to surge to unprecedented levels, driving the market price of power to the maximum price permitted by ERCOT for multiple days. Weather conditions during this timeframe caused ERCOT Project 1 to be unable to meet its energy delivery requirements to its counterparty pursuant to various energy supply and pricing agreements. As a result, ERCOT Project 1 became obligated to purchase, at market prices in effect during that time, an amount of power equal to the shortfall in the electricity volumes that it was contractually obligated to deliver. The party which manages ERCOT energy deliveries and payments on behalf of ERCOT Project 1 under its supply agreements thereafter provided notification on March 10, 2021, that the net settlement cost associated with the power delivery shortfall during that period totaled $25.5 million. The project pledged $3.0 million of cash; however, given the liquidity constraints of the project and the sponsor member it is expected that they will be unable to meet the remaining net settlement payment. As a result, the Company and our capital partner expect that they will provide the capital to SPL to enable the project to satisfy its net settlement payment obligation of $22.5 million as well as any additional payment obligations, that may be required in connection with or to facilitate the final closing of the recapitalization of the ERCOT Project 1 in the fourth quarter of 2020 upon substantial completion of the project. Due to the project’s value, its capital structure and other repayment risk factors, we believe that recovery of these additional advances expected to be made by SPL would be at significant risk and, consequently, a related fair value loss is expected to be recognized by SPL in the first quarter of 2021 that, taken together with interest income that is not expected to be accrued during such reporting period (as further discussed below), could result in a substantial decrease in SPL’s net income. 
On March 2, 2021, SDL and SCL executed loan amendments and other agreements to facilitate the take-out of a development loan provided by SDL and of the allocated portion of a mezzanine loan provided by SCL, which are financing ERCOT Project 2. To mitigate risk and reduce exposure to this project, SDL and SCL agreed to waive all interest and fees on the repayment of SDL’s development loan and an allocated portion of SCL’s mezzanine loan which, at December 31, 2020, had a combined UPB of $44.7 million including the capitalization of $7.6 million of interest and fees, and further agreed to provide $30.2 million of bridge construction loan proceeds to the project in anticipation of an expected sale of the project to a prospective buyer by May 15, 2021. These agreements also provided the prospective buyer with a mezzanine loan facility of up to $9.0 million, the proceeds of which can be utilized upon the closing to refinance the existing development loan and allocated portion of the mezzanine loan. The terms of any such new mezzanine loan are subject to final negotiation, approvals and documentation. Additionally, in consideration for its waiver of interest and fees on this development loan, as part of this loan’s restructuring SDL will, upon closing, have the ability to recover up to $4.0 million of foregone interest and fees through a participation interest, subject to the prospective buyer receiving a specified rate of return on its investment. All loans will be reported at fair value and, given loan-related concessions made, a mark-to-market loss and other reductions in net income are expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2021 by SDL and SCL and such impacts could be substantial. 
On January 12, 2021, a notice of default was issued by SDL in connection with a development loan made to ERCOT Project 3 that had a UBP and fair value of $160.3 million and $168.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020, because the loan was past its maturity date with no take-out commitment in place. During the first quarter of 2021, $80.1 million of additional advances were made in connection with this loan to continue to fund the project’s construction activities and keep it on schedule to meet its target mechanical completion date. Discussions to resolve any defaults associated with this loan and provide for the future ownership and operation of this project are currently in process.
The ERCOT market remains volatile and uncertain primarily stemming from the February 2021 weather event and resulting energy crisis. There is litigation among various market participants and potential legislative reform is being considered, all of which remain uncertain. Assuming that the Company was unable to recover any of the additional advances made to ERCOT Project 1 (as outlined above), the Company’s allocable share of losses in the first quarter would, when taken together with loan-related interest income that is not expected to be accrued and other impacts stemming from the aforementioned actions taken to maximize the recovery of loans made to ERCOT Project 2, be $23.3 million, or approximately $4.00 per share (such loss would be recognized by the Company as a reduction in equity in income of the Solar Ventures). However, it is difficult to estimate first quarter impacts related to these exposures in absence of, among other things, the completion of fair value measurements of loans outstanding at the Solar Ventures at March 31, 2021, which require various valuation inputs that were not available as of the filing date of this Report. Further, additional events may occur that could cause this estimate to change by amounts that could be material.

Loan Portfolio Redemptions and Returns at the Solar Ventures
Through December 31, 2020, $2.3 billion of commitments across 159 project-based loans had been repaid with no loss of principal, resulting in a weighted-average IRR (“WAIRR”) to the Solar Ventures of 19.7% that was on average higher than originally underwritten loan IRRs. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 48 loans totaling $1.0 billion of commitments had been repaid, resulting in a WAIRR of 23.0% to the Solar Ventures. The WAIRR was disproportionately increased during the year ended December 31, 2020, by one loan that provided an extraordinary IRR. Excluding this loan, the above WAIRR would have been 15.3% and 13.0%, respectively. WAIRR is measured as the total return in dollars of all repaid loans divided by the total commitment amount associated with such loans, where (i) the total return for each repaid loan was calculated as the product of each loan’s IRR and its commitment amount and (ii) IRR for each repaid loan was established by solving for a discount rate that made the net present value of all loan cash flows equal zero. WAIRR at the Solar Ventures has been higher than the net return on the Company's investments in the Solar Ventures because it is a measure of gross returns earned by the Solar Ventures on repaid loans and does not include the impact of certain items, including: (i) operating expenses of the Solar Ventures; (ii) the amortization of the purchase premium paid by the Company in the second quarter of 2018 to buy out our former investment partner’s interest in REL; and (iii) the opportunity cost of uninvested capital. 
At December 31, 2020, the Solar Ventures had two loans on non-accrual status. Such loans were associated with ERCOT Project 1 and ERCOT Project 2, which had a combined UPB of $188.2 million. The Solar Ventures did not recognize $1.5 million of interest income in 2020.
Returns on Renewable Energy Investments
The Company applies the equity method of accounting to its equity investments in the Solar Ventures, which are not consolidated by the Company for reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Company recognizes its allocable share of the Solar Ventures’ net income based on the Company’s weighted-average percentage ownership during each reporting period. Separately, the Company recognizes interest income associated with the aforementioned loan using the interest method.
Table 3 summarizes income recognized by the Company in connection with our renewable energy investments for the periods presented.

The Company generated an unlevered net return on investment from our renewable energy investments, as measured on a twelve-month trailing basis, of 11.5% and 11.4% for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These returns were measured on a trailing four quarter basis at each reporting period by dividing total income from renewable energy investments by the average carrying value of renewable energy investments.

The Company generated a leveraged net return on investment from our renewable energy investments, as measured on a twelve-month trailing basis, of 14.6% and 13.9% for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. These returns were measured on a trailing four quarter basis at each reporting period by dividing net income from renewable energy investments less attributed cost of funding (as further described below) by a net average value that incorporates the carrying value of renewable energy investments, the UPB of attributed funding and restricted cash associated with attributed funding (where the UPB of attributed funding partially reduces the other two components in such net value).

Leveraging our Renewable Energy Investments
On September 19, 2019, MEH, entered into a $125.0 million (the “Facility Amount”) revolving credit agreement with various lenders. During the first quarter of 2020, the maximum Facility Amount was increased to $175.0 million and the committed amount of the revolving credit facility increased from $100.0 million to $120.0 million upon the joinder of an additional lender and an increase in commitment by one of the existing lenders. 
Obligations associated with the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the Company and are secured by specified assets of the Borrower and a pledge of all of the Company’s equity interest in the Borrower through pledge and security documentation. Availability and amounts advanced under the revolving credit facility, which may be used for various business purposes, are subject to compliance with a borrowing base comprised of assets that comply with certain eligibility criteria, and includes late-stage development, construction and permanent loans to finance renewable energy projects and cash.
Borrowing on the revolving credit facility bears interest at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), adjusted for statutory reserve requirements (subject to a 1.5% floor), plus a fixed spread of 2.75% per annum. The Borrower has also agreed to pay certain customary fees and expenses and to provide certain indemnities. In certain circumstances where the interest rate is unable to be determined, including in the event LIBOR ceases to be published, the administrative agent to the credit agreement will select a new rate in its reasonable judgment, including any adjustment to the replacement rate to reflect a different credit spread. The maturity date of the credit agreement is September 19, 2022, subject to a 12-month extension solely to allow refinancing or orderly repayment of the facility. 
The UPB and carrying value of amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility was $103.7 million and $94.5 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Company recognized $5.8 million and $1.2 million of related interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 
The liquidity accessed by the Company through the revolving credit facility since its inception has increased the amount of capital invested in the Solar Ventures. 

Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. DTAs are recognized if we assess that it is more likely than not that tax benefits, including NOLs and other tax attributes, will be realized prior to their expiration. 
At December 31, 2020, the Company had pretax federal NOLs of $358.9 million that were available to reduce future federal income taxes. These NOLs will begin to expire in 2028. As of December 31, 2020, the Company concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it was more likely than not that the Company would utilize $215.2 million of these NOLs. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized an incremental $2.9 million net DTA. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Company’s net DTA was $59.1 million while a $63.4 million valuation allowance was established in connection with that portion of federal and state NOL carryforwards that were expected as of such reporting date to expire prior to utilization. Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 14, “Income Taxes,” for additional information about DTAs.
Investments in Bonds 
The Company has one tax-exempt municipal bond that financed the development of infrastructure for a mixed-use town center development in Spanish Fort, Alabama and is secured by incremental tax revenues generated from the development. At December 31, 2020, this Infrastructure Bond had a stated fixed interest rate of 6.3% and had a UPB and fair value of $26.4 million and $24.7 million, respectively. During the second quarter of 2020, a financing transaction was executed that involved the sale of this bond investment to a third-party with which the Company contemporaneously-executed a total return swap (“TRS”) agreement that also referenced such bond investment. Given the economic interest retained in

such bond investment through the TRS agreement, the Company reported the conveyance of such investment as a secured borrowing and, therefore, continued to recognize the Infrastructure Bond on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
At December 31, 2020, we also held one subordinated unencumbered tax-exempt multifamily bond investment with a UPB and fair value of $4.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

Real Estate-Related Investments
At December 31, 2020, we maintained an interest in a real estate-related investment through our 80% ownership interest in the SF Venture. The carrying value of this investment was $11.2 million at December 31, 2020. 
At December 31, 2020, we also owned one direct investment in real estate consisting of a parcel of land that is currently in the process of development. This real estate is located just outside the city of Winchester in Frederick County, Virginia. During the year of 2020, the Company invested $7.1 million in additional land improvements that were capitalized, increasing the carrying value of our investment. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of this investment was $15.5 million. 
At December 31, 2020, the Company maintained an 11.85% ownership interest in the South Africa Workforce Housing Fund (“SAWHF”). SAWHF is a multi-investor fund that matured in April 2020. However, the fund does not anticipate fully exiting all its remaining investments until December 31, 2022. On May 22, 2020, the Company received a pro-rata distribution from SAWHF of 7.2 million common shares of a residential real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is listed on the Main Board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. These REIT shares, which trade under the trading symbol “TPF,” are reported at their fair value and are denominated in South African rand. The carrying values of the Company’s equity investments in SAWHF and the REIT were $1.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020.
The carrying values of our real estate-related investments are not necessarily indicative of the price we would receive upon a sale of those assets which would be affected, possibly materially, by the then-current macroeconomic and microeconomic market conditions, including the matters described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Other Debt Obligations
At December 31, 2020, the Company had other debt obligations that included subordinated debt, notes payable and other debt used to finance certain non-interest bearing investments and asset related debt that was used to finance interest bearing investments. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company closed a $10.0 million lending arrangement that is secured by our direct investment in the Frederick County, Virginia property and a $23.5 million financing arrangement associated with its Infrastructure Bond investment. The carrying value and weighted-average yield of the Company’s other debt obligations was $134.1 million and 2.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Refer to Table 9, “Debt,” within Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information.
Competition
We face competition from banks, private equity, infrastructure funds and other renewable energy investors related to new investments. Also, the properties that collateralize our bonds and real estate related investments compete against other companies and properties that seek similar tenants and offer similar services.
While we have historically been able to compete effectively as a result of our service, reputation, access to capital and longstanding relationships, many of our competitors benefit from substantial economies of scale in their business, have greater access to capital and other resources than we do and may have other competitive advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we are able to. 
Human Capital Resources
We have no employees. The Company engaged our External Manager to manage the Company’s continuing operations on January 8, 2018, and all former employees of the Company were at that time hired by the External Manager.
