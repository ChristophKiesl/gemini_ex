Overview
Pluralsight is a leading cloud-based technology skills development platform committed to closing the global technology skills gap. Learners on our platform can acquire today’s most valuable technology skills through high-quality learning experiences delivered by subject-matter experts. Real-time measurement and assessment of a learner’s performance on our platform provides technology leaders with visibility into the capabilities of their teams and confidence their teams will deliver on critical objectives. Our platform empowers teams to keep up with the pace of technological change, puts the right people on the right projects, and boosts productivity. 
Many companies still use traditional in-person, instructor-led training, or ILT, models, which do not move fast enough or scale quickly enough to meet the ever-evolving customer expectations and the pace of technological change. We are disrupting these traditional skill development models to provide organizations with the skill development they need, when they need it, because learning should not be confined to a classroom, a “one size fits all” curriculum, or to a select minority of people. 
With Pluralsight Skills, individuals and teams can quickly acquire today’s most valuable technology skills through high-quality skill development experiences, such as skill assessments, a curated library of expert-authored courses, directed learning paths, interactive content, and business analytics. Our platform is powered by Iris, our proprietary machine-learning driven skill and role assessment algorithm and recommendation engine, which enables businesses to more effectively quantify and develop skills across technologies. Through our platform, we provide businesses with visibility into strengths of their workforce, allowing them to better align resources, provide targeted skill development and advance the skills of their teams. 
In 2019, we acquired GitPrime and rebranded it as Pluralsight Flow, which gives technology leaders objective data and visibility into workflow patterns to measure the productivity of their software developers. Pluralsight Flow aggregates data from code commits, pull requests and tickets, and packages this data into actionable metrics. It gives technology leaders a data-driven view of their development process to enable their teams to be more successful by debugging development processes and resolving bottlenecks.
Together, our products enable teams to develop, measure and deploy critical skills at scale and deliver products faster. We provide businesses with visibility into the strengths of their workforce, allowing them to better align resources, provide targeted skill development, and advance the skills of their teams. Ultimately, our mission is to democratize technology skills.
Closing the global technology skills gap requires more than success in our commercial business. That is why we created Pluralsight One, our social impact initiative, committed to serving marginalized populations that our commercial business will not reach. Refer to our “Social Impact” discussion in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In recent years, we reached significant scale in users and our customer base, which span over 180 countries across the globe. As of December 31, 2019, we had 17,942 business customers, including over 980,000 business users, compared to approximately 810,000 business users as of December 31, 2018. Our customers include 70% of the 2019 Fortune 500. 
We achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our revenue totaled $316.9 million, $232.0 million, and $166.8 million, respectively, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%, 39%, and 27%, respectively. Our revenue from business customers for the same periods was $271.8 million, $188.2 million, and $125.3 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 44%, 50%, and 41%. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, was $163.6 million, $146.8 million, and $96.5 million, respectively, which reflects our substantial investments in the future growth of our business.
Our Platform
Our platform provides businesses the solutions that they need to upskill teams into modern roles and improve workflow efficiency. The key components of our platform’s products, Pluralsight Skills and Pluralsight Flow, include:
Pluralsight Skills

• | Skill and Role Assessments: Our assessment tool uses machine learning and advanced algorithms to measure a user’s skills, benchmark that user against others in the industry, and recommend opportunities for growth. Users are provided with a Skill IQ that quantifies if a user is a novice, proficient, or expert within technologies such as AngularJS, C#, and Java. Role IQ allows our users to quantify and develop a collection of skills that are required for success in technology roles. This provides greater clarity around the technology skills required for a specific job role and a clear path to concept mastery. For example, we have Role IQ’s for several roles including: Security Analyst, React Web Developer, and Cloud Architect. Skills assessments can be mapped to a defined role in order to benchmark a user’s technical proficiency against what is required to master that role. We provide a modern skill assessment experience that gives businesses a credible, adaptable, and efficient model for validating technology skills.


• | Course Library: Our course library includes a digital ecosystem of thousands of on-demand courses across a range of technology subject areas, including cloud, mobile, security, IT, and data. Video courses, or videos, are organized by modules and clips and are searchable, so users can either take an entire course or target an area for a specific need. The majority of our courses are transcribed, and once transcribed, are available with closed captioning in over 100 languages. We built our exclusive course library primarily by engaging our world-class community of subject-matter experts, or authors, who create content for us and share in our success by receiving revenue-share amounts based on the viewing of their content. In addition, our platform offers interactive courses with an in-browser developer environment that allows users to practice as they learn through coding challenges with real-time feedback. Interactive courses provide a hands-on learning experience to apply knowledge outside of the course library in order to assess concept mastery. Our projects feature extends the practice modules to the user’s local coding environment, allowing users to apply knowledge to real-world, on-the-job scenarios.


• | Paths: Based on either an assessment or a user’s goals, our directed learning paths are personalized to take users through a set of courses designed to help them master a particular subject area and not spend time reviewing content that they already know. Businesses can customize learning paths to meet company-specific objectives and roles.


• | Business Analytics: Our business analytics tools enable business customers to index the technology skills of their teams, align learning to key business objectives, determine the usage of our platform, examine trends in skill development, and quantify the impact of our platform on their business.

Pluralsight Flow

• | Pluralsight Flow aggregates historical git data to provide insights and reports to software developers and their leaders. The metrics within Pluralsight Flow visualize code commits and code reviews to help leaders and teams observe dynamics and patterns in the code development process. Code commit metrics show leaders the time software developers spend on reworking legacy code by providing concrete data around commit risk and code churn. Code review metrics evaluate productivity and help leaders observe team dynamics and patterns in the code review process. Team collaboration metrics help leaders manage knowledge distribution and teamwork dynamics that may be impacting cycle times and software code quality.

Key Benefits of Our Platform
We developed our platform to empower businesses to enable smarter, more efficient workers and to drive innovation in this period of digital transformation. Key benefits of our platform include the following:
High quality, curated content
We believe we have the most relevant course library for the greatest number of technology professionals. Our content is the product of our industry-leading authors. We spent many years identifying, cultivating, and growing our author network, and over 1,500 authors have contributed to our current course library. One of the primary challenges for businesses and individuals seeking to enhance technology skills is finding the right resources. We address that challenge for them. Our extensive relationships within the developer and technical communities allow us to source and retain the best subject-matter experts to produce relevant content for our users. We provide quality assurance on our authors’ expertise through our selection process and by having our in-house technology professionals and practitioners, as well as other authors, perform reviews on 
the quality and effectiveness of all content before it is published to our platform. This content curation ensures our users are receiving high-quality, consistent results from our platform.
We conduct a thorough, strategic analysis of current job postings and leverage the knowledge of our on-staff subject matter experts and author community to determine the most in-demand tech roles, skills and technologies. The benefit of working with job posting data and continuous, qualitative input from our on-staff curriculum team is that we readily identify shifts in the market and pivot our content strategy accordingly. These factors help us identify which roles, skills and technologies are most needed, and how often they appear in the workplace, which enables us to prioritize content creation and determine the depth and breadth of content supporting these in-demand skills. 
Align skill development to learning styles and business needs
We view skill development as a holistic process. Our integrated platform combines skill and role assessments, a curated library of expert-authored courses, directed learning paths, business analytics, interactive courses, and projects to ensure that learners are taking the courses most useful to them and demonstrating comprehension of the subject matter. Through our skill assessment engine, powered by Iris, we are able to assess the proficiency of a user in a role or a topic through adaptive tests and provide a Skill IQ or Role IQ. By gathering such insights from our platform, businesses can understand skills gaps, benchmark employees against consistent standards, and address skill development needs in an efficient and targeted manner.
Obtain visibility into team skills and efficiencies
Our two-product platform provides teams with a 360-degree approach to increasing efficiency and accelerating product development. With Pluralsight Skills and Pluralsight Flow together, teams can benchmark technical proficiency against their priorities, upskill into the roles they need and monitor their workflow patterns to deliver innovations on time and under budget. Our platform supports the technologist in his or her entire journey from skill gap discovery to skill development to skill application and back again as technology continues to evolve. 
Cost effective technology skills platform
We believe our pricing model provides a significant cost advantage compared to traditional technology skill development offerings. As our customers’ industries and business models evolve, they require a learning solution that helps them deliver key innovations with demanding time and budgetary constraints. Our business subscriptions published pricing ranges from $579 to $779 per user per year for Pluralsight Skills, providing what we believe to be a significant cost advantage over ILT and alternative solutions. In addition, our platform can be deployed with little to no implementation or other professional services required, as evidenced by substantially all of our revenue to date being derived from the sale of subscriptions to our platform.
Our Pluralsight Flow solution is priced similarly to Pluralsight Skills at $499 to $699 per year per active contributor to a customer’s code base. We believe the insights provided by Pluralsight Flow promote work efficiencies, which drive cost savings to our customers.
Optimized for on-demand accessibility
We offer our content the way users want to consume it. Our cloud-based technology skills platform is an on-demand solution that allows globally distributed users to access courses anytime they want from almost any device, maximizing utilization of our product and workplace efficiency. Our mobile applications are available on iOS and Android operating systems, and our desktop application is available on Mac and PCs. Courses can be temporarily downloaded and viewed offline. Our platform allows users to participate and take notes while watching our courses. These applications allow our users to take our courses when convenient for them.
Our platform is designed for the professional technologist but it can be used by anyone, at any skill level, who has an interest in improving their technology skills. We offer a range of courses from novice to expert skill levels, with significant granularity within each topic so users can access the content most relevant to their specific needs. We utilize a cloud-based delivery model that enables us to regularly make new content available to users and allows businesses to deliver consistent skill development across distributed workforces. Users can access our platform to learn anytime and anywhere. Pluralsight applications are delivered on demand and across a range of devices and operating systems, including iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. In addition, Pluralsight applications are available for TV applications, including Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku.
Growth Strategy
We are pursuing the following principal strategies to drive our growth:
Expand deployments within our customer base
We utilize a land-and-expand strategy within businesses, beginning with either individual users or departmental deployments. Our platform is used by individuals, software developer groups, IT departments, line of business users, and human resources. Historically we have expanded from small teams to departments to business-wide deployments of our platform. For example, our 25 largest customers as of December 31, 2019 expanded their annual spend by approximately 18 times the amount they spent in the year of their initial purchase. We intend to drive increased sales to existing customers by targeting new users, departments, and geographies within our customers.
Grow our business customer base
We have a large direct sales force to focus on business sales and have aligned our sales team’s compensation structure to fit this objective. We intend to pursue a greater proportion of large scale, recurring business transactions and to more effectively drive business customer engagement throughout the life of the relationship. As an example of our ability to increase customer engagement, as of December 31, 2019, the number of customers with annual billings greater than $500,000 and $1,000,000 had grown by 78% and 63%, respectively, when compared to December 31, 2018. We will continue to expand our platform capabilities to deliver additional value to our customers. Our sales force educates business customers on the strengths of our platform to help customers make informed decisions and create a customized and unified end-to-end learning experience for their businesses.
Geographic Expansion
We see a significant opportunity to expand our reach internationally. We have customers in over 180 countries around the world and are building out sales teams in Europe and the Asia Pacific region to further address these large markets impacted by rapidly changing technologies.
In 2018, we expanded our operations to Ireland to build our business and drive customer growth. As a result of these investments, our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 40% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. In 2019, we expanded our operations to Australia to build our business and drive customer growth in the Asia Pacific region. We intend to continue selectively expanding in key markets to grow our customer base and increase our revenue.
Strategic Acquisitions
Strategic acquisitions have enabled us to quickly scale our business, expand our course library, add features to our platform, and address new areas of technology in high demand by our customers. Over the past seven years, we made nine targeted strategic acquisitions, which allowed us to expand our course library, author base, platform capabilities and product offerings. For example, the acquisition of GitPrime in May 2019 gave us our software developer productivity analysis product known as Pluralsight Flow. The addition of Pluralsight Flow allows us to sell more products to our existing customers and attract new customers. With this addition, we can measure the application of knowledge in real time. We intend to expand the capabilities of Pluralsight Flow with Pluralsight Skills over time to provide more actionable insights to software developers and their leaders.
We have proven success with identifying core capabilities in the market, acquiring talent and technology, and integrating these assets into our platform for a unified user experience. We may continue selectively adding content and platform capabilities through acquisitions that enhance value to our customers.
Expand course library with new content areas and offer additional platform features
We plan to continue expanding our course library to address the most relevant topics for users. We anticipate continued strong growth in our technology skills platform as we build out content in new areas like cloud, data science, data engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and security.
We introduced and acquired several platform features that have been integrated into our cloud-based technology skills platform, including skill and role assessments and learning paths. We will continue adding more features to our platform over time which we believe will strengthen our position as the go-to platform for technology leaders to deliver on their innovation strategies. 
Technology and Content
Our cloud-hosted, multi-tenant application platform is designed for enterprise scalability to enable significant growth in our user base, support businesses with widely distributed locations, and provide high levels of system performance and 
availability. Our distributed and scalable technology architecture allows our global user base to access courses anytime they want from almost any device, maximizing utilization of our platform.
Iris
Pluralsight Skills is powered by Iris, our machine learning intelligence underlying our skill assessments algorithm, user gap analysis and personalized content recommendations that guide users on how to develop desired skills. With every assessment and course completed, Iris absorbs information about the state of technology skills across our overall user base, within a specific business customer’s users, and for each individual user, thereby allowing our platform to provide predictive, personalized skill development solutions and adapt to the needs of our customers. Iris creates a smarter, more personalized learning journey for our users.
Content Creation
Our course library was created primarily by our world-class community of authors and industry partners. By publishing courses on our platform, we provide authors with exposure to our broad user base, thereby enabling our authors to build their reputations and increase their name recognition as a trusted source in the market. In addition, we share our success with our authors, who receive revenue-share amounts based on the viewing of their content. This incentivizes authors to create new, up-to-date, high-quality content, which drives customer growth and user adoption, creating a virtuous cycle that promotes our continued growth.
We identify and select prospective authors based on their skills, experience, following in user communities, popularity, ability to effectively instruct, and commitment to advancing knowledge about their discipline.
We provide authors with a set of tools and skill development materials to instruct them on our course design methodology. They are assigned to one of our content leaders, or production editors, to help them select topics, create a framework for their courses, and support them through the course production and editing process. External peer reviewers, who are generally authors, help ensure technical accuracy. Authors produce courses and presentations from their own location on their own time, making the process scalable and efficient.
Based on the size of our author community and the related depth and breadth of technical knowledge, we have the ability to consistently deliver current and relevant content to keep pace with technology’s fast pace of change. For example, in 2019, our authors published courses on average within 60 days of being engaged to create the course.
Pluralsight Flow
Our proprietary Flow software utilizes data-driven methods to process, analyze and visualize software developer coding activities into actionable metrics. We have created a number of metrics designed to measure the volume, type, and complexity of each code commit. Our solution is designed to work with a variety of commonly-used software coding and IT ticketing environments.
Technology and Content Team
Our technology and content teams use a human-centered design and development approach to engage with customers, users, and industry analysts through interviews and surveys on a frequent basis to understand customer needs and general industry trends to enhance our platform and course library. This allows us to build a platform that is uniquely positioned to deliver a highly personalized journey that focuses on the user and provides deep business analytics. The primary function of our technology team is to evaluate new technologies, determine the best technologies to create for our platform, incorporate new features and functionality into our platform to improve user experience, and ensure our solutions are delivered seamlessly, as well as to ensure that our platform is resilient and available to our customers at any time. Our content team tracks subject-matter experts across a variety of categories, researches the latest technology trends and adoption within businesses, and works with our authors to create high-quality content which addresses the needs of our customers.
As of December 31, 2019, we had over 520 employees in our technology and content organization. We intend to continue investing in our technology and content organization to strengthen our existing platform and add new capabilities to enhance our value to customers.
Seasonality
Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate due to various factors affecting our performance. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year 
and usually during the last month within each quarter. The increase in customer agreements entered into in the fourth quarter is generally attributable to large enterprise buying patterns typical in the software industry. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized 28% of our revenue, and recorded 34% of our total billings. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into in the fourth quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our billings, and to a lesser extent, our revenue. We generally recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. Therefore, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not impact changes to our reported revenue until future periods.
Customers
As of December 31, 2019, we had 17,942 business customers on our platform. This is an increase of over 1,100 business customers from December 31, 2018. We experienced rapid growth within large businesses. Our client base is diversified across industries, such as financial services, internet, technology, healthcare, media and entertainment, consumer goods and retail, transportation and logistics, government contractors, manufacturing, energy, education, and professional services.
Sales and Marketing
Our platform is designed to be easy to access and use, which allows both individual and business customers to seamlessly purchase subscriptions to, and deploy, our platform. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 24% of our revenue was derived from self-service subscriptions to our platform without any direct interaction with our sales team. Our self-service deployments are typically to small business teams and individual customers, which represent the “top of the funnel” for larger deployments, bringing our technology into the workplace and proliferating usage within a business.
We also deploy a direct sales team focused on landing new business customers, renewing existing subscriptions, and expanding business-wide deployments, as well as a field sales team responsible for sourcing new prospects and upsell opportunities. We expect to increase penetration of our business customers by expanding their use of our platform to address additional use cases and increasing the number of their employees who utilize our platform.
Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our cloud-based technology skills platform, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of loyal customers and authors. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, blogs, corporate communications, white papers, case studies, user events including Pluralsight LIVE in the United States and Europe, and webinars.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had over 1,600 full-time employees. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Competition
The market for professional skill development is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented. We expect competition to continue to accelerate in the future as competitors bundle new and more competitive offerings with their existing products and services, and as products and product enhancements are introduced into our market.
We compete directly or indirectly with:

• | instructor-led training vendors, such as Global Knowledge, General Assembly, and New Horizons;


• | legacy e-learning services, such as Skillsoft and Cornerstone OnDemand;


• | individual-focused e-learning services, such as LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, and Udacity;


• | software development productivity tools, such as Code Climate, Waydev, and BlueOptima; and


• | free solutions, such as YouTube.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | breadth, depth, and quality of content library;


• | platform features and functionality;


• | reliability and scalability;


• | performance;


• | user experience;


• | brand;


• | security and privacy;


• | price;


• | accessibility across several devices, operating systems, and applications;


• | third-party and customer integration;


• | effectiveness and quality of support and professional services;


• | customer, technology, and platform support; and


• | continued innovation.

We believe we compete favorably across these factors and are largely uninhibited by legacy constraints. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. Moreover, because our market is changing rapidly, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid technology and content development cycles, or lower marketing costs, could introduce new products and services that disrupt our market and better address the needs of our customers and potential customers.
Intellectual Property
We rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We believe our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business.
As of December 31, 2019, we had eight pending patent applications in the United States and abroad. These patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it beneficial. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.
Our Organizational Structure
In May 2018, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO. Our IPO was conducted through what is commonly referred to as an “UP-C” structure. In connection with the IPO and the UP-C structure, we completed the following transactions, referred to as the Reorganization Transactions:

• | The Fourth LLC Agreement of Pluralsight Holdings was amended and restated to, among other things: (i) appoint Pluralsight, Inc. as its sole managing member and (ii) effectuate the conversion of all outstanding redeemable convertible preferred limited liability company units, incentive units, and Class B incentive units into a single class of LLC Units.


• | Certain members of Pluralsight Holdings that were corporations merged with and into Pluralsight, Inc. and certain members of Pluralsight Holdings contributed certain of their LLC Units to Pluralsight, Inc., in each case in exchange for shares of Class A common stock.


• | The certificate of incorporation of Pluralsight, Inc. was amended and restated to authorize three classes of common stock, Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock, and one class of preferred stock. Class B and Class C common stock were issued on a one-for-one basis to the members of Pluralsight Holdings who retained LLC Units, or the Continuing Members. Class B and Class C common stock have voting rights but no economic rights.

As the sole managing member of Pluralsight Holdings, Pluralsight, Inc. has the sole voting interest in Pluralsight Holdings and controls all of the business operations, affairs, and management of Pluralsight Holdings. Accordingly, Pluralsight, Inc. consolidates the financial results of Pluralsight Holdings and reports the non-controlling interests of the Continuing Members’ LLC Units on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Reorganization Transactions completed as part of the IPO.
