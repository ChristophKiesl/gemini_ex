The intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its market position or expand its business.
 
Many of the Company’s current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition, which the Company does not have.

The Aiki mobile app product was launched on the Apple App Store the 1st week of August 2021. The new AI-based intuitive mental health ChatBot was announced in a press release on August 12th. It was also available to Android users as of September. Aiki is an interactive assistant that makes it easy to measure, understand, and improve the mental health of employees. The product aims to capitalize on the trend towards artificial intelligence platforms utilized by employers to raise awareness of employees’ mental health.

Another study charted a 50% rise in depression and a 60% drop in focus among all ages in the workplace at the start of the year. Mental health at work was called one of the most far-reaching workplace issues of 2019 - well before COVID, which creates a tremendous opportunity for Aiki.
