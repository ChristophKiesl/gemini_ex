Item 1. Business.
Company Background.
 
Clancy Corp. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 22, 2016.
 
Effective June 28, 2019 (Effective Date), a change of control occurred with respect to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of Stock Purchase Agreement, Gaoyang Liu purchased 2,000,000 shares of Company issued and outstanding common stock from Iryna Kologrim, the then sole officer, director, and majority shareholder of the Company. The 2,000,000 shares represented 64.4% of the shares of outstanding common stock of the Company. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Liu became the sole officer and director of the Company and Ms. Kologrim resigned in all capacities with respect to the Company. In addition, as of the Effective Date, the Company assigned all of the assets to Ms. Kologrim and she waived all liabilities, including any outstanding loans, and claims against the Company. In connection with the above change of control, the Company ceased its business operation and became a shell company as defined under Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act). Prior to such time, the Company produced and sold organic soaps.
 
On January 15, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State (the Amendment) which effectuated the following corporate actions:
 

● | the forward split of our issued and outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value, on thirty (30) post-split shares for a one (1) pre-split share basis applicable to shareholders of record as of January 2, 2020, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The increase of our authorized shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, from 75,000,000 to 345,000,000.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above corporate actions were adopted by written consent of our sole Director, Mr. Gaoyang Liu, on January 2, 2020, and the sole Director recommended the Corporate Actions be presented to our shareholders for approval. On January 3, 2020, Mr. Liu, our majority stockholder, holding 64.4% of our outstanding voting securities executed written consent approving the Corporate Actions. For purposes of the forward stock split described above, the sole Director also set January 2, 2020 as the record date of such action.
 
On March 31, 2020, a change of control occurred with respect to the Company. Pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into by and among the Clancy Corp. (Company), Gaoyang Liu (Seller), and Xiangying Meng (Buyer) (the Purchase Agreement), Seller assigned, transferred and conveyed to Buyer 60,000,000 shares of common stock of Company (Common Stock), which represents 64.4% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for the sum of $285,000. In addition, Seller assigned his rights and interest to outstanding loans made by Seller to the Company in the amount of $55,609 for the face value of such loans. Mr. Meng now owns 67,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company or 72.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Liu, the then sole officer and director of the Company resigned in all officer and director capacities from the Company and Mr. Meng was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In addition, Mr. Meng was appointed the sole director of the Company.

On April 13, 2020, Clancy Corp. (Company) received notification from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System that it had approved the Companys establishment of Shanghai Clancy Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (Shanghai Clancy) as a wholly owned foreign entity in Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China (WOFE). The initial application was filed by the Company with the PRC governmental agency on November 2, 2019. Shanghai Clancy registered a wholly-owned subsidiary in Beijing on April 24, 2020. Its name is Beijing Clancy Information Technology Co., Ltd. The main business scope is technology development, transfer, consultation, service and promotion. 
 
On July 6, 2020, the Nevada Secretary of State approved the Companys Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation which effectuated the following corporate action (Corporate Action):
 

● | the reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value, on thirty (30) pre-split shares to one (1) post-split share basis. Fractional shares resulting from the action will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above corporate action was adopted by written consent of our sole Director on June 11, 2020, and the sole Director recommended the corporate action be presented to our shareholders for approval. For purposes of the reverse stock split described above, the sole Director also set June 12, 2020 as the record date of such action. On June 12, 2020, our majority stockholder, holding 91.885% of our outstanding voting securities, executed written consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting approving the corporate action.
 
On December 23, 2020, the Company closed a private placement of its common stock to five parties pursuant to which five parties subscribed to 150,000,000 shares of common stock for the sum of $300,000. Of the total offering, Mr. Xiangying Meng, our sole officer and director, subscribed to 75,550,000 shares and paid the Company the sum of $151,100.
 
Proposed Combinations
 
Presently, under SEC Rule 405 promulgated under the Act, the Company qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets and no or nominal operations.  Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination or until it has successfully developed an operating business. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
The Companys principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business or through the successful development of its business described below.
 
As of the date of this report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company.  The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities.
 
Potential Acquisition Structure 
 
If we move forward with acquiring another business for which no assurances can be given, it will be impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Companys existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called tax free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e. 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Companys current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal shareholders. The Company does not intend to supply disclosure to shareholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction, unless required by applicable law or regulation.  The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K, as required, within four business days of a business combination which results in the Company ceasing to be a shell company. This Form 8-K will include complete disclosure of the target company, including audited financial statements.

It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available, from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Companys securities may have a depressive effect upon such market.
 
The present majority stockholder of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Registrant following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Registrants sole director may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed by our majority stockholder.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management with the consent of our majority stockholder. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure such goods and services. 
 
The Company intends to search for a target for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys. The approximate number of persons or entities that will be contacted is unknown and dependent on whether any opportunities are presented by the sources that we contact.  It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Registrant of the related costs incurred.
 
Our sole officer and director is engaged in outside business activities.  Our sole officer and director anticipates that he will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty.  In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties as officer and director of the Company. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
