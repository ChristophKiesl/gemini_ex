 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
 Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms “Beacon,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” are referring to Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.
 Overview
 Beacon is the largest publicly traded distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United States and Canada. We also distribute complementary building products, including siding, windows, specialty exterior building products, insulation, and waterproofing systems for residential and non-residential building exteriors. We purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors, and to a lesser extent, general contractors, home builders, retailers, and building materials suppliers.
 As of September 30, 2017, we operated 383 branches in 48 states throughout the United States and 6 provinces in Canada. We stock one of the most extensive assortments of high quality branded products in the industry, with over 50,000 SKUs available across our branch network, enabling us to deliver products to serve over 70,000  customers on a timely basis.
 On October 1, 2015, we acquired Roofing Supply Group, LLC (“RSG”), a leading roofing products distributor headquartered in Dallas, Texas, for approximately $1.17 billion. RSG operated 85 locations across 25 states, including the key markets of California, Florida, Texas, as well as the Pacific Northwest.
 On August 24, 2017 the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire, for approximately $2.625 billion, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Allied Building Products Corp. and an affiliated entity (together with its and their respective subsidiaries, “Allied”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Allied Acquisition”). Allied is one of the country’s largest exterior and interior building products distributors and is headquartered in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Allied distributes products across 208 locations in 31 states and has a strong presence in New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, Hawaii and the upper Midwest. The Allied Acquisition is expected to close on January 2, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 (“fiscal year 2017” or “2017”), residential roofing products comprised 54.4% of our sales, non-residential roofing products accounted for 29.1% of our sales, and complementary products provided the remaining 16.5% of our sales. Approximately  96% of our net sales were to customers located in the United States.
 We provide our customers with a comprehensive array of value-added benefits. These services and tools are focused on supporting the entire lifecycle of our contactor’s business, with particular focus on enhancing their ability to meet and exceed the needs of their customers (see “Our Products and Services” for a full listing). We believe the additional services we provide strengthen our relationships with our customers and distinguish us from our competition, as the vast majority of orders require at least some of these services. Our ability to provide these services efficiently and reliably can save contractors time and money while also enabling us to achieve attractive gross profit margins on our product sales. We have earned a reputation for providing a high level of product availability and high-quality service from our experienced employees who provide timely, accurate and safe delivery of products.
 Our customer base includes a diverse population of residential and non-residential roofing contractors from the markets in which we operate. Along with new construction projects, these local roofing contractors are typically involved in the replacement, or re-roofing, component of the roofing industry. We utilize a branch-based operating model that allows branches to maintain local customer relationships and benefit from our centralized infrastructure. This operating model allows us to benefit from the resources and scale efficiencies of being a national distributor while still providing customers with specialized products and personalized local services tailored to their specific geographic region.

We have achieved our growth through a combination of 43 strategic and complementary acquisitions since our initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2004, opening new branch locations and broadening our product offerings. In fiscal year 2017, we acquired 23 branches and opened 4 new branches. We have grown from $652.9 million in net sales in fiscal year 2004 to $4.38 billion in net sales in fiscal year 2017, which represents a thirteen-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 15.8% . Our organic growth, which includes growth from existing and newly opened branches but excludes growth from acquired branches, averaged a CAGR of 5.1% per annum over the same period. Acquired branches are excluded from organic growth measures until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the reporting period. Since our IPO, we have opened 78 new branch locations, and during this same period existing market sales excluding greenfields increased at an average of 2.3% per annum. Existing market sales excluding greenfields are defined as the aggregate sales from branches open for the entire comparable annual periods. Income from operations has increased from $34.7 million in fiscal year 2004 to $216.1 million in fiscal year 2017, which represents a thirteen-year CAGR of 15.1%. We believe that our proven business model can continue to deliver industry-leading growth and operating profit margins.
 Our Industry
     Based on management’s estimates, we believe that the roofing distribution market in the United States and Canada represents approximately $26 billion in revenue with roughly 60-65% of the market in residential roofing and 35-40% in commercial. We also participate in several other areas of the building products market within our complementary product line, including siding, windows, insulation and waterproofing, among others.
 We believe the majority of roofing demand is driven by re-roofing activity (estimated at 80-90%), with the remaining balance being tied to new construction. Re-roofing projects are considered to be necessary maintenance and repair expenditures, and are therefore less likely to be postponed during periods of recession or slower economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products historically has been less volatile than overall demand for construction products.
 Net sales from re-roofing are also expected to increase as the median age of owner occupied housing has increased from 31 years to 37 years over the last decade, according to U.S. Census data. As homes age, re-roofing demand increases, and home-owners are forced to replace or repair old, deteriorating roofs. During the past decade, re-roofing demand also has been influenced in part by existing home sales trends. Lower housing turnover during the 2007-2015 years, in particular, has resulted in many homeowners’ deferral of necessary re-roofing decisions. This combination of aging U.S. housing inventory, more favorable trends in existing home sales, and deferred re-roofing amid the housing downturn supports a favorable supply/demand dynamic in the residential repair and remodel market in the coming years.
 Regional variations in economic activity influence the level of demand for roofing products across the United States. Of particular importance are regional differences in the level of new home construction and renovation. Demographic trends, including population growth and migration, contribute to the regional variations through their influence on regional housing starts and existing home sales.
 In addition to our domestic operations, we also operate in 6 provinces across Canada. These international locations represented approximately 4% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. We expect overall demand for operations in Canada to grow at rate similar to our United States operations.
 Roofing Distributors
 Wholesale distribution is the primary distribution channel for both residential and commercial roofing products. Wholesale roofing product distributors serve the important role of facilitating the purchasing relationships between roofing materials manufacturers and thousands of contractors. Wholesale distributors can maintain localized inventories, extend trade credit, give product advice and provide delivery and logistics services.
 Despite some recent consolidation, the roofing materials distribution industry remains highly fragmented. The industry is characterized by several “national” distributors and a large number of local and regional participants. The vast majority of our competition continues to comes from these smaller, localized roofing supply distributors, and, to a much lesser extent, other building supply distributors and ‘‘big box’’ retailers.

Residential Roofing
   Re-roofing is largely a non-discretionary decision for homeowners. However, prevailing housing market conditions and severe storm activity can influence the precise timing involved. Specifically, we believe housing turnover can impact certain homeowners’ re-roofing decisions. Increases in single-family existing home sales during fiscal 2015-2017, coupled with more active storm related roofing demand in 2016 and 2017, have boosted industry re-roofing activity during recent years. This contrasts with the period of stagnant re-roofing demand that was experienced from 2007-2014 during the housing downturn and early into its recovery. 
 Within the new construction portion of the residential roofing market, growth historically has been driven by housing starts, and in particular, by single-family home construction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single-family starts peaked at 1.7 million homes in 2005 and troughed at 0.4 million homes in 2011. Housing starts have recovered steadily since 2011 and have reached 0.8 million in 2016. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) economic forecast projects single-family starts will finish 2017 with a 7% gain compared to 2016 and see 8%-9% increases in both 2018 and 2019. 
   Non-residential Roofing
     As with residential re-roofing, non-residential re-roofing activity tends to be less cyclical than new construction and depends, in part, upon the types of materials on existing roofs, their expected lifespan and intervening factors such as wind or water damage. In contrast to residential roofing, we do not believe economic driven re-roofing project deferrals have been as common for the non-residential product line. The non-residential roofing market primarily consists of office, retail, industrial and institutional buildings.
 According to the 2018 Dodge Construction Outlook, U.S. construction starts will increase 3% in 2018 following expected gains of 4% in 2017 and 5% in 2016. Commercial buildings are expected to see a 2% increase, while institutional buildings should see a 3% increase in construction during 2018.
 Complementary Building Products
 Demand for complementary building products such as siding, windows and doors, and insulation for both the residential and non-residential markets has been at historically low levels in recent years, consistent with the downturns in the new construction markets and in the overall economy. Unlike the roofing industry, demand for these products is more discretionary and significantly influenced by new construction markets and the pace of overall residential remodeling activity. 
 According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, its Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) is calling for accelerating growth rates in U.S. remodeling activity throughout calendar year 2018 with anticipated growth rate of 7.7% by the third quarter. As mentioned above, the outlook for new home construction is also projected to see solid growth in the coming years.
 Our Strengths
 We believe the sales and earnings growth we have achieved over time has been, and will continue to be, driven by our primary competitive strengths, which include the following:

• | Leading roofing distribution platform with a national scope combined with regional expertise. We are the largest publicly traded distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United States, and we maintain leading positions in key metropolitan markets across the United States and Canada. Our geographic footprint is designed to provide advantages in the regional markets we serve. We utilize a branch-based operating model whereby branches cultivate and maintain local customer relationships while benefiting from centralized functions such as information technology, marketing, accounting, financial reporting, credit, purchasing, human resources, legal and tax services. We provide our customers with specialized products and personalized local services tailored to their specific geographic region, with the resources and scale efficiencies of a national distributor.

• | Diversified business model in a stable environment. Our business historically has been protected in times of economic downturn because of the non-discretionary nature of most re-roofing demand, the mix of our sales between residential and non-residential products, our geographic and customer diversity, and the financial and operational ability to expand our business and obtain market share. We have a long history of organic sales growth and healthy gross margins through a variety of economic cycles. Over the last thirteen fiscal years, our total and existing market net sales have increased by a CAGR of 15.8% and 5.1%, respectively, (including growth through acquisitions) and our gross margins in existing markets (i.e., excluding acquisitions) have averaged approximately 24%. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-positioned in attractive roofing demand markets. We believe that our national distribution platform is strategically positioned to continue benefitting from the North American market recovery, and we expect that improving economic conditions and continued recovery in residential and non-residential construction activity will drive the demand for additional roofing materials and complementary building products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Superior customer service to our well established, long-term customer base. Our diverse customer base consists of contractors, home builders, building owners, and other resellers. A significant number of our customers have relied on us as their vendor of choice for decades, and we believe that these strong customer relationships cannot be easily replicated. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our net sales.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the services provided by our employees improve our customers’ efficiency and profitability, which, in turn, strengthens our customer relationships. We consider customer relations and our employees’ knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials as being vital to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer satisfaction. We invest significant resources in professional development, management skills, product knowledge and operational proficiency. The in-depth knowledge of the materials we sell and their applications allows our sales personnel to provide technical advice and value-added service to our customers throughout the construction process.
 We provide a number of value-added services to our customers. In particular, we support our customers with: advice and assistance on product identification, specification and technical support; timely job site delivery, rooftop loading and logistical services; tapered insulation design and related layout services; metal fabrication and related metal roofing design and layout services; trade credit; and marketing support, including project leads for contractors.
  
• | Strong platform for growth and acquisition. From the time of our IPO in 2004, we increased net sales at rates well above the overall growth in the roofing materials distribution industry. We have expanded our business through strategic acquisitions, new branch openings, and the diversification of our product offering. We generally have improved the financial and operating performance of our acquired companies and helped them to grow their businesses following acquisition.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong cash flow generation driven by a stable business model. We have increased net sales in eight of the last ten fiscal years, including increases in each of the last seven consecutively. Our track record of growth, combined with limited capital expenditure requirements, has resulted in strong free cash flow across all economic cycles. We have a strong history of managing our debt leverage effectively and we have successfully reduced leverage subsequent to the RSG transaction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Centralized IT platform. We have made a significant investment in our information systems, including the ongoing development of a platform for online sales. All of our locations, except for one fabrication facility, operate on the same management information systems, providing us with a consistent platform to deliver excellent customer service and achieve operating efficiencies in purchasing, pricing and inventory management. Our systems have substantial capacity to handle our future growth plans without requiring significant additional investment. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industry-leading management team with a track record of integration. We believe that our key employees, including branch managers, regional vice presidents and executive officers, are among the

most experienced members of the roofing industry and have a track record of achieving strong revenue growth and delivering profitability. Since Beacon became a publicly traded company in 2004, the Beacon management team has successfully completed and integrated 43 acquisitions and opened 78 new greenfield locations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategies
 Our objective is to be the preferred supplier of roofing and other complementary building product materials across markets in the United States and Canada while continuing to increase net sales and maximize our profitability. We plan to attain these goals by executing the following strategies:

• | Expand product offering and increase cross-selling activities. Due to the unique characteristics of each geographic region, our local customers typically require market specific product offerings. We believe we have one of the most extensive offerings of high-quality branded products in the industry, with over 50,000 SKUs available across our branch network, however there remain opportunities for branches to expand their current product rosters. This will create additional opportunities for our branches to cross-sell more products throughout our existing network. In particular, we seek to expand non-residential roofing sales into markets where we currently sell mostly residential roofing. In addition, we work closely with customers and suppliers to identify new products and services, and continue to expand our product offering to include complementary building materials such as windows, siding, doors, waterproofing systems, insulation and metal fabrication.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to provide exceptional customer service and roofing expertise. We provide a comprehensive array of high-quality products and offer value-added services. In fiscal year 2017, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 97% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches. We believe that our focus on providing both value-added services and accurate and rapid order fulfillment enables us to attract and retain customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively pursue opportunities for organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions and greenfield expansion is an important component of our growth strategy. We believe that there will be meaningful opportunities to further expand or intensify our geographic focus in contiguous or existing regions. We intend to continue to pursue our growth strategy while focusing on maintaining a strong balance sheet.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since 2004, Beacon has opened 78 new branches through greenfield expansion. Beacon has a disciplined approach to new branch openings and its typical strategy is to open branches: (1) within its existing markets; (2) where existing customers have expanded into new markets; or (3) in areas that have limited or no acquisition candidates and are a good fit with its business model and culture.
 Since 2004, Beacon has completed 43 acquisitions. We believe that the roofing distribution sector remains fragmented and that there are significant opportunities to further grow our business through disciplined, strategic acquisitions. With only a few large, well-capitalized competitors in the industry, we believe we can continue to build on our distribution platform by successfully acquiring additional roofing materials distributors. Our main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we do not service or that complement our existing operations in an area.
  
• | Enhance margins and free cash flow generation through continued execution of our growth strategy. We believe that as recent greenfield locations continue to ramp up, and if expected synergies and cost savings from acquisitions are realized, our margins will continue to improve. We also believe that we have an operating model that requires minimal capital, which, when combined with stable re-roofing demand, will position us for strong free cash flow generation. We intend to continue to use cash flows to support deleveraging and our continued platform growth. We have, and will continue to, invest heavily in our branch expansion. Although management estimates that our branch expansion strategy over the past several years has resulted in above average upfront operating costs and capital expenditures, we believe these new branches will increase their contribution to our profitability and cash flow as they mature.

Our Customers
 We serve over 70,000 customers, comprised of contractors, home builders, building owners, and other resellers across the continental United States and Canada. Our typical customer base varies by end market, with relatively small contractors in the residential market and small to large-sized contractors in the non-residential market. To a lesser extent, our customer base in a market can include general contractors, retailers and building materials suppliers. A significant number of our customers have relied on us or our predecessors as their vendor of choice for decades, therefore we believe that we have strong customer relationships that our competitors cannot easily displace or replicate. No single customer accounts for more than 2% of our net sales.
Our Culture and Employees
 We believe that our values based culture is a key differentiator, which is critical to our success. We pride ourselves on attracting and retaining highly dedicated and customer focused employees at all levels of the organization. We maintain a safety-first environment and strong relations with our employees.
 As of September 30, 2017 we had 5,406 employees consisting of 1,334 in sales and marketing, 682 branch and assistant branch managers, 2,666 drivers, delivery helpers and warehouse workers, 680 general and administrative employees and 44 executives. We have 33 employees that are represented by labor unions and there are no outstanding labor disputes.
 Sales and Marketing
 Sales strategy
 Our sales strategy is to provide a comprehensive array of high-quality products and superior value-added services to residential and non-residential roofing contractors reliably, accurately and on time. In fiscal year 2017, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 97% of warehouse orders at the time of invoice. This is a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches. We believe that our focus on providing superior value-added services and accurate and rapid order fulfillment enables us to attract and retain customers.
 11


Sales organization
 We have attracted and retained an experienced sales force that consisted of approximately 1,181 employees as of September 30, 2017 who are responsible for generating sales at the local branch level. The expertise of our salespeople helps us to increase sales to existing customers and add new customers.
 Each of our branches is led by a branch manager, who also functions as the branch’s sales manager. In addition, each branch generally employs one to four outside salespeople and one to five inside salespeople who report to their branch manager. Branches that focus primarily on the residential market typically staff a larger number of outside salespeople.
 The primary objectives of our outside salespeople are to increase sales to existing customers and prospect for new customers. These activities are supported by utilizing our CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system throughout our selling organization. We continue to use our proprietary LogicTrack software system to extract information on construction projects in our local markets. Once a construction project is identified, members of our design and estimating team create job quotes, which, along with pertinent bid and job information, are readily available to our salespeople through LogicTrack. Our outside salespeople then contact potential customers in an effort to solicit their interest in participating with us in the identified project. Throughout this process, LogicTrack maintains a record of quoting activity, due dates, and other data to allow tracking of the projects and efficient follow-up. By seeking a contractor to “partner with” on a bid, we increase the likelihood that such contractor will purchase their roofing materials and related products from us in the event that the contractor is selected for the project.
 To complement our outside sales force, we have built an experienced and technically proficient inside sales staff that provides vital product expertise to our customers. Our inside sales force is responsible for fielding incoming orders, providing pricing quotations and responding to customer inquiries.
 In addition to our outside and inside sales forces, we employ representatives who act as liaisons for certain roofing materials manufacturers to assist with the promotion of specific products to professional contractors, architects and building owners. These relationships include exclusive geographic territories and we currently have a developed relationship with Carlisle on this basis.
 Marketing
 In order to capitalize on established customer relationships and locally developed brands, we have maintained the trade names of most of the businesses that we have acquired. These trade names—such as Acme Building Materials, Alabama Roofing Supply, American Building & Roofing, Atlantic Building Products, Applicators Sales, Beacon Roofing Supply Canada Company, Beacon Sales, Best Distributing, BJ Supply, Cassady Pierce, Coastal Metal Service, Dealers Choice, Eco Insulation Supply, Enercon Products, Entrepot de la Toiture, Ford Wholesale, Fox Brothers Company, Groupe Bédard, Intermountain Supply, JGA, JGA Beacon, Lowry’s, Lyf-Tym Building Products, Lafayette Wood Works, McClure Johnston, Mississippi Roofing Supply, North Coast Roofing Systems, Pacific Supply, Posi-Pentes, Posi-Slope, ProCoat Systems, Quality Roofing Supply, RCI Roofing Supply, RIS Insulation Supply, RIS Roofing Supply, RIS Roofing and Insulation Supply, Roof Depot, Roofing Supply Group, Southern Roof Center, Statewide Wholesale, Structural Materials, The Roof Center, West End Roofing, Siding & Windows, Wholesale Roofing Supply, and Woodfeathers — are well-known in the local markets in which the respective branches compete and are associated with high-quality products and customer service.
 As a supplement to the efforts of our sales force, each of our branches communicates with residential and non-residential contractors in their local markets through newsletters, direct mail, social media and the Internet. In order to build and strengthen relationships with customers and vendors, we offer exclusive promotions and sponsor our own regional trade shows, which feature general business and roofing seminars for our customers and product demonstrations by our vendors. In addition, we attend numerous industry trade shows throughout the regions in which we compete, and we are an active member of the National Roofing Contractors Association, as well as certain regional contractors’ associations.
 In fiscal year 2017, we introduced Beacon Pro+, our innovative e-commerce portal that enables customers to order online from our catalog of over 50,000 products and have 24/7 access to view real time pricing, review the status of orders, request and approve quotes, and pay their bills online.
 12


Purchasing and Suppliers
 Our status as a leader in our core geographic markets, as well as our reputation in the industry, has allowed us to forge strong relationships with numerous manufacturers of roofing materials and related products, including Atlas Roofing, Berger Building Products, Building Products of Canada, Carlisle Syntec, CertainTeed Roofing, CertainTeed Siding, Firestone Building Products, GAF, IKO Manufacturing, James Hardie Building Products, Johns Manville Roofing, Malarkey, Owens Corning Roofing, Ply Gem, Soprema, and TAMKO Building Products.
 We are viewed by our suppliers as a key distributor due to our industry expertise, past growth and profitability, significant market share, financial strength, and the substantial volume of products that we distribute.
 We manage the procurement of products through our national headquarters and regional offices, allowing us to take advantage of both our scale and local market conditions. We believe this enables us to purchase products more economically than most of our competitors. Product is shipped directly by the manufacturers to our branches or customers.
 Operations and Infrastructure
 Operations
 Our branch-based model provides each location with a significant amount of autonomy to operate within the parameters of our overall business model. Operations at each branch are tailored to meet local customer needs. Branch managers are responsible for sales, pricing and staffing activities, and have full operational control of customer service and deliveries. We provide our branch managers with significant incentives that allow them to share in the profitability of their respective branches as well as in the company as a whole. Employees at our regional and corporate operations assist the branches with, among other things, procurement, credit and safety services, fleet management, information systems support, contract management, accounting, treasury and legal services, human resources, benefits administration and sales and use tax services.
 Our distribution fulfillment process is initiated upon receiving a request for a contract job order or direct product order from a contractor. Under a contract job order, a contractor typically requests roofing or other construction materials and technical support services. The contractor discusses the project’s requirements with a salesperson and the salesperson provides a price quotation for the package of products and services. Subsequently, the salesperson processes the order and we deliver the products to the customer’s job site. In fiscal year 2017, we were able to support our customers by fulfilling approximately 97% of warehouse orders through our in-stock inventory as a result of the breadth and depth of the inventory maintained at our local branches.
 Facilities
 As of September 30, 2017, our network of 383 branches was serving metropolitan areas in 48 states and 6 Canadian provinces. This network has enabled us to effectively and efficiently serve a broad customer base and to achieve a leading market position in each of our core geographic markets.
Fleet
 For the year ended September 30, 2017, our distribution infrastructure supported over one million deliveries. To service our customer base, we maintained a dedicated owned fleet of 590 straight trucks, 566 tractors and 978 trailers as of September 30, 2017. Nearly all of our delivery vehicles are equipped with specialized equipment, including 1,779 truck-mounted forklifts, cranes, hydraulic booms and conveyors, which are necessary to deliver products to rooftop job sites in an efficient and safe manner and in accordance with our customers’ requirements.
 Our branches typically focus on providing materials to customers who are located within a two-hour radius of their respective facilities. Our branches generally make deliveries each business day.
 Management Information Systems
 We have fully integrated management information systems across our locations. Acquired businesses are moved to our IT platform as soon as feasible following acquisition. Our systems support every major internal

operational function, except payroll, providing complete integration of purchasing, receiving, order processing, shipping, inventory management, sales analysis and accounting. The same databases are shared within the systems, allowing our branches to easily acquire products from other branches or schedule deliveries by other branches, greatly enhancing our customer service. Our systems also include a pricing matrix which allows us to refine pricing by region, branch, customer and customer type, or even a specific customer project. In addition, our systems allow us to centrally monitor all branch and regional performance as often as daily. We have centralized many functions to leverage our growing size, including accounts payable, insurance, payroll, employee benefits, vendor relations, and banking.
 All of our branches are connected to a common computer network via secure Internet connections or private data lines. We maintain redundant systems with transactional data getting replicated throughout each business day. We have the capability of electronically switching our operations to the disaster recovery system.
 We place purchase orders electronically with some of our major vendors. The vendors then transmit their invoices electronically to us. Our system matches these invoices with the related purchase orders and then schedules the associated payment. We retain many financial, credit and other documents for purposes of internal approvals, online viewing and auditing.
 Government Regulations
 We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local agencies. These agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable statutes and regulations affecting environmental issues and our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices.
 In 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the majority of the provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”). The Act places requirements on employers to provide a minimum level of benefits to employees and assesses penalties on employers if the benefits do not meet the required minimum level or if the cost of coverage to employees exceeds affordability thresholds specified in the Act. The minimum benefits and affordability requirements took effect in 2014. The Act also imposes an excise tax beginning in 2018 on plans whose average cost exceeds specified amounts. We have analyzed the effects on us from the provisions of the Act and we do not currently anticipate a significant financial impact.
 Competition
 Although we are one of the two largest roofing materials distributors in the United States and Canada, the United States roofing supply industry is highly competitive. The vast majority of our competition comes from local and regional roofing supply distributors, and, to a lesser extent, other building supply distributors and “big box” retailers. Among distributors, we compete against a small number of large distributors and many small and local privately-owned distributors. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and availability of credit and capital. We generally compete on the basis of the quality of our services, product quality and, to a lesser extent, price.
Order Backlog
 Order backlog is not a material aspect of our business and no material portion of our business is subject to government contracts.
 Seasonality
 In general, sales and net income are highest during our first, third and fourth fiscal quarters, which represent the peak months of construction and re-roofing, especially in our branches in the northern and mid-western regions of the United States and in Canada. Our sales are substantially lower during the second quarter, when we usually incur net losses. These quarterly fluctuations have diminished as we have diversified further into the southern and western regions of the United States.

We generally experience our peak working capital needs during the third quarter after we build our inventories following the winter season but before we begin collecting on most of our spring receivables. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, so our borrowings tend to be highest in the third quarter of our fiscal year.
