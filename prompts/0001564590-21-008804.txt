ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Overview
 All references to “LSB Industries,” “LSB,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to LSB Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to LSB Industries, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.  Notes referenced throughout this document refer to consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures that are found in Item 8.
 The Company was formed in 1968 as an Oklahoma corporation and became a Delaware corporation in 1977. We manufacture and market chemical products for the agricultural, industrial and mining markets.  We own and operate facilities in El Dorado, Arkansas (the “El Dorado Facility”), Cherokee, Alabama (the “Cherokee Facility”), and Pryor, Oklahoma (the “Pryor Facility”), and we operate a facility on behalf of a global chemical company in Baytown, Texas (the “Baytown Facility”).  Our products are sold through distributors and directly to end customers throughout the United States and parts of Mexico and Canada.
 Our Business
 Our business manufactures products for three principal markets:
  
• | Agricultural Markets: ammonia, fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (“AN” and “HDAN”) and urea ammonia nitrate (“UAN”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industrial Markets: high purity and commercial grade ammonia, high purity AN, sulfuric acids, concentrated, blended and regular nitric acid, mixed nitrating acids, carbon dioxide, and diesel exhaust fluid (“DEF”); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mining Markets: industrial grade AN (“LDAN”) and AN solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 The products we manufacture at our facilities are primarily derived from natural gas (a raw material feedstock).  Our facilities and production processes have been designed to produce products that are marketable at nearly each stage of production.  This design has allowed us to develop and deploy a business model optimizing the mix of products to capture the value opportunities in the end markets we serve with a focus on balancing our production. 
 The chart below highlights representative products and applications in each of our end markets.
 
 
End Market | Products | Applications 
Agricultural | UAN, HDAN and ammonia | Fertilizer and fertilizer blends for corn and other crops; NPK fertilizer blends


Industrial | Nitric acid, metallurgical and commercial grade ammonia, sulfuric acid, diesel exhaust fluid and other urea solutions, Specialty E-2 ammonium nitrate and CO2 | Semi-conductor and polyurethane intermediates, ordnance; Pulp and paper, alum, water treatment, metals and vanadium processing; Power plant emissions abatement, water treatment, refrigerants, metals processing; Exhaust stream additive, horticulture / greenhouse applications; refrigeration
Mining | LDAN, AN solution and HDAN | Ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and specialty emulsions for mining applications, surface mining, quarries, and construction

 Our Strategy 
 We pursue a strategy of balancing the sale of product as fertilizer into the agriculture markets at spot prices or short duration pre-sales and developing industrial and mining customers that purchase substantial quantities of products, primarily under contractual obligations and/or pricing arrangements that generally provide for the pass through of some raw material and other manufacturing costs.  We believe this product and market diversification strategy allows us to have more consistent levels of production compared to some of our competitors and helps reduce the volatility risk inherent in the prices of our raw material feedstock and/or the changes in demand for our products. 
 The strategy of developing industrial and mining customers helps to moderate the risk inherent in the agricultural markets where spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not have a correlation to the natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for like and competing nitrogen sources.  This volatility of sales pricing in our agricultural products may, from time to time, compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the product.  Additionally, the lack of sufficient non-seasonal agricultural sales volume to operate our manufacturing facilities at optimum levels can preclude us from balancing production and storage capabilities. Looking forward, we remain focused on upgrading margins by maximizing downstream production.  Our strategy calls for further development of industrial customers who assume the volatility risk associated with the raw material costs and mitigate the effects of seasonality in the agricultural sector.
 Our strategy also includes evaluating acquisitions of strategic assets or companies, mergers with other companies and investment in additional production capacity where we believe those acquisitions, mergers or expansion of production capacity will enhance the value of the Company and provide appropriate returns.
 Key Operating Initiatives for 2021
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Operating Initiatives for 2021” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) contained in Item 7 of this report, we believe our future results of operations and financial condition will depend significantly on our ability to successfully implement the following key initiatives: 
  
• | Continue Focusing on Becoming a “Best in Class” Chemical Plant Operator with respect to Safe, Reliable Operations that Produce the Highest Quality Product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue Broadening the Distribution of our Products.
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Development of a Strategy to Capitalize on Ammonia Opportunities in a Renewable Energy Focused Economy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving Our Capital Structure and Overall Cost of Capital.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate Acquisition of Strategic Assets or Companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

COVID-19 Pandemic
 All of the facilities we operate have been designated as essential critical infrastructure based on guidelines issued by the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.  Since we produce fertilizer products used by the agriculture industry, as well as chemical products required in a variety of industrial manufacturing processes, LSB has been determined to be a critical service provider, and therefore, our facilities have remained operational despite the government mandated operational limitations or business closings resulting from the federal, state and local government responses to the evolving global health crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Management has taken significant measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees and our business continuity during this challenging situation.  For our personnel at our manufacturing facilities and retail agricultural centers, we have developed plans and procedures that have allowed them to operate in a safe manner in order to protect them, their families, our vendors and our customers.  These include daily health screenings, including temperature checks and questionnaires, use of proper personal protection equipment, regular disinfection and cleaning of equipment and workspaces, social distancing, working from home where appropriate and quarantining of employees according to specific protocols.  We intend to maintain our discipline in this regard for however long the current health risk persists.

The nitrogen chemical industry was under pressure during most of 2020.  As a result of the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant decline in energy prices, industry operating rates increased globally, resulting in greater supply and lower fertilizer pricing.  Pricing for all major agricultural product categories was impacted by the continued oversupply of ammonia in our primary end markets, along with increased imports of some of our downstream products.  Industrial and mining sales volume declined as a result of pandemic-related weakness in demand in several of our end markets.  
 Looking ahead to 2021, while much of the U.S. economy has a least partially reopened, uncertainty remains with respect to our various end markets.  On the agricultural side, the corn market has recently experienced some positive indicators as discussed below under “Agricultural Market Conditions.” However, improvements in fertilizer pricing could be tempered from higher natural gas costs and additional imported fertilizers. With respect to industrial and mining sales volume, we are seeing gradual improvement in demand for nitric acid, industrial ammonia and ammonium nitrate as sectors such as automotive manufacturing, home building, and copper mining have increased activity.  Also see discussion below under “Industrial and Mining Products” concerning a new long-term nitric acid supply contract with a customer. 
 On the liquidity front, as of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $58.1 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity, which, we believe, provides us with ample liquidity to fund our operations and meet our current obligations. Also see discussions under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of our MD&A.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Strategically Located Chemical Assets and Long-Standing Customer Relationships
 Our business benefits from highly advantageous locations with logistical and distribution benefits.  We have access to the Nustar ammonia pipeline from the U.S. Gulf at our El Dorado Facility, which provides low-cost transportation to distribution points.  The El Dorado Facility also has rail access providing favorable freight logistics to our industrial and agricultural customers and cost advantaged when selling a number of our products West of the Mississippi River.  Our Cherokee Facility is located east of the Mississippi River, allowing it to reach customers that are not freight logical for others.  Our Cherokee Facility sits adjacent to the Tennessee River, providing barge receipt and shipping access, in addition to truck and rail delivery access.  Our Pryor Facility is located in the heart of the Southern Plains with close proximity to the Port of Catoosa along with strategic rail and truck delivery access. 
Advantaged Raw Material Cost Position
 We produce ammonia at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities, which allows us to take advantage of the spread between producing and purchasing ammonia at those facilities.  
Diversified Sources of Revenue
 Our business serves a broad range of end markets, which we believe diminishes the cyclicality of our financial performance.  Our business serves the agricultural, industrial and mining markets.  The flexible nature of our production process and storage capability allows us the ability to shift our product mix based on end market demand. 
Operation of Multiple Facilities and High Production Capacity 
 We operate our business through several facilities.  Operating multiple facilities diversifies the risk and impact of operational issues that may occur at a single plant, which gives us a strategic advantage over competitors that operate their company through a single facility.  Additionally, our competitive production capacity of our combined plants allows us to decrease manufacturing costs, helping us to achieve enhanced margins.
Agricultural Market Conditions 
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of MD&A, the price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports.  Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors’ facilities and international and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics.  These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins.
Looking forward to 2021, favorable dynamics for U.S. agriculture have translated into higher prices to date for a variety of crops, including corn, which has prompted an increase in demand for fertilizers by farmers seeking to maximize yields in the coming spring planting season.  Favorable grower income in 2020, coupled with significant increase in Chinese imports of agricultural commodities, lower ending U.S. corn inventory levels, and drought conditions in South America have pushed commodity prices, including corn, to their highest level in over seven years.  According to certain industry sources, the estimated corn acres to be planted in 2021 is between 92 to 94 million.  These factors have resulted in a price rally for fertilizers over the last several months which we expect will continue through the spring planting season.   
 See discussion above concerning the COVID-19 pandemic under “Our Strategy.”

Agricultural Products 
 We produce and sell UAN, HDAN and ammonia, all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers.  We sell these agricultural products to farmers, ranchers, fertilizer dealers and distributors primarily in the ranch land and grain production markets in the U.S.  Our nitrogen-based fertilizers are used to grow food crops, biofuel feedstock crops, pasture land for grazing livestock and forage production.  We maintain long-term relationships with wholesale agricultural distributors and retailers and also sell directly to agricultural end-users through our network of wholesale and retail distribution centers. 
 The price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports.  Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors’ facilities combined with international and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics.  These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins. 
 During 2020, we completed a key storage project that will allow us to further maximize our production of HDAN at our El Dorado Facility, which we expect to enable us to achieve higher production, a lower cost per ton and increased sales of that product during periods of more attractive pricing.
 We develop our market position in these areas by emphasizing high quality products, customer service and technical advice.  
 In addition, we have an agreement with a third-party purchaser, Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC, (“CVR”), to market and sell a portion of our UAN.  Demand for sales under this agreement is based on the expected needs of the purchaser’s customers.  The agreement provides the exclusive right (but not the obligation) to purchase, at market prices, substantially all of the UAN produced at our Pryor Facility.  The term of the agreement runs through June 2021, with automatic one-year extensions, subject to a 180-day advance notice of termination from CVR or a 90-day advance notice from us.
 We sell most of our agricultural products at the current spot market price in effect at the time of shipment, although we periodically enter into forward sales commitments for some of these products.  
 Industrial and Mining Market Conditions
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of MD&A, in our industrial markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in general economic conditions, energy prices, metals market prices and our contractual arrangements with certain large customers.  In our mining markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in the overall North American consumption levels of mining products that can be impacted by weather. Additionally, changes in natural gas prices and demand in renewable power sources, such as wind and solar in the electrical generation sector, will impact demand for our mining products and impact competition within the other sectors of this market.  
 Looking forward to 2021, we are seeing gradual recovery in these end markets.  As COVID-19 vaccines are increasingly distributed, demand for our products from sectors like automotive manufacturing and power generation is expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels. We expect strong metals mining prices will drive strong demand for our mining products as producers push to extract as much as possible. As it relates to the coal mining, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) is projecting an increase in production driven by a forecasted increase in natural gas prices for electricity generators, making coal more competitive in the electric power sector.   
 See discussion above concerning the COVID-19 pandemic under “Our Strategy.” 
 Industrial and Mining Products
 We manufacture and sell industrial acids and other chemical products primarily to the polyurethane intermediates, paper, fibers, emission control, and electronics industries.  In addition, we produce and sell blended and regular nitric acid and industrial and high purity ammonia for many specialty applications, including the reduction of air emissions from power plants.
 Sales of our industrial and mining products are generally made to customers pursuant to sales contracts or pricing arrangements on terms that include the cost of the primary raw materials as a pass-through component in the sales price.  These contractual sales stabilize the effect of commodity cost changes and fluctuations in demand for these products due to the cyclicality of the end markets.
 During 2020, one of our subsidiaries, El Dorado Chemical Company (“EDC”) entered into a contract with a customer to supply nitric acid. Under the agreement, EDC will supply between 70,000 to 100,000 tons of nitric acid annually.  The initial contract term began in January 2021 and extends through 2027 but includes automatic one-year renewal terms.
 In addition, EDC and Koch Fertilizer LLC (“Koch Fertilizer”) are parties to an ammonia purchase and sale agreement, under which Koch Fertilizer agreed to purchase, with minimum purchase requirements, a portion of the ammonia that is in excess of EDC’s internal needs.  The term of the agreement runs until June 2022, with annual renewal options thereafter.

We operate the Baytown Facility on behalf of a global chemical company, and we believe it is one of the largest and most technologically advanced nitric acid manufacturing units in the U.S.  We operate and maintain this facility pursuant to a long-term operating contract.  The term of this agreement runs until June 2022 with options for renewal.
 Our industrial products sales volumes are dependent upon general economic conditions primarily in the housing, automotive, and paper industries.  Our sale prices generally vary with the market price of ammonia, sulfur or natural gas, as applicable, in our pricing arrangements with customers. 
 Our industrial business competes based upon service, price and location of production and distribution sites, product quality and performance and provides inventory management as part of the value-added services offered to certain customers.  See our discussion concerning a new contract to capture and sell carbon dioxide out our El Dorado Facility under “Key Operating Initiatives for 2021” in our MD&A.
 We also produce and sell LDAN, HDAN and AN solution to the mining industry, which are primarily used as AN fuel oil and specialty emulsions for usage in the quarry and the construction industries, for metals mining, and to a lesser extent, for coal mining.  We have signed long-term contracts with certain customers that provide for the annual sale of LDAN, which a portion include various natural-gas-based pricing arrangements. One of our customers has a plant located at our El Dorado Facility.  
 Raw Materials
 The products we manufacture at our facilities are primarily derived from natural gas.  This raw material feedstock is a commodity and subject to price fluctuations. Natural gas is the primary raw material for producing ammonia, UAN, nitric acid and acid blends and other products at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities.  For 2020, we purchased approximately 30.1 million MMBtus of natural gas.
 The chemical facilities’ natural gas feedstock requirements are generally purchased at spot market price.  Periodically, we enter into volume purchase commitments and/or forward contracts to lock in the cost of certain of the expected natural gas requirements primarily to match quantities needed to produce product that has been sold forward.  At December 31, 2020, we had natural gas contracts of approximately 11.1 million MMBtus, representing approximately 37% of our annual usage, at an average cost of $2.70 per MMBtu.  These contracts extend through December 2021.
 See further discussion relating to the outlook for our business under “Key Industry Factors.”
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as Austin Powder Company: CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Chemtrade Logistics L.L.C.; Cornerstone Chemical, OCI Partners NV, Dyno Nobel, a subsidiary of Incitec Pivot Limited, The Gavilon Group, Helm AG, Koch Industries, Norfalco, Nutrien, Orica Limited; Praxair, Inc., Quad Chemical Corporation, and Trammo Inc. (some of whom are our customers), many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do.  We believe that competition within the markets we serve is primarily based upon service, price, location of production and distribution sites, and product quality and performance.
Human Capital Management
 See discussion above concerning the COVID-19 pandemic under “Our Strategy.” 
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 573 persons, 188 of whom are represented by unions under agreements, including agreements being negotiated, that expire in July 2021 through November 2022. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
 
Oversight & Management
 
Our success depends on the capabilities and strength of our workforce. Our Human Resources Director is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This strategy includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our overall strategy. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) regularly updates our Board of Directors (“Board”) on the operation and status of these human capital activities including:

• | Training & Development – We are committed to the continued development of our employees. Quarterly reviews of operations and talent occur across all operational business units and corporate functions. It is the responsibility of the CEO and the executive staff to review talent data on an annual basis and plan development actions to ensure succession and continuous improvement and growth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engagement – We believe that we have favorable relations with our employees. Approximately 33% of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We take proactive measures, such as conducting employee surveys to understand and drive employee engagement. Additionally, we conduct benefit surveys annually in an effort to ensure that any changes to benefits are improvements or add value for employees. Each of our business units conducts roundtable

 Like many other companies, we have experienced challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and have focused energy and effort on protecting our employees and their families from potential virus exposure while continuing safe and compliant operations. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we established detailed plans and protocols, executed remote work arrangements, and increased communication to employees.   To date, our focused actions, which have aligned with the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have not resulted in any work stoppage.
 Government Laws and Regulations
 Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including matters regarding environmental, health and safety, many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.  Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released.  We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.  
 There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us.  These laws and regulations (including enforcement policies thereunder) have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products.  Historically, our subsidiaries have incurred significant expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations and are reasonably expected to do so in the future.  We will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our chemical facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility.
