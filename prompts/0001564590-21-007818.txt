Our Strategy
 Horizon is a leading high-growth, innovation-driven, profitable biotech company.  We are focused on rare diseases, delivering innovative therapies to patients and generating value for our shareholders.  Our strategy is to expand our development-stage pipeline for long-term sustainable growth and maximize the benefit and value of our on-market medicines, with particular focus on our key growth drivers TEPEZZA® and KRYSTEXXA®, both rare disease medicines.  Our vision is to build healthier communities, urgently and responsibly, which we believe generates value for our many stakeholders, including our shareholders.
 We have significantly transformed Horizon since our beginnings as a public company in 2011, when we had two on-market medicines and total net sales of approximately $7.0 million.  In a span of only nine years, we have evolved to a profitable, biotech company with eleven on-market medicines, seven of them for the treatment of rare diseases, total net sales in 2020 of $2.2 billion, and a growing pipeline with 14 development programs.  
 We have achieved this transformation by first building a strong commercial business as our foundation, then using the resulting cash flows to build our portfolio of rare disease medicines, including the acquisition of KRYSTEXXA, which we transformed into a key growth driver, and then building our development-stage pipeline, primarily through business development.  Our second key growth driver, TEPEZZA, is the result of our acquisition of River Vision Development Corp., or River Vision, in 2017, when TEPEZZA was a late-stage development candidate.
 We are executing on our strategy to expand our pipeline and maximize the value of our on-market medicines by leveraging the three elements that we believe set Horizon apart and are key to our success:  (i) our excellence in commercial execution; (ii) our proven and disciplined business development strategy; and (iii) our strong clinical development capability.  Through our commercial execution, we seek to accelerate the growth trajectory and maximize the potential of our medicines.  Through our strong in-house business development capability, we acquire medicines focused on opportunities in which we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive value.  We also leverage the deep collective drug development experience of our research and development organization using an agile approach to continually innovate our existing medicines and develop new medicines.
 We have two reportable segments, (i) the orphan segment (previously the orphan and rheumatology segment), our strategic growth business, and (ii) the inflammation segment, and we report net sales and segment operating income for each segment.

Impact of COVID-19
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization made the assessment that a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, had become a pandemic.  On March 13, 2020, The President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency and many states and municipalities in the United States took aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing “shelter-in-place” orders which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions).  Similarly, the Irish government limited gatherings of people and encouraged employees to work from their homes, and may implement more aggressive policies in the future.  In mid-March 2020 we implemented work-from-home policies for all employees and moved to a “virtual” model with respect to our physician, patient and partner support activities.  As certain U.S. states started to reduce restrictions, we saw physicians’ offices beginning to reopen, which reopening varied on a state-by-state basis.  As a result, our sales representatives in some areas have transitioned to being back out in the field and are working on ways to re-engage patients and physicians.  However, as COVID-19 cases have increased in certain areas, certain U.S. states have reimplemented restrictions and some physician offices re-established limits on in-person visits.  While our financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020, were strong and we continue to have a significant amount of available liquidity, we anticipate the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have a negative impact on net sales into 2021.  In addition, our clinical trials have been and may in the future be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as referred to below.
 Economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the world are continuing to change rapidly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although COVID-19 is a global issue that is altering business and consumer activity, the pharmaceutical industry is considered a critical and essential industry in the United States and many other countries and, therefore, we do not currently expect any significant extended shut downs of suppliers or distribution channels, except for the short-term disruption in TEPEZZA supply described below.  In respect of our other medicines, we believe we have sufficient inventory of raw materials and finished goods and we expect patients to be able to continue to receive their medicines at a site of care, for our infused medicines, and from their current pharmacies, alternative pharmacies or, if necessary, by direct shipment from our third-party providers that have such capability, for our other medicines.

TEPEZZA
 The launch of our infused medicine for thyroid eye disease, or TED, TEPEZZA, which was approved by the FDA on January 21, 2020, significantly exceeded our expectations.  In early 2019, we initiated our pre-launch disease awareness, market development and market access efforts with multi-functional field-based teams beginning to engage with key stakeholders in July of 2019.  We believe these pre-launch efforts, the severity and acute nature of TED, and a highly motivated patient population have generated significant demand for the medicine.  While we experienced a much higher number of new patients in 2020 than our initial estimates, the impact from COVID-19 has slowed the generation of patient enrollment forms for TEPEZZA, which drive new patient starts.  
 On December 17, 2020, we announced that we expected a short-term disruption in TEPEZZA supply as a result of recent U.S. government-mandated COVID-19 vaccine production orders pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, or DPA, that dramatically restricted capacity available for the production of TEPEZZA at our drug product contract manufacturer, Catalent Indiana, LLC, or Catalent.  Pursuant to the DPA, Catalent was ordered to prioritize certain COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing at Catalent, resulting in the cancellation of previously guaranteed and contracted TEPEZZA drug product manufacturing slots in December 2020, which were required to maintain TEPEZZA supply.  To offset the reduced slots, we accelerated plans to increase the production scale of TEPEZZA drug product at Catalent. 
 Prior to the announcement of the short-term supply disruption in TEPEZZA, we were able to meet the significantly higher than initially expected demand for TEPEZZA in 2020.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded TEPEZZA net sales of $820.0 million, which is more than 20 times greater than the expected TEPEZZA full year 2020 net sales of $30.0 million to $40.0 million that we stated in a Form 8-K filing on February 26, 2020.
 In January 2021, we submitted a prior approval supplement to the FDA to support increased scale production of TEPEZZA drug product for the treatment of TED. The submission includes data to support more product output with each manufacturing slot than is currently approved by the FDA. We will continue to discuss potential additional data requirements and the approval timeline with the FDA. We continue to anticipate the disruption could last through the first quarter of 2021. The length of the TEPEZZA supply disruption will depend on future manufacturing slots and whether future manufacturing slots are successfully completed as well as decisions by the FDA regarding the increased scale manufacturing process of TEPEZZA.  We expect to add a second drug product manufacturer by the end of 2021, a project which we initiated early in 2020.  Other than Catalent, we are not aware of any manufacturing facilities that are part of the supply chain for our medicines that are being utilized for the manufacture of vaccines for COVID-19.  At this time, we consider our inventories on hand of all our other medicines to be sufficient to meet our commercial requirements. 
 We have delayed the start of an FDA-required post-marketing study to evaluate safety of TEPEZZA in a larger patient population and retreatment rates relative to how long patients receive the medicine.  We have also delayed the start of our planned TEPEZZA clinical trial in chronic TED and an exploratory trial of TEPEZZA in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis until later in 2021, assuming commercial drug product supplies have normalized by that time.
 KRYSTEXXA
 KRYSTEXXA is an infused medicine for uncontrolled gout and was also achieving rapid growth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  While the vast majority of patients on therapy have maintained therapy, many new patients have delayed infusions due to shelter-in-place guidelines and patients voluntarily delaying visits to healthcare providers and infusion centers.  Patient visits to physicians substantially declined during 2020, which resulted in a reduction of new patients.  Although we cannot predict when healthcare activities will return to normal levels due to the continued uncertainty with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, patient demand is beginning to return with the return of healthcare activity.

5


Our other medicines
 Our other rare disease medicines, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE, treat serious, chronic diseases with serious consequences if left untreated.  It is therefore critical for patients to maintain therapy.  Patient motivation to continue treatment is high, and therefore net sales for these three medicines were stable during 2020, with less impact from COVID-19 compared to our other medicines.
 In regard to the inflammation segment, we are experiencing reduced demand given the absence of in-person engagement by our sales representatives with healthcare providers and reduced levels of non-essential patient visits to physicians.  This impact has been somewhat mitigated by the virtual engagement efforts of our sales representatives, as well as the use of telemedicine by many physicians, which allows them to continue to see patients and prescribe medicines.  In addition, with our HorizonCares program, most patients do not need to physically visit a pharmacy to obtain a prescription because the vast majority of these medicines are delivered to a patient’s home through mail or local courier, depending on the participating pharmacy.
 
Clinical trials
 Our clinical trials have been and may in the future be affected by COVID-19.  As referred to above, two of our clinical trials for TEPEZZA have been delayed due to the impact of the TEPEZZA supply disruption at Catalent.  In addition, clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital and healthcare resources toward COVID-19.  Current or potential patients in our ongoing or planned clinical trials may also choose to not enroll, not participate in follow-up clinical visits or drop out of the trial as a result of, or a precaution against, contracting COVID-19.  Further, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services.  Some clinical sites in the United States have slowed or stopped further enrollment of new patients in clinical trials, denied access to site monitors or otherwise curtailed certain operations.  Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, may be adversely impacted.  These events could delay our clinical trials, increase the cost of completing our clinical trials and negatively impact the integrity, reliability or robustness of the data from our clinical trials.  
 We are continuing to actively monitor the possible impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions to alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of patients.  There is significant uncertainty about the duration and potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This means that our results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business results and outlook represents our estimate based on the information available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 ORPHAN SEGMENT
 Our orphan segment consists of our medicines TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, BUPHENYL and QUINSAIR.  
 TEPEZZA
 TEPEZZA is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a targeted inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, or IGF-1R, that is the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of TED.  TED is a serious, progressive and vision-threatening rare autoimmune condition. While TED often occurs in people living with hyperthyroidism or Graves’ disease, it is a distinct disease that is caused by autoantibodies activating an IGF-1R-mediated signaling complex on cells within the retro-orbital space. This leads to a cascade of negative effects, which may cause long-term, irreversible eye damage. As TED progresses, it causes serious damage – including proptosis (eye bulging), strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) and diplopia (double vision) – and in some cases can lead to blindness.  Historically, patients have had to live with TED until the inflammation subsides, after which they are often left with permanent and vision-impairing consequences and may require multiple surgeries that do not completely return the patient to their pre-disease state.
 TEPEZZA was approved by the FDA in January 2020 following the positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial, as well as a Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial, OPTIC. The OPTIC trial found that significantly more patients treated with TEPEZZA (82.9%) had a meaningful improvement in proptosis (≥ 2 mm) as compared with placebo patients (9.5%) without deterioration in the fellow eye at Week 24. Additional secondary endpoints were also met, including a change from baseline of at least one grade in diplopia (double vision) in 67.9% of patients receiving TEPEZZA compared to 28.6% of patients receiving placebo at Week 24. In a related analysis of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, there were more patients with complete resolution of diplopia among those treated with TEPEZZA (53%) compared with those treated with placebo (25%). The majority of adverse events experienced with TEPEZZA treatment were graded as mild to moderate and were manageable in the trials, with few discontinuations or therapy interruptions.
 Our comprehensive post-launch commercial strategy for TEPEZZA aims to enable more TED patients to benefit from TEPEZZA.  We are doing this by: (i) facilitating continued TEPEZZA uptake in the treatment of acute and chronic TED through continued promotion of TEPEZZA to treating physicians; (ii) continuing to develop the TED market by increasing physician awareness of the disease severity, the urgency to diagnose and treat it, as well as the benefits of treatment with TEPEZZA; (iii) driving accelerated disease identification and time to treatment through our digital and broadcast marketing campaigns; (iv) enhancing the patient journey with our high-touch, patient-centric model as well as support for the patient and site-of-care referral processes; and (v) expanding more timely access to TEPEZZA for TED patients. 

8


Our first-quarter 2020 launch followed significant market-preparation initiatives for TEPEZZA in 2019 to drive awareness about TED in the medical and patient community and establish a potential pathway for treatment.  Our pre-launch market preparation initiatives have proven effective in driving the highly successful launch of TEPEZZA, which has significantly exceeded our expectations.  To advance the continued strong growth and adoption of TEPEZZA, we are investing in significant expansion efforts in multiple areas: our commercial and field-based organization for TEPEZZA, which we doubled in size to approximately 200 employees by the end of 2020; our marketing initiatives; our long-term supply capacity; and our efforts in pursuing expansion outside the United States.
 With the U.S. launch of TEPEZZA in 2020 and the demonstrated benefit it has provided U.S. patients with TED, we are pursuing a global expansion strategy to bring TEPEZZA to patients with TED in other parts of the world.  Japan is one of the countries we are pursuing, and we are engaging with Japanese regulatory authorities and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, as well as with the Japanese medical community, to better understand the current dynamics of TED in Japan and the regulatory requirements for approval of TEPEZZA.
 On December 17, 2020, we announced that we expected a short-term disruption in TEPEZZA supply as a result of recent U.S. government-mandated COVID-19 vaccine production orders pursuant to the DPA that have dramatically restricted capacity available for the production of TEPEZZA at our drug product contract manufacturer, Catalent.  See “Impact of COVID-19” above for further information.
 As the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of TED, TEPEZZA has no direct approved competition.  We believe that the results of the TEPEZZA Phase 3 and Phase 2 clinical trials present a significantly high hurdle for potential competitors, given that potentially competitive medicines would be expected to demonstrate similar or greater efficacy and safety in the treatment of TED.  In addition, we have a biologic exclusivity in the United States covering TEPEZZA that will expire in 2032. Further, the complexity of manufacturing TEPEZZA could pose a barrier to potential biosimilar competition. Although TEPEZZA does not face direct competition, other therapies, such as corticosteroids, have been used on an off-label basis to alleviate some of the symptoms of TED.  While these therapies have not proved effective in treating the underlying disease, and carry with them potential significant side effects, their off-label use could reduce or delay treatment with TEPEZZA among the addressable patient population.  Immunovant Inc., or Immunovant, is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of a fully human anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody candidate for the treatment of active TED, also referred to as Graves’ ophthalmopathy.  On February 2, 2021, Immunovant announced a voluntary pause in the clinical dosing of the candidate due to elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in patients treated with the candidate.  Immunovant has indicated it intends to continue developing the candidate but did not provide an estimate of when the dosing might resume.  Viridian Therapeutics, Inc. is pursuing development of an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for TED and has announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2021.
 KRYSTEXXA
 A PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme (uricase), KRYSTEXXA is the first and only FDA approved medicine for the treatment of uncontrolled gout.  Uncontrolled gout occurs in patients who have failed to normalize serum uric acid, or sUA, and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately controlled with conventional therapies, such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors, or XOIs, at the maximum medically appropriate dose, or for whom these drugs are contraindicated. 
 KRYSTEXXA has a unique mechanism of action that can rapidly reverse disease progression.  Unlike conventional XOI therapies, which address the over-production or under-excretion of uric acid, KRYSTEXXA converts uric acid into allantoin, a water-soluble molecule, which the body can easily eliminate through the urine.  Renal excretion of allantoin is ten times more efficient than uric acid excretion.  Additionally, many chronic kidney disease, or CKD, patients have gout, and the disease tends to be more prevalent as CKD advances.  While conventional XOI gout therapies can place additional burden on the kidneys and have dosing limitations, KRYSTEXXA has been proven effective and safe for uncontrolled gout patients with CKD without the need to adjust dosing. 
 Gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis and can be assessed by a simple blood test for the amounts of uric acid in the blood (sUA levels).  Typically in gout, when uric acid levels are greater than 6.8 milligrams per deciliter, urate will crystallize and deposit.  These hard deposits are known as tophi and may occur anywhere in the body, including joints, as well as organs, such as the kidney and heart.  When under-treated medically, tophi often lead to bone erosions and loss of functional ability.  Gout flares, a common characteristic of uncontrolled gout, are intensely painful.  They may or may not be accompanied by tophi.  A systemic disease, uncontrolled gout frequently causes crippling disabilities and significant joint damage. Of the 9.5 million gout sufferers in the United States, we estimate that greater than 100,000 patients have uncontrolled gout.   

 9


KRYSTEXXA was approved by the FDA in 2010 following the results of two replicate clinical trials six months in duration involving 85 patients treated with KRYSTEXXA.  The mean baseline sUA levels for patients in the trial were greater than 10 mg/dL, and 71 percent of patients had visible tophi.  The primary endpoint for the trials was the ability to maintain a low sUA for 80 percent of the samples taken at months three and six.  As a result of the every-other-week dosing of KRYSTEXXA at 8 mg, 42 percent of KRYSTEXXA patients achieved complete response versus 0 percent for the placebo group; and 45 percent of KRYSTEXXA patients achieved complete resolution of tophi versus 8 percent for the placebo group over six months.
 We are focused on optimizing and maximizing the benefit the medicine offers for patients as well as driving toward its peak U.S. net sales potential.  We are driving growth for KRYSTEXXA by: (i) supporting the continued adoption of the use of KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulators to increase the complete response rate of KRYSTEXXA; (ii) increasing uptake by rheumatologists; and (iii) accelerating uptake of the medicine by nephrologists.
 We doubled our KRYSTEXXA commercial team in 2018, we increased our promotional efforts to further penetrate rheumatology and initiate marketing to nephrology and we are growing our customer base through both new and existing prescribers.  In 2019, we added a separate group of sales representatives to call exclusively on nephrologists.  We believe KRYSTEXXA offers a solution to a clinical need experienced by many nephrologists in dealing with uncontrolled gout patients with CKD.    
 As the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of uncontrolled gout, KRYSTEXXA faces limited direct competition.  We believe that the complexity of manufacturing KRYSTEXXA provides a barrier to potential biosimilar competition.  However, a number of competitors have medicines in clinical trials, including Selecta Biosciences Inc., or Selecta, which has initiated a Phase 3 trial of a candidate for the treatment of chronic refractory gout.  In September 2020, Selecta announced topline clinical data that did not meet the primary endpoint or demonstrate statistical superiority for their Phase 2 trial that compared their candidate, which includes an immunomodulator, to KRYSTEXXA alone without an immunomodulator.  In July 2020, Selecta and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi, entered into a strategic licensing agreement under which Sobi will assume responsibility for certain development, regulatory, and commercial activities for this candidate.  
 RAVICTI
 RAVICTI is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and pediatric patients (beginning at birth) with urea cycle disorders, or UCDs, that cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone.  UCDs are rare, life-threatening genetic disorders.  RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (for example, essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline or protein-free calorie supplements). 
 UCDs are inherited metabolic diseases caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes or transporters that constitute the urea cycle.  The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which ammonia, a potent neurotoxin, is converted to urea, which is excreted in the urine.  UCD patients may experience episodes during which the ammonia levels in their blood become excessively high, called hyperammonemic crises, which may result in irreversible brain damage, coma or death.  We estimate that there are approximately 2,600 patients with UCDs living in the United States, including approximately 1,000 diagnosed patients.  RAVICTI is not used to treat extremely high levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemic crisis) or for N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency.
 UCD symptoms may first occur at any age depending on the severity of the disorder, with more severe defects presenting earlier in life.  However, a prompt diagnosis and careful management of the disease can lead to good clinical outcomes.
 RAVICTI is formed by the catalyzed esterification of glycerol with 4-phenylbutyric acid and the subsequent purification of the glycerol phenylbutyrate formed. The purified glycerol phenylbutyrate drug substance is filled into glass bottles for use as an oral dosage liquid.

RAVICTI competes with older-generation nitrogen scavenger medicines.  In the United States, RAVICTI competes with all forms of sodium phenylbutyrate, including BUPHENYL.  RAVICTI has advantages over older-generation medicines leading to better patient adherence and compliance rates, such as its better tolerability for patients.  It is ingested by mouth, requires little preparation and has little taste and lower sodium content than other nitrogen scavenger medications.  A few competitors have medicine candidates in early-stage development, including a gene-therapy candidate by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., a generic taste-masked formulation option of BUPHENYL by ACER Therapeutics Inc., an enzyme replacement for a specific UCD subtype (ARG) by Aeglea Bio Therapeutics Inc., and a mRNA-based therapeutic for a specific UCD subtype (OTC) by Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc.  If successful, these medicine candidates could compete with RAVICTI.
 Our strategy for RAVICTI is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of UCDs; to drive conversion to RAVICTI from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate, based on the medicine’s differentiated benefits; to position RAVICTI as the first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates.  
 On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to RAVICTI outside of North America and Japan to Immedica.  On October 27, 2020, we sold our rights to develop and commercialize RAVICTI in Japan to Immedica.  We previously distributed RAVICTI through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets.  We have retained rights to RAVICTI in North America.
 PROCYSBI
 PROCYSBI is indicated for nephropathic cystinosis, or NC, a rare lysosomal storage disorder that results in the amino acid cystine accumulating inside the lysosomes of nearly every cell.  Cystine accumulation results in the formation of crystals that lead to cell damage and death in tissues and organs throughout the body.  PROCYSBI (cysteamine bitartrate) delayed-release capsules and delayed-release oral granules is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for NC with 12-hour dosing.  PROCYSBI uses proprietary technology that releases cysteamine gradually, providing 12-hour continuous cystine control in adults and children 1 year of age and older.  PROCYSBI granules, also called “microbeads,” are composed of cysteamine bitartrate surrounded by an acid-resistant enteric coating.  The microbeads release cysteamine gradually, providing 12 hours of continuous cystine control.  To work properly, PROCYSBI microbeads must dissolve and release cysteamine bitartrate in the small intestine.  The coating on the microbeads helps to control where and how medicine is released by allowing the cysteamine bitartrate to pass through the acidic stomach to the alkaline environment of the small intestine.  Once in the small intestine, the coating begins to dissolve and the microbeads release cysteamine bitartrate gradually.  This allows PROCYSBI to control cystine levels continuously over the dosing interval.  Randomized controlled clinical trials and extended treatment with PROCYSBI therapy demonstrated consistent cystine depletion as monitored by levels of the biomarker (and surrogate marker), white blood cell cystine.
 In NC patients, elevated cystine can lead to cellular dysfunction and death; without treatment, the disease is usually fatal by the end of the first decade of life.  Cystinosis is progressive, eventually causing irreversible tissue damage and multi-organ failure, including kidney failure, blindness, muscle wasting and premature death.  NC is usually diagnosed in infancy after children display symptoms to physicians, including markedly increased urination, thirst, dehydration, gastrointestinal distress, failure to thrive, rickets, photophobia and kidney symptoms specific to Fanconi syndrome.  Management of cystinosis requires lifelong therapy.
 In February 2020, the FDA approved PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets for adults and children one year of age and older living with nephropathic cystinosis.  The PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets product is the same as the currently available PROCYSBI capsules product except in respect of the packaging format.  This new dosage form provides another administration option for patients, in addition to the PROCYSBI capsules.  The PROCYSBI Delayed-Release Oral Granules in Packets were made commercially available in April 2020.
 PROCYSBI is differentiated by its ability to control cystine concentration continuously over twelve hours.  Older therapies require administration of medicine every six hours.  By taking PROCYSBI, patients have to dose only twice a day, providing them greater control over their medication schedule and lifestyle.  Additionally, because PROCYSBI can be administered through a feeding tube or mixed with approved foods and beverages, the patient can choose a more flexible dosing regimen.  PROCYSBI may also have fewer known side effects, such as less severe body odor, than older-generation therapies. 
 11

We estimate that there are approximately 550 patients diagnosed with NC living in the United States.  In addition to patients who have already been identified, we believe that a number of patients with atypical phenotypic presentation and end-stage renal disease have their condition as a result of undiagnosed late-onset NC and would benefit from treatment with PROCYSBI.
 Other than PROCYSBI, we are aware of three pharmaceutical products currently approved to treat cystinosis, Cystagon®, Cystadrops® and Cystaran®.  Cystagon, an immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate capsule, is an older-generation systemic cystine-depleting therapy for cystinosis in the United States marketed by Mylan N.V., and by Orphan Europe SARL in markets outside of the United States.  Cystagon is PROCYSBI’s primary competitor.  Cystadrops is a recently approved (2020) cysteamine ophthalmic solution indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits and is marketed by Recordati Rare Disease Inc.  Cystaran, a cysteamine ophthalmic solution, is approved in the United States for treatment of corneal crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis and is marketed by Leadiant Biosciences, Inc.  Additionally, we are aware of an early-stage gene therapy candidate in development by AVROBIO, Inc. for the treatment of cystinosis.  We believe that PROCYSBI will continue to be well received in the market and continue to expect Cystagon to be the primary competitor for PROCYSBI for the foreseeable future. 
 Our strategy for PROCYSBI is to drive conversion of patients from older-generation immediate-release capsules of cysteamine bitartrate; to increase the uptake of the medicine by diagnosed but untreated patients; to identify previously undiagnosed patients who are suitable for treatment; to position PROCYSBI as a first line of therapy; and to increase compliance rates. 
 ACTIMMUNE
 ACTIMMUNE is indicated for chronic granulomatous disease, or CGD, and severe, malignant osteopetrosis, or SMO.  It is a biologically manufactured protein called interferon gamma-1b that is similar to a protein the human body makes naturally.  Interferon gamma helps prevent infection in CGD patients and enhances osteoclast function in SMO patients.   ACTIMMUNE is the only medicine approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with CGD and for delaying disease progression in patients with SMO.  ACTIMMUNE is believed to work by modifying the cellular function of various cells, including those in the immune system and those that help form bones.
 CGD is a genetic disorder of the immune system.  It is described as a primary immunodeficiency disorder, which means it is not caused by another disease or disorder.  In people who have CGD, a type of white blood cell called a phagocyte is defective.  These defective phagocytes cannot generate superoxide, leading to an inability to kill harmful microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.  As a result, the immune system is weakened.  People with CGD are more likely to have certain problems, such as recurrent severe and potentially life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and chronic inflammatory conditions.  These patients are prone to developing masses called granulomas, which can occur repeatedly in organs throughout the body and cause a variety of problems.  We estimate that there are approximately 1,600 patients with CGD in the United States.
 SMO is a form of osteopetrosis and is sometimes referred to as marble bone disease or malignant infantile osteopetrosis because it occurs in very young children.  While exact numbers are not known, it has been estimated that one out of 250,000 children is born with SMO. 
 ACTIMMUNE currently faces limited competition.  There are additional or alternative approaches used to treat patients with CGD and SMO, including the increasing trend towards the use of bone marrow transplants in patients with CGD, however, there are currently no medicines on the market that compete directly with ACTIMMUNE.  Orchard Therapeutics plc has an early-stage ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy candidate in development for the treatment of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease.
 Our strategy for ACTIMMUNE is to increase awareness and diagnosis of CGD; to drive utilization of ACTIMMUNE prophylaxis in newly-diagnosed CGD patients as recommended in current treatment guidelines; and increase compliance rates.

BUPHENYL
 BUPHENYL tablets and BUPHENYL powder are made from granules that contain sodium phenylbutyrate as the active (chemically synthesized) ingredient and microcrystalline cellulose as a diluent.
 BUPHENYL tablets for oral administration and BUPHENYL powder for oral, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tube administration are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with UCDs involving deficiencies of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase or argininosuccinic acid synthetase.
 BUPHENYL is indicated for treatment of all patients with neonatal-onset deficiency (complete enzymatic deficiency, presenting within the first twenty-eight days of life).  It is also indicated for treatment of patients with late-onset disease (partial enzymatic deficiency, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonemic encephalopathy.  It is important that the diagnosis be made early and treatment initiated immediately to improve clinical outcomes.  BUPHENYL must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation.  We distribute BUPHENYL in the United States.
 BUPHENYL is known as AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan.  On December 28, 2018, we sold our rights to AMMONAPS outside of North America and Japan to Immedica.  We previously distributed AMMONAPS through a commercial partner in Europe and other non-U.S. markets. On October 27, 2020, we sold our rights to develop and commercialize BUPHENYL in Japan to Immedica. We have retained our rights to BUPHENYL in North America.
 QUINSAIR
 QUINSAIR is a formulation of the antibiotic drug levofloxacin, suitable for inhalation via a nebulizer and indicated for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis, or CF.  CF is a rare, life-threatening genetic disease affecting approximately 70,000 people worldwide, and results in buildup of abnormally thick secretions that can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage in many patients that eventually leads to death.   
 QUINSAIR’s route of delivery allows higher concentrations of drug in the lung sputum than can be achieved via systemic (for example, oral) administration.  QUINSAIR, as approved in Canada and Latin America, is administered twice daily in twenty-eight-day cycles, using a hand-held nebulizer with a disposable handset known as the Zirela® device, manufactured by our partner PARI Pharma GmbH, or PARI, and configured specifically for use with QUINSAIR.  QUINSAIR is not approved in the United States.
 Chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa are currently treated primarily with inhaled antibiotics, including tobramycin, an aminoglycoside-class antibiotic sold by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation as TOBI® or in dry-powder-inhalation format as TOBI Podhaler® and sold by others in generic form, aztreonam, a monobacter-class antibiotic which is marketed in an inhaled formulation by Gilead Sciences, Inc. under the tradename Cayston®, and colistimethate sodium, a polymixin-class antibiotic which is approved and marketed in inhaled formulations in Europe.  Tobramycin, aztreonam and colistimethane are primarily effective against gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  However, the prevalence of multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is growing.  Thus, we believe there is an unmet need that might be addressed with a new class of inhaled antibiotic such as the fluoruquinolone class that levofloxacin represents.

INFLAMMATION SEGMENT
 Our inflammation segment includes PENNSAID 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS, RAYOS and VIMOVO.
 PENNSAID 2%
 PENNSAID 2% is indicated for the treatment of pain of osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee(s).  OA is a type of arthritis that is caused by the breakdown and eventual loss of the cartilage of one or more joints. 
 An analgesic that is easy-to-apply topically directly to the knee, PENNSAID 2% contains diclofenac sodium, a commonly prescribed NSAID to treat OA pain, and dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO, a penetrating agent that helps ensure that diclofenac sodium is absorbed through the skin to the site of inflammation and pain.  Topical NSAIDs such as PENNSAID 2% are generally viewed as safer alternatives to oral NSAID treatment because they reduce systemic exposure to a fraction of that of an oral NSAID.  PENNSAID 2% is the only topical NSAID offered with the convenience of a metered-dose pump, which ensures that the patient receives the correct amount of PENNSAID 2% solution with each use.  PENNSAID 2% competes primarily with the generic version of Voltaren Gel 1%, a market leader in the topical NSAID category. 
 DUEXIS
 DUEXIS is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, and OA and to decrease the risk of developing upper-GI ulcers in patients who are taking ibuprofen for these indications.  RA is a chronic disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling, primarily in the joints.
 DUEXIS provides a fixed-dose combination in tablet form of ibuprofen, the most widely prescribed NSAID, and famotidine, a well-established GI agent used to treat dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease and active ulcers. 
 Fixed-dose combination therapy provides significant advantages over multiple-pill regimens: fixed-dose combinations can reduce the number of pills taken; ensure that the correct dose of each component is taken at the correct time, improving compliance; and is often associated with better treatment outcomes.
 In general, DUEXIS faces competition from the separate use of NSAIDs for pain relief and GI medications to address the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers.  However, the prescribing information for DUEXIS states that DUEXIS should not be substituted with the single-ingredient products of ibuprofen and famotidine.  DUEXIS competes with other NSAIDs, including Celebrex®, manufactured by Pfizer Inc., and celecoxib, a generic form of the medicine supplied by other pharmaceutical companies.  DUEXIS also competes with TIVORBEX™ (indomethacin) capsules, VIVLODEX® (meloxicam) capsules and ZORVOLEX ® (diclofenac) capsules marketed by Iroko Pharmaceuticals, LLC.
 RAYOS
 RAYOS is indicated for the treatment of multiple conditions: RA; ankylosing spondylitis, or AS; polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR; primary systemic amyloidosis; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE; and a number of other conditions.  We focus our promotion of RAYOS on rheumatology indications, including RA and PMR.
 RAYOS is composed of an active core containing prednisone that is encapsulated by an inactive porous shell, and acts as a barrier between the medicine’s active core and the patient’s gastrointestinal, or GI, fluids.  RAYOS was developed using Vectura’s proprietary GeoClock™ and GeoMatrix™ technologies, for which we hold an exclusive worldwide license for the delivery of glucocorticoid, a class of corticosteroid.  The delivery system enables a delayed release, synchronizing the prednisone delivery time with the patient’s elevated cytokine levels, thereby taking effect at a physiologically optimal point to inhibit cytokine production, and thus significantly reducing the signs and symptoms of RA and PMR.
 RA is a chronic disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling, primarily in the joints; PMR is an inflammatory disorder that causes significant muscle pain and stiffness; SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects women and causes inflammation and pain in the joints and muscles as well as overall fatigue.
 14

RAYOS competes with a number of medicines in the market to treat RA, including corticosteroids, such as prednisone; traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs, such as methotrexate; and biologic agents, such as Humira and Enbrel.  The majority of RA patients are treated with DMARDs, which are typically used as initial therapy in patients with RA.  Biologic agents are typically added to DMARDs as combination therapy.  It is common for an RA patient to take a combination of a DMARD, an oral corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, and/or a biologic agent. 
 Outside the United States, RAYOS is sold and marketed as LODOTRA.  Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our license and supply agreements with Jagotec AG and Skyepharma AG, which are affiliates of Vectura.  Under these amendments, our rights to LODOTRA in Europe were transferred to Vectura.  We ceased recording LODOTRA revenue from January 1, 2019.  See “Manufacturing, Commercial, Supply and License Agreements” below for further details of the amendments.
 VIMOVO
 VIMOVO is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of OA, RA and AS and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.  It is a proprietary, fixed-dose, delayed-release tablet that combines enteric-coated naproxen, an NSAID, surrounded by a layer of immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium.  Naproxen has proven anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, and esomeprazole magnesium reduces the stomach acid secretions that can cause upper-GI ulcers.  Both naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium have well-documented and excellent long-term safety profiles, and both medicines have been used by millions of patients worldwide.  VIMOVO has been shown to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing NSAID associated gastric ulcers.
 Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., or collectively Dr. Reddy’s, for marketing a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book.  The cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Dr. Reddy’s, advising that it had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of VIMOVO before the expiration of the patents-in-suit.  On July 30, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied our request for a rehearing of the Court’s invalidity ruling against the two patents for VIMOVO coordinated-release tablets.  As a result, the District Court entered judgment in September 2019 invalidating these patents, which ended any restriction against the FDA from granting final approval to Dr. Reddy’s generic version of VIMOVO.  On February 18, 2020, the FDA granted final approval for Dr. Reddy’s generic version of VIMOVO.  On February 27, 2020, Dr. Reddy’s launched its generic version of VIMOVO in the United States.  Patent litigation against Dr. Reddy’s for infringement continues with respect to certain other patents in the New Jersey District Court.  We have repositioned our promotional efforts previously directed to VIMOVO to our other inflammation segment medicines and expect that our VIMOVO net sales will continue to decrease in future periods.  
 In addition, similar to DUEXIS, VIMOVO faces competition from the separate use of NSAIDs for pain relief and GI medications to address the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers.  However, the prescribing information for VIMOVO states that VIMOVO should not be substituted with the single-ingredient products of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium.  In addition to the generic version of VIMOVO launched by Dr. Reddy’s, VIMOVO also competes with other NSAIDs, including Celebrex, TIVORBEX, VIVLODEX and ZORVOLEX.

Research and Development 
 Our 14 research and development programs currently include preclinical and clinical development of new medicine candidates, as well as development programs that are intended to maximize the benefit and value of our existing medicines.  We devote significant resources to research and development activities associated with our medicines and medicine candidates.  The graphic below summarizes our significant research and development activities in order of the program stage, from post-market to preclinical:

Our research and development programs are focused on our development candidate HZN-825, the most recent addition to our pipeline, and growth drivers TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA.  Six of our 14 programs are expected to begin in 2021.  The following describes our programs for HZN-825, TEPEZZA and KRYSTEXXA, followed by our other clinical programs.
 HZN-825 Clinical Programs
 HZN-825 is an oral lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor (LPAR1) antagonist candidate we acquired in April 2020 that we are developing as a potential treatment of fibrotic diseases with significant unmet need.  
 LPAR1 signaling has been implicated in fibrosis and inflammation; furthermore, research, preclinical and clinical evidence supports the anti-fibrotic potential of LPAR1 antagonism across organ systems, including lung and skin. The results of an eight-week placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial of HZN-825, for example, showed evidence of potential clinical benefit in patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or dcSSc, with a numerically greater median reduction in the modified Rodnan skin thickness score, or mRSS, from baseline to Week 8.  However, the timeframe was likely too short to show statistically significant clinical benefit. Data from the 16-week open-label extension period of the same trial, however, suggest that longer treatment duration could show more meaningful benefit: 79 percent of patients (11 of 14 patients) who received 24 weeks of continuous treatment responded with a clinically significant 5-or-more point reduction in mRSS.
 Additionally, proof of concept for LPAR1 antagonism in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, has been demonstrated with differentiated forced vital capacity, or FVC, outcomes compared to the current treatments. FVC is a measure of lung capacity used to assess the progression of lung disease and the effectiveness of treatment. The mechanistic rationale for HZN-825 also supports evaluation in other interstitial lung disease, or ILD, conditions.
 Our HZN-825 clinical programs include studying HZN-825 in dcSSc and ILDs.  We expect to initiate two HZN-825 Phase 2b pivotal trials in 2021, one in dcSSc and the other in IPF.  The primary endpoint for both trials will be FVC.  

16


HZN-825 Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis 
 dcSSc is a rare, chronic, progressive autoimmune disease in which excess collagen production causes skin thickening and hardening, or fibrosis, over large areas of the skin and internal organs.  It can progress to internal organ damage.  Given that there is no compelling evidence that current treatments halt disease progression, and dcSSc has a high mortality rate, it represents a significant unmet need.  We expect to initiate a Phase 2b pivotal trial to evaluate HZN-825 in the treatment of dcSSc in 2021.  We expect to enroll approximately 300 patients, who will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive HZN-825 300 mg once daily, HZN-825 300 mg twice daily, or placebo, for 52 weeks.  The primary endpoint of the trial will be change in FVC after 52 weeks.  We expect enrollment to take approximately two years and so, with a one-year endpoint, we expect data to be available in 2024.
HZN-825 Interstitial Lung Diseases – Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
 We expect to initiate a Phase 2b pivotal trial to evaluate HZN-825 in the treatment of IPF in 2021.  This trial is part of our clinical development program for HZN-825 in ILDs.  IPF, the most common ILD, is a rare, progressive lung disease with a median survival rate of less than five years.  While current treatments may slow disease progression, there is no evidence that they stabilize or reverse the disease. In addition, significant tolerability and compliance issues are associated with the current anti-fibrotic therapies.  However, lung transplant has lower survival rates than other solid-organ transplants, and among lung transplants, survival is lower for pulmonary fibrosis patients compared with those with other diagnoses such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, IPF represents a significant unmet need.
TEPEZZA Clinical Programs
 In addition to OPTIC-X, the extension trial of the TEPEZZA Phase 3 OPTIC clinical trial, we have three other TEPEZZA programs:  TEPEZZA Chronic Thyroid Eye Disease and TEPEZZA Subcutaneous Administration, which are further studies of TEPEZZA in TED; and TEPEZZA Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis, which will explore TEPEZZA in the potential additional indication of dcSSc.  Our clinical strategy for TEPEZZA is to maximize the value of the medicine for patients and its long-term potential.  
 On December 17, 2020, we announced that we expected a short-term disruption in TEPEZZA supply as a result of recent U.S. government-mandated COVID-19 vaccine production orders pursuant to the DPA that dramatically restricted capacity available for the production of TEPEZZA at our drug product contract manufacturer, Catalent.  See “Impact of COVID-19” above for further information relating to the impact of the supply disruption on our TEPEZZA clinical programs.
 TEPEZZA Chronic Thyroid Eye Disease
 We expect to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of TEPEZZA in patients with chronic TED in 2021, contingent on the normalization of TEPEZZA supply.  The disease in patients with chronic TED is no longer progressive or inflammatory; however, patients may continue to experience proptosis, diplopia, pain and other debilitating eye symptoms that can impair their quality of life.  Signaling through the IGF-1R drives many of these symptoms.  Given that IGF-1R is still present at heightened levels in orbital fibroblasts from surgical samples of chronic TED patients, the TEPEZZA mechanism of action that inhibits IGF-1R appears to be relevant in chronic disease.  While the TEPEZZA prescribing information is broad and encompasses all patients with TED, including chronic TED patients, our objective for the Chronic Thyroid Eye Disease trial is to generate data to better inform the physician community who may wish to use TEPEZZA in treating their chronic TED patients as well as to better inform the payer community about the benefits of TEPEZZA in treating chronic TED, given that patients with chronic TED were not studied in the Phase 3 clinical program.
 Target enrollment for the chronic TED randomized controlled trial is approximately 40 patients, with a two-to-one ratio of patients who will receive infusions of TEPEZZA or placebo once every three weeks for a total of eight infusions.  The primary endpoint is the change in proptosis in the study eye from baseline at Week 24.  After the initial 24-week treatment period, proptosis non-responders may choose to enter an additional 24-week open-label treatment period.
 TEPEZZA OPTIC-X
 OPTIC-X is an extension trial of OPTIC, the TEPEZZA Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial, in which 82.9 percent of TEPEZZA patients achieved the primary endpoint, defined as a reduction of proptosis of at least 2 mm, compared to 9.5 percent of placebo patients.  
17


In OPTIC-X, placebo patients who participated in the OPTIC trial had the option to participate in the extension trial and receive eight infusions of TEPEZZA.  In July 2020, we announced OPTIC-X results that showed that 89 percent of OPTIC placebo patients who then entered OPTIC-X and received a course of TEPEZZA achieved the primary endpoint of a reduction in proptosis of 2 mm or more at Week 24.  These patients had TED diagnoses for an average of one year compared with an average of six months for patients in OPTIC.  OPTIC-X is in its final stage of completion.
 In addition, there were a small number of TEPEZZA patients in the OPTIC 48-week off-treatment follow-up period who relapsed, which was defined as: (i) patients who lost at least 2 mm of their proptosis improvement during the 48-week off-treatment period, even if the proptosis was substantially better than at OPTIC baseline; or (ii) patients who had a substantial increase in the number of inflammatory signs or symptoms during the 48-week off-treatment period without worsening proptosis.  Of the small number of TEPEZZA patients who relapsed during the off-treatment period, more than 60 percent experienced at least 2 mm of proptosis improvement with an additional course of TEPEZZA in OPTIC-X.  
 Of note, the majority of TEPEZZA patients who were proptosis responders at Week 24 of OPTIC maintained their proptosis response at Week 72, the end of the 48-week off-treatment follow-up period.  In addition, there were no new safety concerns in either the 48-week off-treatment follow-up period, or in OPTIC-X, during which patients received additional TEPEZZA treatment.  The OPTIC-X and OPTIC 48-week off-treatment follow-up period data underscore the long-term durability of clinical benefits from TEPEZZA treatment, the potential for retreatment, and the efficacy of TEPEZZA in patients with longer duration of TED.
 TEPEZZA Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis
 We plan to initiate an exploratory TEPEZZA trial in dcSSc as part of our approach to evaluate additional indications for TEPEZZA in 2021, contingent on the normalization of TEPEZZA supply.  Literature suggests that the mechanism of action of TEPEZZA, which is to block the IGF-1R, could have an impact on fibrotic processes, such as those that are relevant to dcSSc.  The objective of the exploratory trial is to investigate the safety, tolerability and effect of TEPEZZA on IGF-1R inflammatory/fibrotic biomarkers to inform potential subsequent larger and longer duration clinical trials.  
TEPEZZA Subcutaneous Administration
 The objective of the TEPEZZA subcutaneous administration trial is to explore the potential for additional administration options for TEPEZZA, which could provide greater flexibility for patients and physicians.  We initiated a pharmacokinetic trial in 2020 to explore subcutaneous dosing of TEPEZZA, which is currently administered by infusion.  In addition, in 2020 we announced a global collaboration and licensing agreement with Halozyme to develop a subcutaneous formulation using Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology.  This technology is based on its patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme, or rHuPH20, which has been shown to remove traditional limitations on the volume of biologics that can be delivered subcutaneously.  By using rHuPH20, some biologics and compounds that are administered intravenously may instead be delivered subcutaneously.  This delivery technology has been shown in studies to shorten time for administration of certain medicines.  We expect to initiate our early clinical work of TEPEZZA with the Halozyme delivery technology for subcutaneous administration in 2021.
KRYSTEXXA Clinical Programs
 Our five KRYSTEXXA programs aim to maximize the value of KRYSTEXXA in three ways:  increasing the response rate of the medicine, allowing broader populations of patients with uncontrolled gout to benefit from KRYSTEXXA and improving the patient experience with the medicine. 
 KRYSTEXXA MIRROR Randomized Clinical Trial
 We are evaluating the use of immunomodulation with KRYSTEXXA to increase the response rate of the medicine in our MIRROR randomized control trial, or RCT. 

18


As with many biologic medicines, some people treated with KRYSTEXXA develop anti-drug antibodies as part of an immune response to the medicine and lose response to therapy.  In the KRYSTEXXA Phase 3 pivotal trials, 42 percent of patients achieved a complete response, defined as the proportion of sUA responders (sUA < 6 mg/dL) at Months 3 and 6.  There is well-documented evidence that the addition of immunomodulators to biological therapies can decrease rates of immunogenicity, as the immunomodulators work to reduce the formation of anti-drug antibodies to the medicine, allowing it to maintain appropriate blood levels over a longer period of time.  Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the immunomodulation approach for KRYSTEXXA:  results of several trials and case series using KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulators have demonstrated response rates ranging between 70 and 100 percent, significantly higher than the 42 percent response rate achieved in the KRYSTEXXA Phase 3 clinical program.  
 Our MIRROR RCT, which we initiated in June 2019, is a 12-month trial evaluating KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate, the immunomodulator most commonly used by rheumatologists, and results are expected by year-end 2021.  Enrollment in the MIRROR RCT was completed in 2020 with 145 patients, exceeding its target enrollment by 10 patients.  The trial is designed to support the potential for registration and modification of our KRYSTEXXA FDA label to include immunomodulation with methotrexate. 
 The MIRROR RCT was preceded by our smaller MIRROR open-label trial, which also evaluated the use of the immunomodulator methotrexate with KRYSTEXXA to increase the response rate and was completed in 2019.  Of the 14 patients in the trial, 79 percent achieved a complete response, defined as the proportion of sUA responders (sUA < 6 mg/dL) at Month 6.  The 79 percent response rate is clinically importantly higher than the 42 percent response rate in the KRYSTEXXA Phase 3 clinical program.  No new safety concerns associated with the combination were identified. 
 One of the trials supporting the immunomodulation approach is the RECIPE trial, an investigator-initiated trial partially funded by Horizon, and the first randomized controlled trial, or RCT, to evaluate the effect of the use of KRYSTEXXA with an immunomodulator to increase the response rate.  Data presented in 2020 showed that 86 percent of patients who received KRYSTEXXA with the immunomodulator mycophenolate mofetil, or MMF, achieved a complete response rate at 12 weeks compared to 40 percent of placebo patients on KRYSTEXXA alone.  Furthermore, 68 percent of the immunomodulation patients achieved a sustained response 12 weeks off MMF but continuing on KRYSTEXXA therapy, compared to 30 percent of placebo patients.
 KRYSTEXXA PROTECT Trial in Kidney Transplant Patients with Uncontrolled Gout
 PROTECT is an open-label clinical trial evaluating the effect of KRYSTEXXA on sUA levels in adults with uncontrolled gout who have undergone a kidney transplant, with the objective of demonstrating that KRYSTEXXA can provide effective disease control in a severe uncontrolled gout population.  Kidney transplant patients have more than a tenfold increase in the prevalence of gout when compared to the general population, and literature suggests that persistently high sUA levels can be associated with organ rejection.  Managing uncontrolled gout is one of the most common and significant unmet needs of kidney transplant patients.  In January 2021, we completed enrollment in the PROTECT open-label trial.  
 We announced interim PROTECT data in 2020 that showed that KRYSTEXXA improved the management of uncontrolled gout in this very sensitive transplant population without compromising kidney function.  This data was presented as part of the 2020 American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week.  The interim data indicated that the estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measurement of kidney function, remained stable throughout the initial period of KRYSTEXXA treatment.  The data also showed reductions in pain and disability scores.
KRYSTEXXA Retreatment 
 As part of our clinical objective to explore ways for KRYSTEXXA to benefit wider uncontrolled gout patient populations, we plan to initiate an open-label trial in 2021 to evaluate KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate in patients who previously failed therapy after having developed an immune response to KRYSTEXXA when taken alone. Patients who have previously failed KRYSTEXXA have limited options available to address their uncontrolled gout. 
 KRYSTEXXA Shorter Infusion Duration
 We initiated an open-label trial in the fourth quarter of 2020 to evaluate the impact of administering KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate over a significantly shorter infusion duration.  Currently, KRYSTEXXA is infused over a two-hour or longer timeframe.  This shorter infusion duration trial is assessing up to three new infusion durations: 60-minute, 45-minute- and 30-minute durations. A shorter infusion duration could meaningfully improve the experience for patients, physicians and sites of care.

KRYSTEXXA Monthly Dosing 
 We plan to initiate an open-label trial in 2021 to evaluate a monthly dosing regimen of KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate to treat people with uncontrolled gout. The current dosing schedule for KRYSTEXXA is every other week. Our new monthly dosing trial will assess the impact on patients of receiving twice the current dose of KRYSTEXXA monthly, instead of the current bi-weekly dosing regimen.    
Other Clinical Programs
 HZN-003, HZN-007 and the HemoShear programs are all exploring innovative approaches to improve the treatment of uncontrolled gout, with the objective to enhance our leadership position in the treatment of this painful, debilitating systemic disease.
HZN-003:  Potential Next-Generation Biologic for Uncontrolled Gout Using Optimized Uricase and Optimized PEGylation Technology 
 A potential biologic for uncontrolled gout, HZN-003 is a pre-clinical, genetically engineered uricase with optimized PEGylation technology that has the potential to improve the half-life and reduce immunogenicity of this molecule.  In addition, it has the potential for subcutaneous dosing.  HZN-003 is licensed from MedImmune LLC, the global biologics research and development arm of the AstraZeneca Group.  
 HZN-007:  PASylated Uricase for Uncontrolled Gout Using Optimized Uricase and PASylation Technology
 HZN-007 is a PASylated uricase, resulting from a collaboration program to identify uncontrolled gout biologic candidates.  HZN-007 is a pre-clinical medicine candidate, using PASylation technology as a biological alternative to synthetic PEGylation.  PASylation is a novel approach for extending the half-life of pharmaceutically active proteins and reducing immunogenicity with the potential for subcutaneous dosing.  
HemoShear Gout Discovery Collaboration
 We have a collaboration agreement with HemoShear Therapeutics, LLC, to discover and develop novel therapeutics for gout.  The collaboration provides us an opportunity to address unmet treatment needs for people with gout by evaluating new targets for the control of sUA levels as well as new targets to address the inflammation associated with acute flares of gout.
Viela Clinical Programs
 On January 31, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Viela, and the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.  Viela has a deep mid-stage biologics pipeline for autoimmune and severe inflammatory diseases, with four candidates currently in nine development programs.  Each molecule targets central pathways that are implicated in a wide range of autoimmune diseases.  
 Uplizna® Clinical Programs
 Targeting the autoantibody pathway, Uplizna is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by binding to CD19, a cell-surface molecule broadly expressed throughout the B cell development, including plasmablasts.  In the autoantibody pathway, autoantibodies secreted by a subset of B cells (plasmablasts, plasma cells) attack native tissues as opposed to foreign pathogens.  Uplizna depletes B cells and the pathogenic cells that produce autoantibodies.  Uplizna was approved by the FDA in June 2020 for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD.  Viela is pursuing three additional indications for Uplizna: myasthenia gravis, IgG4-related disease and kidney transplant desensitization.  
 Myasthenia Gravis, or MG, is a chronic, rare, autoimmune neuromuscular disease that affects voluntary muscles, especially those that control the eyes, mouth, throat and limbs.  In severe cases, respiratory muscles may be compromised.  Viela initiated its Phase 3 trial in MG in the third quarter of 2020 to assess the safety and efficacy of Uplizna in this disease.    
 IgG4-related disease refers to a group of disorders marked by tumor-like swelling and fibrosis of affected organs, such as the pancreas, salivary glands and kidneys. It is primarily treated by rheumatologists, and rheumatology is one of our key therapeutic areas.  Viela has a Phase 3 trial underway to assess whether Uplizna can reduce flares in the absence of concomitant steroid treatment.  Similar to many other autoimmune diseases, chronic steroid therapy is the current treatment approach, which has a significant and toxic side-effect profile.

20


Uplizna is also being evaluated in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in kidney transplant desensitization.  Desensitization is aimed at reducing alloantibodies that often preclude patients with end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, from finding a matching organ and result in poor post-transplant outcomes through antibody mediated graft rejection.  Given the at-risk patient population studied, this trial was paused in 2020 due to COVID-19. 
 VIB4920 Clinical Programs
 VIB4920 targets the CD40/CD40 ligand co-stimulatory pathway.  In this pathway, overstimulation of immune cells can be triggered by interaction of CD40/CD40L, leading to an immune response cascade and overproduction of molecules that mediate inflammation.  Several autoimmune diseases are associated with the overactivation of the CD40/CD40 ligand co-stimulatory pathway. A CD40 ligand antagonist, VIB4920 is a fusion protein that binds to CD40 ligand, disrupting this pathway and reducing autoantibody production.  VIB4920 is being studied by Viela for three potential indications:  Sjögren’s syndrome, kidney transplant rejection and RA.
 Sjögren’s syndrome, the second most common rheumatic disease after RA, is a chronic, systemic autoimmune condition that impacts exocrine glands, including the salivary glands and tear glands.  Inflammation and destruction of these glands lead to dry eye and dry mouth.  In severe cases, the joints, lungs, skin, blood and kidneys may be also affected.  There are currently no treatments approved for Sjögren’s syndrome.  In patients with for Sjögren’s syndrome, both CD40 ligand and its receptor, CD40, are overexpressed in inflamed tissues.  Targeting this pathway with VIB4920 may reduce inflammation and tissue damage.  VIB4920 is in a Phase 2b trial for Sjögren’s syndrome.
 Kidney transplant rejection occurs when the immune system detects an organ transplant as a threat and attacks it, resulting in organ rejection.  The current standard of care to prevent transplant rejection involves a combination of various immunosuppressants and calcineurin inhibitors, the latter of which is associated with kidney toxicity. Viela is conducting a small Phase 2 proof-of-concept study with VIB4920 in kidney transplant rejection, evaluating if a combination of the immunosuppressant, belatacept, and VIB4920 can be effective in preventing transplant rejection while reducing renal toxicity. 
 VIB4920 is also in a Phase 2 trial in active RA, a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by progressive destruction of the joints. The primary objectives of this study are to better understand the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of VIB4920 and to further optimize its dosing regimen.
 VIB7734 Clinical Programs
 VIB 7734 targets the innate immunity pathway.  In this pathway, there is an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs.  pDCs play a critical role in autoimmune signaling, inflammation and associated tissue damage through cytokine production.  VIB7734 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to a unique cell surface receptor on pDCs called ILT7, causing pDC depletion.  Depleting these cells may interrupt the vicious cycle of inflammation that causes tissue damage in diseases such as lupus, dermatomyositis and a variety of other autoimmune conditions.  VIB 7734 has the potential to become a novel treatment for autoimmune diseases in which pDCs overproduce interferons and other types of cytokines and chemokines.  Viela is conducting two trials in VIB7734, one for SLE and one for COVID-19-related acute lung injury.
 pDCs play a key role in SLE, a systemic autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks an individual’s tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by SLE can affect many different body systems, including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. With only one biologic approved and substantial room for improved efficacy, SLE represents a significant unmet need. Viela recently announced plans for a Phase 2 trial in SLE after demonstrating encouraging results from their Phase 1b cutaneous lupus erythematosus trial that suggested that VIB7734 has the potential to meaningfully reduce skin lesions in lupus patients.  The Phase 2 trial in SLE is expected to begin in the first half of 2021.  
 COVID-19-related acute lung injury is the result of immune overactivation which can cause lung injury.  VIB7734 is also in Phase 1 development for COVID-19-related acute lung injury. 
 VIB1116 Clinical Program
 VIB1116 is a monoclonal antibody expected to begin a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in mid-2021 for autoimmune diseases.

Sales and Marketing
 As of December 31, 2020, our sales force was composed of approximately 460 sales representatives consisting of approximately 215 orphan sales representatives and 245 inflammation sales representatives. 
 Our orphan sales representatives focus on marketing our rare disease medicines to a limited number of healthcare practitioners who specialize in fields such as pediatric immunology, allergy, infectious diseases, metabolic disorders, rheumatology, nephrology, ophthalmology and endocrinology, to help them understand the potential benefits of our medicines.  We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, agreements with third parties for commercialization of our medicines outside the United States.
 We offer discount card and other programs such as our HorizonCares program to patients under which the patient receives a discount on his or her prescription.  In certain circumstances when a patient’s prescription is rejected by a managed care vendor, we will pay for the full cost of the prescription.  Patients are able to fill prescriptions for our inflammation medicines through pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient assistance program, as well as other pharmacies.  In addition, we have business arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement of our inflammation medicines.  The business arrangements with the PBMs generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payers for qualifying prescriptions.
 We have a comprehensive compliance program in place to address adherence with various laws and regulations relating to our sales, marketing, and manufacturing of our medicines, as well as certain third-party relationships, including pharmacies.  Specifically with respect to pharmacies, the compliance program utilizes a variety of methods and tools to monitor and audit pharmacies, including those that participate in our patient assistance programs, to confirm their activities, adjudication and practices are consistent with our compliance policies and guidance.

 We will only be able to protect our technologies and medicines from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them.  As such, our commercial success will depend in part on receiving and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our technologies and medicines as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges.
 The patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved.  No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies’ patents has emerged to date in the United States.  The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain.  Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property.  Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.  For example:
  
• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it is possible that none of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications of our licensors will result in issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our issued patents and the issued patents of our licensors may not provide a basis for commercially viable drugs, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not be successful in any patent litigation to enforce our patent rights, including our pending patent litigation regarding PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and/or PROCYSBI;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not develop additional proprietary technologies or medicine candidates that are patentable; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.

 For a description of our legal proceedings related to intellectual property matters, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our medicines successfully depends in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payers, including, in the United States, government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private health insurers.  Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  This is especially true in markets where over-the-counter and generic options exist.  Even if coverage is made available by a third-party payer, the reimbursement rates paid for covered medicines might not be adequate.  For example, third-party payers may use tiered coverage and may adversely affect demand for our medicines by not covering our medicines or by placing them in a more expensive formulary tier relative to competitive medicines (where patients have to pay relatively more out of pocket than for medicines in a lower tier).  We cannot be certain that our medicines will be covered by third-party payers or that such coverage, where available, will be adequate, or that our medicines will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies.  Many states in the United States have also created preferred drug lists for use in their Medicaid programs and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate.  The industry competition to be included on such formularies and preferred drug lists often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies.  Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient assistance to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other therapeutic alternative is available.  In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process.  We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any medicine to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our medicines for formulary coverage and reimbursement.  Even with studies, our medicines may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than competitive medicines, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for our medicines or our medicine candidates.  These pricing and reimbursement pressures may create negative perceptions to any medicine price increases, or limit the amount we may be able to increase our medicine prices, which may adversely affect our medicine sales and results of operations.  Where coverage and reimbursement are not adequate, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such medicines, and patients may decline to purchase them.  This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our medicines and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 The U.S. market has seen a trend in which retail pharmacies have become increasingly involved in determining which prescriptions will be filled with the requested medicine or a substitute medicine, based on a number of factors, including potentially perceived medicine costs and benefits, as well as payer medicine substitution policies.  Many states have in place requirements for prescribers to indicate “dispense as written” on their prescriptions if they do not want pharmacies to make medicine substitutions; these requirements are varied and not consistent across states.  We may need to increasingly spend time and resources to ensure the prescriptions written for our medicines are filled as written, where appropriate.
 Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and medicine pricing regulation have been subject to significant change, and may change further at any time, particularly given recent political focus on the pharmaceutical industry.  Even if favorable coverage and adequate reimbursement status is attained for one or more medicines, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose extensive requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, labeling, marketing, promotion, pricing, import, export, storage and distribution of medicines.  These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics.  Failure to comply with applicable FDA or foreign regulatory agency requirements may result in warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, additional reporting obligations and/or agency oversight, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of medicines, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a medicine from the market. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and biologics additionally under the Public Health Service Act.  The process required by the FDA before medicine candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests and pre-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicine candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or BLA as appropriate, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the medicine candidate for the indication for use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within sixty days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, regulations for pharmaceuticals; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the medicine in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our medicine candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 The results of pre-clinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular medicine candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA.  The IND automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the thirty-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. IND submissions may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.  A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during medicine development.  Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed.  The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.  Similar requirements to the U.S. IND are required in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and other jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials.
 Clinical Trials.  For purposes of NDA or BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the medicine candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, typically in healthy humans, but in some cases in patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the medicine for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31

 
• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the medicine is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a medicine candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the medicine after approval under a post-marketing commitment or post- marketing requirement. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved a medicine. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of drug development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, as appropriate.  Applications also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control information.  Applications must be accompanied by a significant user fee.  Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within twelve months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, eight months from submission.  The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.  The FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer to ensure that the medicine can be reliably produced in compliance with cGMPs and will typically inspect certain clinical trial sites for compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP.  The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.  The FDA may deny approval of an application by issuing a Complete Response Letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.  A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing.  Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data.  Approval may occur with boxed warnings on medicine labeling or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a medicine.  Once issued, the FDA may withdraw medicine approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the medicine reaches the market.  In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved medicines which have been commercialized and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a medicine based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 Clinical Trials in the EU.  Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the international council for harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCP.  Additional GCP guidelines from the EC, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products.  The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide “no fault” compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee.  The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation.  Currently, clinical trial authorization applications must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU Member State in which the trial will be conducted.  Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is expected to take effect in 2021, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only a limited involvement.  Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.  The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national medicines regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program.  At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.  A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure.  Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs.
 32

Orphan Medicines.  Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a medicine as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a medicine available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the medicine.  A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition.  If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use.  Orphan drug designation does not shorten the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a medicine with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the medicine generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances.  Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications.  If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.  Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another medicine under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent medicine with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved medicine on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
 In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a medicine can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the EC if its sponsor can establish: that the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment.  For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.  Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States (extendable to twelve years for medicines that have complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006) and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees.  However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the regulatory exclusivity period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities.  Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this medicine is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.  The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is largely aligned with the position in the EU, but is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain (for further details on the impact the United Kingdom, or UK, leaving the EU has and will have, see the section entitled ‘The Impact of Brexit’ below).
 33

Other Regulatory Requirements.  Medicines manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual medicine quality review, payment of program fees and reporting requirements.  Adverse event experience with the medicine must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA.  Our medicines may be subject to REMS requirements that affect labeling, distribution or post market reporting.  Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.  Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and untitled letters or warning letters that could cause us or our third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities.  A Form 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidelines.  In addition to Form 483 notices and untitled letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of medicine, injunctive action, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, import alert or possible civil penalties.  The FDA may also require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval for that medicine. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceuticals, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet, including certain social media activities.  Medicines may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.  Further, if there are any modifications to the medicine, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental application, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, untitled letters, corrective advertising and potential administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight by the agency, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to sell our medicines or operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results. 
 Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available pharmaceuticals for uses that are not described in the medicine’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA.  Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties.  Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances.  The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments.  The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.  Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of medicines for off-label uses and other sales practices.  These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of medicines for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.  If our promotional activities, including any promotional activities that a contracted sales force may perform on our behalf, fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities.  In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw an approved medicine from the market, require corrective advertising or a recall or institute fines or civil fines, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.  In addition, the distribution of prescription medicines is subject to the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states.  Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription medicine samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs.  Further, under the Drug Quality and Security Act, drug manufacturers are subject to a number of requirements, including, medicine identification, tracing and verification, among others, that are designed to detect and remove counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise potentially harmful drugs from the U.S. drug supply chain.
 Outside the United States, the ability of our partners and us to market a medicine is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities.  The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and region to region.

The EU and the EEA consist, at the time of writing, of the twenty-seven Member States of the EU (for details on the impact the UK leaving the EU has and will have, see the section entitled “The Impact of Brexit” below), plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein which are Member States of the EEA.  These Member States have all acceded to the single market rules governing the supervision of medicinal products.  Under the prevailing rules, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.  There are three procedures for an MA to be obtained: 
  
• | the Centralized MA, which is issued by the EC through the Centralized Procedure, based on the scientific opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU/EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as (i) biotechnology medicinal products such as genetic engineering, (ii) orphan medicinal products, (iii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU/EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized Procedure MAs are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. An identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS, to lead the evaluation of the regulatory submission. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet as distilled from the preliminary evaluation, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the RMS records the agreement, closes the procedure and informs the applicant accordingly. Each Member State concerned by the procedure is required to adopt a national decision to grant a national MA in conformity with the approved assessment report, SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet as approved. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, the granted national MA can be used for mutual recognition in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure resulting in progressive national approval of the product in the EU/EEA. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by a single competent authority of the Member States of the EEA and only covers their respective territory, are also available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Once a product has been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA through the National Procedure, this National MA can also be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authority(ies) of the Member State(s) of the EEA prepare an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product against the scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004/EC and Directive 2001/83/EC (each as amended), the EU has adopted a harmonized approach to data and market protection or exclusivity (known as the 8 + 2 + 1 formula).  The data exclusivity period begins to run on the date when the first MA is granted in the EU.  It confers on the MA holder of the reference medicinal product eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of market exclusivity.  A reference medicinal product is defined to mean a medicinal product authorized based on a full dossier consisting of pharmaceutical and pre-clinical testing results and clinical trial data, such as a medicinal product containing a new active substance.  The ten-year market protection can be extended cumulatively to a maximum period of eleven years if during the first eight years of those ten years of protection period, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. 
 The exclusivity period means that an applicant for a generic medicinal product is not permitted to rely on pre-clinical pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical data contained in the file of the reference medicinal product of the originator until the first eight years of data exclusivity have expired.  Thereafter, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the pre-clinical and clinical data relating to the reference medicinal product to support approval of the generic product.  However, a generic product cannot market until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product or eleven years if the protection period is extended, based on the formula of 8+2+1.
 35

In addition to the above, where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, a non-cumulative period of one year of data exclusivity may be granted, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication.  Finally, where a change of classification of a medicinal product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-clinical tests or clinical trials, the competent authority shall not refer to the results of those tests or trials when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of marketing authorization for a change of classification of the same substance for one year after the initial change was authorized.
 The 8 + 2 + 1 exclusivity scheme applies to products that have been authorized in the EU by the EC through the Centralized Procedure or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA nationally, including through the Decentralized and Mutual Recognition procedures. 
 For a medicinal product which has received orphan designation under Regulation 141/2000, it will, as set out in further detail in the section entitled ‘Orphan Medicines’ above, benefit from a period of ten years of orphan market exclusivity which essentially constitutes a period of market monopoly.  During this period of orphan market exclusivity, no EU regulatory authority is permitted to accept or approve an application for marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product or an extension application for the same therapeutic indication.  This period can be extended cumulatively to a total of twelve years if the marketing authorization holder or applicant complies with the requirements for an agreed pediatric investigation plan pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006.  
 The holder of a Centralized MA or National MA is subject to various obligations under the applicable EU laws, such as pharmacovigilance obligations, requiring it to, among other things, report and maintain detailed records of adverse reactions, and to submit periodic safety update reports, or PSURs, to the competent authorities.  All new marketing authorization applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited.  Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. The holder must also ensure that the manufacturing and batch release of its product is in compliance with the applicable requirements.  The MA holder is further obligated to ensure that the advertising and promotion of its products complies with applicable EU laws and industry code of practice as implemented in the domestic laws of the Member States of the EU/EEA.  The advertising and promotional rules are enforced nationally by the EU/EEA Member States.
 The Impact of Brexit.  The withdrawal of the UK from the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) took effect on January 31, 2020.  Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period that ended December 31, 2020, during which EU rules continued to apply.  A Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the TCA, that outlines the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU was agreed in December 2020.  Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the UK applicable to our business and our products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has materially impacted the regulatory regime in the UK with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products. The regulatory changes that are a result of Brexit may also materially impact upon the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products in the EU, should any development or manufacture of these products take place in the UK.
 Great Britain is no longer covered by the EU’s procedures for the grant of marketing authorizations (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate marketing authorization will be required to market drugs in Great Britain.   However, for two years from January 1, 2021, the UK’s regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the EC on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the EEA (although in both cases a marketing authorization will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the UK, Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). 

 36


The data exclusivity periods in the UK are currently in line with those in the EU, but the TCA provides that the periods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, and so there could be divergence in the future.  It is currently unclear whether the MHRA in the UK is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive.
 Orphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain as opposed to the current position where prevalence in the EU is the determinant.  It is therefore possible that conditions that are currently designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain will no longer be and that conditions that are not currently designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain.  
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws.  As a pharmaceutical company, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business.  We may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.  For example, in the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations.  Violations of these laws can lead to significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.  These laws are applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, such as us, and pharmacies, hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The term “remuneration” is defined as any remuneration, direct or indirect, overt or covert, in cash or in kind, and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute may have been violated, and enforcement will depend on the relevant facts and circumstances.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to state that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.  In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or to have offered improper inducements to federal health care program beneficiaries to select a particular provider or supplier.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry.  Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors.  In addition, where such activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our activities with physician customers, pharmacies, and patients, as well as our activities pursuant to partnerships with other companies and pursuant to contracts with contract research organizations, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 37

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.  A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government.  In addition, the ACA specified that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.  The False Claims Act has been the basis for numerous enforcement actions and settlements by pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies in connection with various alleged financial relationships with customers.  In addition, a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached substantial financial settlements in connection with allegedly causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.  Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws, as well as physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark Law, which prohibit a physician from making a referral to certain designated health services with which the physician or the physician’s family member has a financial interest and prohibit submission of a claim for reimbursement pursuant to the prohibited referral.  The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery.  In addition, various states have enacted similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including, without limitation, false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and laws analogous to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer, and there are also federal criminal false claims laws. 
 Separately, there are a number of other fraud and abuse laws that pharmaceutical manufacturers must be mindful of, particularly after a medicine candidate has been approved for marketing in the United States.  For example, a federal criminal law enacted as part of, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers.  The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.  There are also federal civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, as well as federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 We are also subject to analogous foreign laws of each of the above federal healthcare laws and foreign jurisdictions may require the implementation of compliance programs, disclosure of any gifts, compensation, or other remuneration provided to health professionals.  
 Privacy and Security Laws.  We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.  Among other things, HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors.  In addition to possible civil and criminal penalties for violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.  
 38

In the EU/EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, went into effect in 2018 and replaced Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Privacy Directive).  The GDPR applies to identified or identifiable personal data processed by automated means (for example, a computer database of customers) and data contained in, or intended to be part of, non-automated filing systems (traditional paper files) as well as transfer of such data to a country outside of the EU/EEA.  Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.  The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and creates additional rights for data subjects.  Further, on July 16, 2020, Europe’s top court, the Court of Justice of the EU, ruled in Schrems II (C-311/18) that the Privacy Shield, used by thousands of companies to transfer data between the EU and United States and upon which we relied, was invalid and could no longer be used due to the strength of United States surveillance laws.  We continue to use alternative transfer mechanisms including the standard contractual clauses, or SCCs, while the authorities interpret the decisions and scope of the invalidated Privacy Shield and the alternative permitted data transfer mechanisms.  The SCCs, though approved by the EC, have faced challenges in European courts (including being called into question in Schrems II), and may be challenged, suspended or invalidated.
 The UK’s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to as Brexit, and ongoing developments in the UK have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK.  As of January 1, 2021, and the expiry of transitional arrangements agreed to between the UK and EU, data processing in the UK is governed by a UK version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which potentially authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations.  Pursuant to the TCA, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, the UK and EU agreed to a specified period during which the UK will be treated like an EU member state in relation to transfers of personal data to the UK for four months from January 1, 2021.  This period may be extended by two further months.  Unless the EC makes an ‘adequacy finding’ in respect of the UK before the expiration of such specified period, the UK will become an ‘inadequate third country’ under the GDPR and transfers of data from the EEA to the UK will require a ‘transfer mechanism,’ such as the standard contractual clauses.  Furthermore, following the expiration of the specified period, there will be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of the data protection law as between the UK and EEA. 
Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020.  The CCPA has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States since it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households (including health information).  The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in the November 3, 2020 election.  Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information.  The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA.  It is unclear how the CCPA and CPRA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
  “Sunshine” and Marketing Disclosure Laws.  There are an increasing number of federal and state “sunshine” laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information.  Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, and make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices.  In addition, a similar federal requirement requires certain manufacturers, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, to track and report to the federal government the following: certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.  Certain states, such as Massachusetts, also make the reported information publicly available.  In addition, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed and comply with codes of conduct, transparency reporting, and other obligations.  These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities with respect to our medicines in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us.  If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.  In the EU/EEA, declaration of transfers of value to healthcare professionals is subject to the requirements under the voluntary industry code of practice.  France however has a statutory regime similar to the U.S. Sunshine Act.
 39

Government Price Reporting.  For those marketed medicines which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require medicines be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program).  We are also required to discount such medicines to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply.  These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear.  Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties.  One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs, respectively, is the “additional rebate”, a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the extent that a branded drug’s price increases over time more than the rate of inflation (based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers).  This comparison is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer.  This “additional rebate” calculation can, in some cases where price increases have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100 percent of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny.  Governments influence the price of medicinal products in the EU through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers.  Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed.  To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies.  Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits.  The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense.  As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.
 Penalties.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities in the United States could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.  Moreover, state governmental agencies may propose or enact laws and regulations that extend or contradict federal requirements.  If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the state or federal laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.  To the extent that any medicine we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.  Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.  We maintain a comprehensive healthcare corporate compliance program.  Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks and risks of regulatory non-compliance cannot be entirely eliminated.  Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.  Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign privacy, security, sunshine, government price reporting, and fraud laws may prove costly.
Impact of Healthcare Reform and Recent Public Scrutiny of Drug Pricing on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing.  In the United States and other potentially significant markets for our medicines, federal and state lawmakers and regulatory authorities as well as third-party payers are increasingly attempting to regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative medicines and therapies, which has resulted in delays of coverage decisions, barriers for product access including higher patient copays and in certain cases, leads to lower average net selling prices.  Further, there is increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices by federal and state lawmakers and enforcement authorities.  In addition, there is an emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country-specific and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU, both of which will put additional pressure on medicine pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future medicine sales and results of operations.  These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. 
 40

The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our medicines profitably.  Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs (including a number of proposals pertaining to prescription drugs, specifically), improving quality and/or expanding access.  In the United States, some of the additional proposals to reduce the cost of prescription drug prices considered at the federal level include directing Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers for the costliest drugs; various Medicare Part D and Medicaid reforms; price reporting transparency; importation rulemaking; an international pricing index proposal to require additional discounts to Medicare, as well as a proposal requiring manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if the price of a Medicare Part B or Part D drug increases more than the rate of inflation.  Also at the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives.   For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals.  As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada.  Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law.  The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation.  The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021.  Further, in November 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which  Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita.  The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027.  On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule.  However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives.  
Congress continued to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  For example, in June 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill, H.R. 1425, “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act”, which would strengthen and expand parts of the ACA and incentivize Medicaid expansion, but also proposes to implement a “Fair Price Negotiation Program” to utilize international price referencing metrics for certain drugs that are considered high-cost or are reimbursable by both Medicare Part D and Part B, while giving commercial payers, including employer and individual market plans, access to the reference price. The majority of our medicines are purchased by private payers, and much of the focus of pending legislation is on government program reimbursement. Additionally, certain proposals have been contemplated that would implement a cap on annual price increases for certain drugs covered under Medicare at the rate of inflation or require the respective manufacturers to pay a rebate.  There has also been advocacy for increasing the Medicaid drug rebates cap, currently at 100% of a drug's average manufacturer price or removing such cap in its entirety.
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.  In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs, biological products and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.  
 Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payers and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. There also has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods.  There have been several recent state and federal lawmaker inquiries, proposed legislation and enacted legislation as was the case in California designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, by requiring drug companies to notify insurers and government regulators of price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for the increase.  There have also been actions to review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  Further, a growing number of states have implemented, or are contemplating implementing, drug affordability boards to establish “allowable rates” for certain high-cost drugs identified by such boards. 
 41

In addition to the aforementioned price reform measures, there are other potential reform measures relating to the pharmaceutical industry that may impact our business.  For example, there have been efforts to amend the Orphan Drug Act, including a bill passed in the House of Representatives in November 2020, the Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act, that would have limited manufacturers’ ability to receive orphan drug exclusivity under the “cost recovery” pathway under the Orphan Drug Act.  While the Senate did not take further action on this bill in 2020, the bill’s co-sponsors were re-elected, and it remains unclear whether it will be re-introduced.  Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that broadened the definition of “line extension” under the ACA.  It is unclear whether this final rule will be challenged similar to other final rules that were issued shortly prior to the change in presidential administration.  
 In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the ACA.  The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.  It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business.  There were efforts by the Trump administration as well as judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the ACA.  These challenges include Executive Orders directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA, to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or eliminate the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices as well as legislation passed by the House of Representatives and Senate, but not yet signed into law, to repeal certain aspects of the ACA.   While Congress has not passed comprehensive ACA repeal or replace legislation, the federal income tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”.  On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well.  The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case but it is unclear when a decision will be made. Although the United States Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.  There is a wide range of potential outcomes to this litigation and it is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA’s many different provisions affecting the health system, the pharmaceutical sector and our business. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and additional actions to possibly repeal and replace it has on our business.
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted.  For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken.  However, COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030.  The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.  Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.  In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of medicines, including our medicine candidates.  Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.  Further, the BBA among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans (also known as the Medicare “Donut Hole”), and also increased in 2019 the percentage that a drug manufacturer must discount the cost of prescription drugs from 50 percent under current law to 70 percent.  The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our medicines.

Irish Law Matters
 As we are an Irish-incorporated company, the following matters of Irish law are relevant to the holders of our ordinary shares. 
 Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital.  Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions imposed specifically on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies.  Dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities.  The Financial Transfers Act 1992 gives power to the Minister for Finance of Ireland to restrict financial transfers between Ireland and other countries and persons.  Financial transfers are broadly defined and include all transfers that would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the member states of the EU.  The acquisition or disposal of interests in shares issued by an Irish incorporated company and associated payments falls within this definition.  In addition, dividends or payments on redemption or purchase of shares and payments on a liquidation of an Irish incorporated company would fall within this definition.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (as amended) also gives the Minister of Finance of Ireland the power to take various measures, including the freezing or seizure of assets, in order to combat terrorism.  At present the Financial Transfers Act 1992, certain EU regulations (as implemented into Irish law) and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 (as amended) prohibit financial transfers involving certain persons and entities associated with the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida organizations, the late Slobodan Milosevic and associated persons, Republic of Guinea-Bissau, Myanmar/Burma, Belarus, certain persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the late Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaida, the Taliban of Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Iran, Iraq, Côte d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Liberia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Republic of Guinea, Afghanistan, Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ukraine, Yemen, Bosnia and Herzegovina, certain known terrorists and terrorist groups, and countries that harbor certain terrorist groups, without the prior permission of the Central Bank of Ireland or the Minister of Finance (as applicable). 
 Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations or EU sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law. 
 
Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders 
 Withholding Tax on Dividends.  While we have no current plans to pay dividends, dividends on our ordinary shares would generally be subject to Irish Dividend Withholding Tax, or DWT, at the rate of 25 percent, unless an exemption applies. 
 Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the United States and held beneficially through the Depositary Trust Company, or DTC, will not be subject to DWT provided that the address of the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares in the records of the broker is in the United States. 
 Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the United States and held directly (outside of DTC) will not be subject to DWT provided that the shareholder has completed the appropriate Irish DWT form and this form remains valid or provides a Certification of U.S. Tax Residency, or Form IRS 6166.  Such shareholders must provide the appropriate Irish DWT form or Form IRS 6166 to our transfer agent at least seven business days before the record date for the first dividend payment to which they are entitled. 
 If any shareholder who is resident in the United States receives a dividend subject to DWT, he or she should generally be able to make an application for a refund from the Irish Revenue Commissioners on the prescribed form (DWT Claim Form 1).
 While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding tax, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from DWT available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions. 
   Income Tax on Dividends.  A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is entitled to an exemption from DWT generally has no additional liability to Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us.
 43

A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is not entitled to an exemption from DWT generally has no additional liability to Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us.  The DWT deducted by us discharges the liability to Irish income tax and to the universal social charge.
 Irish Tax on Capital Gains.  A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and does not hold our ordinary shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholder in Ireland through a branch or agency should not be within the charge to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of our ordinary shares. 
 Capital Acquisitions Tax.  Irish capital acquisitions tax, or CAT, is composed principally of gift tax and inheritance tax.  CAT could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties.  This is because our ordinary shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland as our share register must be held in Ireland.  The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. 
 CAT is levied at a rate of 33 percent above certain tax-free thresholds.  The appropriate tax-free threshold is dependent upon (i) the relationship between the donor and the donee and (ii) the aggregation of the values of previous gifts and inheritances received by the donee from persons within the same category of relationship for CAT purposes.  Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT.  Our shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to whether CAT is creditable or deductible in computing any domestic tax liabilities. 
 Stamp Duty.  Irish stamp duty (if any) may become payable in respect of ordinary share transfers.  However, a transfer of our ordinary shares from a seller who holds shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired shares through DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.  A transfer of our ordinary shares (i) by a seller who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC to any buyer, or (ii) by a seller who holds the ordinary shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired ordinary shares outside of DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1 percent of the price paid or the market value of the ordinary shares acquired, if greater).  The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the buyer or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or for less than market value, all parties to the transfer. 
 A shareholder who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC may transfer those ordinary shares into DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer into DTC there is no sale of those book-entry interests to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.  Similarly, a shareholder who holds ordinary shares through DTC may transfer those ordinary shares out of DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares (and in exactly the same proportions) as a result of the transfer, and at the time of the transfer out of DTC there is no sale of those ordinary shares to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.  In order for the share registrar to be satisfied as to the application of this Irish stamp duty treatment where relevant, the shareholder must confirm to us that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC (and in exactly the same proportions) (or vice-versa) as a result of the transfer and there is no agreement for the sale of the related book-entry interest or the ordinary shares or an interest in the ordinary shares, as the case may be, by the shareholder to a third party being contemplated.
 Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,395 full-time employees.  Of our employees as of December 31, 2020, approximately 290 were engaged in development, regulatory and manufacturing activities, approximately 820 were engaged in sales and marketing and approximately 285 were engaged in administration, including business development, finance, legal, information systems, facilities and human resources.  None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We consider our employee relations to be good.  We are committed to strict policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment.  The health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern.  
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees.  In addition to competitive base salaries, the other competitive benefits that we provide to all employees, include annual equity and cash incentive plans, retirement benefits and an employee share purchase plan.  The principal purposes of these employee benefits are to attract, retain and reward personnel and also, through the granting of share-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to secure and retain the services of our employees and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of employees with the interests of our shareholders.

Our Core Values
 Our culture is reflected in Horizon’s three core values: growth, accountability and transparency. Through these core values, our teams of highly engaged employees work to better the lives of patients and the community.  This engagement is fostered by our strong emphasis on creating a diverse and inclusive culture that drives how we treat employees and expect employees to treat one another.
 Growth:  Horizon is a high-growth organization that values innovation, development and evolution.  We are fiercely innovating to better our communities, our patients and our employees and place a strong emphasis on personal and professional growth.  Employees have access to resources to develop their teams and themselves.  
 Accountability: We strive to do what’s right for patients and employees through quality decisions and owning successes and failures.  Employees hold each other accountable to make quality decisions that keep our company moving forward in order to meet the needs of patients. 
 Transparency: Horizon values the collaboration that is made possible by employees trusting each other to tackle tough challenges and difficult conversations.  We are courageous in our decision making, knowing it's necessary to drive our business forward.
 Our Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
 Horizon’s commitment to its employees has been exemplified during the COVID-19 crisis.  At the onset of the pandemic, in addition to working to support patients, physicians and our communities, we took steps to ensure the health, safety and welfare of our employees, including:
  
• | implementing travel restrictions and remote working;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | providing a special one-time bonus for all employees, excluding executive officers, to support our employees through the pandemic and to show our appreciation for their efforts and dedication during the challenging period;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implementing a COVID-19 leave policy with 100% pay continuation for U.S. employees affected by the virus or needing to care for a family member with the virus, and paid leave for medical professional employees who wished to assist with pandemic-related efforts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing employees with personal protective equipment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | making no furloughs or lay-offs as a result of the pandemic.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, after noticing that employees were not taking time off in this “work from home” environment, we instituted three additional company-wide paid days off during 2020, providing an opportunity for employees to step away, support their health and well-being, and recharge.  Furthermore, we allowed an additional five days of unused paid time off to be carried over to 2021.  In addition to our multiple established leadership development programs, we hosted 24 teleconference calls with over 250 leaders in 2020, with 13 hours of content focused on helping managers lead their teams during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing remote working environment, primarily focusing on employee engagement, well-being, team effectiveness, supporting caregivers and mitigating burnout.  Flexibility is driven by our executive leadership and managers, encouraging employees to work adaptable hours and take breaks where needed and when possible.

Focus on Employee Benefits 
 At the center of our employee experience is how we reward our employees for the impact they create.  We absorb most of the costs for employee medical insurance plans.  In addition to medical insurance, we offer a wide variety of benefits that support working families. This includes our parental and caregiver programs.  As part of these programs, all caregivers have flexible paid options to care for the needs of their families.  These benefits are paid at 100 percent salary. For employees pursuing adoption, we offer competitive reimbursement for costs associated with the legal adoption of a child.
 We offer all full-time employees a “Make it Personal” account, which provides $500 annually for certain employee personal expenses including student loan repayment, contributions to college savings plans, donations to charitable organizations, health club memberships or purchases of personal health equipment or home office equipment.  In addition, all employees have access to an annual “Make it Personal” day.  This is an additional 8 hours of paid time off that employees can use to participate in something meaningful or personal to them – from volunteering at a local charity to spending time caring for a loved one.
 We also offer competitive educational benefits for our employees and families. We value and encourage continued growth and development of our employees and their families. To support educational goals, we offer several programs to help offset the financial burden of college expenses, including tuition reimbursement, an executive scholarship award for graduate school and scholarships for dependents of our employees. 
 Our Commitment to Inclusion and Diversity
 We are committed to maintaining a workplace free of discrimination, harassment, intimidation or inappropriate conduct based on sex/gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation and/or any other category protected by law.  We also provide equal opportunity in employment to all employees and applicants.  Equal opportunity rights are applicable to recruitment, hiring, employment and employment-related decisions.  In 2020, we introduced RiSE, a strategic program to further embed inclusion, diversity, equity and allyship into the organization.  Through RiSE, over 20 volunteer employee leaders work together, along with diverse working groups, to enhance and promote our approach to diverse recruitment, professional development, community involvement and building the overall organizational inclusive culture.  
 Our commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity and allyship is evidenced from the top down.  Our CEO, Timothy Walbert, was one of the first signatories to the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge.  Our top leaders have gone through in-depth assessments to determine their inclusive leadership capabilities, with coaching being made available for leaders who want to enhance their skillset.  In 2020, we allocated additional resources and clarified accountability of leaders to focus on enhancing organizational inclusion and diversity, including appointing Irina Konstantinovsky as our Chief Diversity Officer, adding to her responsibilities as our Chief Human Resources Officer. We also assigned a fellow to participate for one year in the CEO Action for Racial Equity initiative, stepping away from her role at Horizon to do work for the betterment of our communities. 
 In 2019, a study conducted by Aon, a leading compensation consulting firm, demonstrated our gender and ethnicity pay equity.  The study analyzed employee demographic and pay data and showed that we provide equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender or ethnicity.  Based on the outputs of the study according to Aon, we ranked in the top five of the approximately 100 companies it had studied in this regard at the time of the study.
