Company Background – Business Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Utah on October 4, 1985, under the name of Mormon Mint, Inc. The corporation was originally a startup company organized to manufacture and market commemorative medallions related to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. On January 5, 1999, Bekam Investments, Ltd. acquired one hundred percent of the common shares of the Company and spun the Company off changing its name Converge Global, Inc. From August 13, 1999 until November 20, 2002, the Company focused on the development and implementation of Internet web content and e-commerce applications. From 2009 to 2014, we operated primarily in the mining exploration business. In 2015, we left the mining business and began an internet-based marketing business focused on offerings from our “Majestic Menu” food service items offered to the hospitality and food service industry via an on-line internet site, where individuals could purchase retail direct from food distributors via credit cards and commercial accounts.

On September 9, 2015, Donald Steinberg was appointed Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company. Mr. Larsen was appointed to the Board of Directors.

The Company reported the change of control in its September 30, 2015 quarterly report filed with the OTC Markets. Thereafter, the Company’s business plans and operations changed to focus on cannabis and legalized hemp more fully discussed in this filing.

Global Hemp Group, Inc. New Brunswick Joint Venture; On September
5, 2017, we announced our agreement to participate in a joint venture with Global Hemp Group Inc., a Canadian corporation, in a
multi-phase industrial hemp project on the Acadian peninsula of New Brunswick, Canada. The joint venture’s goal is to develop
a “Hemp Agro-Industrial Zone”, a concept that promotes and engages farmers, processors and manufacturers to collaboratively
produce and process 100% of the hemp plant into a number of wholesale materials that can be manufactured into healthy and sustainable
products. Our participation included providing one-half, or $10,775 of the funding for the phase one work. On January 10, 2018,
phase-one was completed by successfully harvesting industrial hemp during the 2017 growing season for research purposes. The Company
expected to share in the ownership of research and development of hemp and CBD related studies produced by the New Brunswick Project.
The Company also expected to benefit from the expected change to Canadian laws and regulations governing cultivation and processing
of hemp and hemp-derived CBD products, by acquiring possible preferred pricing and terms for the purchase of hemp and CBD. However,
the 2018 hemp harvest and the extracted CBD was determined to not have sufficient CBD content to be salable. In 2019, Canada released
regulations requiring those cultivating hemp for CBD extraction to obtain individual cannabis licenses, as cannabis was deemed
to have more valuable CBD content than hemp. Canada’s resulting emphasis on cannabis cultivation and the requirement for
individual producers to obtain individual licenses led to termination of phase two of the research project. The Company determined
the New Brunswick joint venture fully impaired in 2018.


Viva Buds Joint Venture with Natural Plant Extracts of California
Inc.; On April 15, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Natural Plant Extracts of California, Inc.
and subsidiaries (“NPE”). The purpose of the joint venture was to utilize NPE’s California and City cannabis
licenses to jointly operate a business named “Viva Buds” to operate a licensed cannabis distribution service in California.
In exchange for acquiring 20% of NPE’s common stock, the Company agree to pay two million dollars and issue NPE one million
dollars’ worth of the Company’s restricted common stock. As of February 3, 2020, the Company was in arrears in its
payment obligations under the joint venture agreement, and the parties entered into a settlement and release of all claims terminating
the joint venture. The parties agreed to reduce the Company’s equity ownership in NPE from 20% to 5%. The Company also agreed
to pay NPE $85,000 and the balance of $56,085.15 paid in a convertible promissory note issued with terms allowing NPE to convert
the note into common stock at a 50% discount to the closing price of MCOA’s common stock as of the maturity date. As of the
date of this filing, the Company satisfied its payment obligations under the settlement agreement. Our continuing 5% equity ownership
in NPE involves related parties, since Edward Manolos, our director, is also a director and beneficial owner of 18.8% of the common
stock in NPE.


Natural Plant Extract of California & Subsidiaries Joint Venture;
On April 15, 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Natural Plant Extracts of California, Inc. and

In exchange for acquiring 20% of Natural Plant Extracts’ common stock, the Company agree to pay two million dollars and
issue Natural Plant Extract one million dollars’ worth of the Company’s restricted common stock. As of February 3,
2020, the Company was in arrears in its payment obligations under the joint venture agreement, and the parties entered into a
settlement and release of all claims terminating the joint venture. The parties agreed to reduce the Company’s equity ownership

paid in a convertible promissory note issued with terms allowing Natural Plant Extracts to convert the note into common stock
at a 50% discount to the closing price of MCOA’s common stock as of the maturity date. As of the date of this filing, the

2. Current Joint Ventures  and Investments.
 

Global Hemp Group Joint Venture/Scio Oregon Hemp Project; On
May 8, 2018, the Company, Global Hemp Group, Inc., a Canadian corporation, and TTO Enterprises, Ltd., an Oregon corporation entered
into a Joint Venture Agreement. The purpose of the joint venture is to develop a project to commercialize the cultivation of industrial
hemp on a 109 acre parcel of real property owned by the Company and Global Hemp Group in Scio, Oregon, and operating under the
Oregon corporation Covered Bridges, Ltd. The joint venture agreement committed the Company to provide cash contributions of $600,000
payable on the following funding schedule: $200,000 upon execution of the joint venture agreement; $238,780 by July 31, 2018; $126,445
by October 31, 2018; and, $34,775 by January 31, 2019. The Company complied with its payments. The 2018 crop of hemp grown on the
joint venture’s real property consisted of 33 acres of high yielding CBD hemp grown in an orchard style cultivation on the
property. The 2018 harvest consisted of approximately 37,000 high yielding CBD hemp plants producing 24 tons of biomass that produced
48,000 pounds of dried biomass. The joint venture partners prepared processing samples ranging in size from 100 lbs. to 2,000 lbs.
for sample offers to extraction companies. However, there were delays with Global Hemp Group’s management and maintenance
of the business and the biomass that caused degradation to the harvested crop affecting marketability. Additional issues and disputes
arose between the Company and Global Hemp Group. These disputes led to the parties entering into a settlement agreement on September
28, 2020, whereby Global Hemp Group agreed to pay the Company $200,000 and issue common stock to the Company equal in value to
$185,000 as of September 28, 2020, subject to a non-dilutive protection provision. Additionally, Global Hemp Group agreed to pay
the Company $10,000 to cover the Company’s legal fees relating to the Agreement. In exchange for the settlement consideration,
the Company agreed to relinquish its ownership interest in the joint venture.

Bougainville Ventures, Inc. Joint Venture; On March 16, 2017,
we entered into a joint venture agreement with Bougainville Ventures, Inc., a Canadian corporation. The purpose of the joint venture
was for the Company and Bougainville to (i) jointly engage in the development and promotion of products in the legalized cannabis
industry in Washington State; (ii) utilize Bougainville's high quality cannabis grow operations in the State of Washington, where
it claimed to have an ownership interest in real property for use within the legalized cannabis industry; (iii) leverage Bougainville’s
agreement with a I502 Tier 3 license holder to grow cannabis on the site; provide technical and management services and resources
including, but not limited to: sales and marketing, agricultural procedures, operations, security and monitoring, processing and
delivery, branding, capital resources and financial management; and, (iv) optimize collaborative business opportunities. The Company
and Bougainville agreed to operate through a Washington State Limited Liability Company, and BV-MCOA Management, LLC was organized
in the State of Washington on May 16, 2017.


As our contribution to the joint venture, the Company committed to raise not less than $1,000,000 to fund joint venture operations, based upon a funding schedule. The Company also committed to providing branding and systems for the representation of cannabis related products and derivatives comprised of management, marketing and various proprietary methodologies directly tailored to the cannabis industry.
 The Company and Bougainville's agreement provided that funding by the Company would pay for the joint venture’s ultimate purchase of the land consisting of a one-acre parcel located in Okanogan County, Washington, for joint venture operations.
 
As disclosed on Form 8-K on December 11, 2017, the Company did not comply with the funding schedule for the joint venture. On November 6, 2017, the Company and Bougainville amended the joint venture agreement to reduce the amount of the Company's commitment from $1,000,000 to $800,000, and also required the Company to issue Bougainville 15 million shares of the Company's restricted common stock. The Company completed its payments pursuant to the amended agreement on November 7, 2017, and on November 9, 2017, issued to Bougainville 15 million shares of restricted common stock. The amended agreement provided that Bougainville would deed the real property to the joint venture within thirty days of its receipt of payment.
 Thereafter, the Company determined that Bougainville had no ownership interest in the property in Washington State, but rather was a party to a purchase agreement for real property that was in breach of contract for non-payment. Bougainville also did not possess an agreement with a Tier 3 I502 license holder to grow Marijuana on the property. Nonetheless, as a result of funding arranged for by the Company, Bougainville and an unrelated third party, Green Ventures Capital Corp., purchased the land, but did not deed the real property to the joint venture. Bougainville failed to pay delinquent property taxes to Okanogan County and to date, the property has not been deeded to the joint venture.
 
To clarify the respective contributions and roles of the parties, the Company offered to enter into good faith negotiations to revise and restate the joint venture agreement with Bougainville. The Company diligently attempted to communicate with Bougainville to accomplish a revised and restated joint venture agreement, and efforts towards satisfying the conditions to complete the subdivision of the land by the Okanogan County Assessor. However, Bougainville failed to cooperate or communicate with the Company in good faith, and failed to pay the delinquent taxes on the real property that would allow for sub-division and the deeding of the real property to the joint venture.

On August 10, 2018, the Company advised its independent auditor that Bougainville did not cooperate or communicate with the Company regarding its requests for information concerning the audit of Bougainville’s receipt and expenditures of $800,000 contributed by the Company in the joint venture agreement. Bougainville had a material obligation to do so under the joint venture agreement. The Company believes that some of the funds it paid to Bougainville were misappropriated and that there was self-dealing with respect to those funds. Additionally, the Company believes that Bougainville misrepresented material facts in the joint venture agreement, as amended, including, but not limited to, Bougainville’s representations that: (i) it had an ownership interest in real property that was to be deeded to the joint venture; (ii) it had an agreement with a Tier 3 # I502 cannabis license holder to grow cannabis on the real property; and, (iii) that clear title to the real property associated with the Tier 3 # I502 license would be deeded to the joint venture thirty days after the Company made its final funding contribution. As a result, on September 20, 2018, the Company filed suit against Bougainville Ventures, Inc., BV-MCOA Management, LLC, Andy Jagpal, Richard Cindric, et al. in Okanogan County Washington Superior Court, case number 18-2- 0045324. The Company’s complaint seeks legal and equitable relief for breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, recession of the joint venture agreement, an accounting, quiet title to real property in the name of the Company, for the appointment of a receiver, the return to treasury of 15 million shares issued to Bougainville, and, for treble damages pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act in Washington State. The registrant has filed a lis pendens on the real property. The case is currently in litigation.
 In connection with the agreement, the Company recorded a cash investment of $1,188,500 to the Joint Venture during 2017. This was comprised of 49.5% ownership of BV-MCOA Management LLC, and was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company recorded an annual impairment in 2017 of $792,500, reflecting the Company’s percentage of ownership of the net book value of the investment. During 2018, the Company recorded equity losses of $37,673 and $11,043 for the first and second quarters respectively, and recorded an annual impairment of $285,986 for the year ended December 31, 2018, at which time the Company determined the investment to be fully impaired due to Bougainville’s breach of contract and resulting litigation, as discussed above.
 

· | Share Exchange with Cannabis Global, Inc. On September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a securities exchange agreement with Cannabis Global, Inc., a Nevada corporation. By virtue of the agreement, the Company issued 650,000,000 shares of its unregistered common stock to Cannabis Global in exchange for 7,222,222 shares of Cannabis Global unregistered common stock. The Company and Cannabis Global also entered into a lock up leak out agreement which prevents either party from sales of the exchanged shares for a period of 12 months.

Recent US Government Decriminalization and Legalization of Hemp
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill.” Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, and hemp derived CBD, were classified as Schedule 1 controlled substances, and so illegal under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 811 (hereafter referred to as the “CSA”). 
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC, the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—illegal under the CSA. 
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.

The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 We currently operate two divisions within the regulated hemp industry: (i) the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of our hempSMART™ consumer products that include non-psychoactive industrial hemp-based CBD as an ingredient; and, (ii) professional financial consulting and property management services.
 
On April 15, 2019, we entered into a joint venture with Natural Plant Extract of California, Inc., and subsidiaries, to operate a licensed psychoactive cannabis distribution service in California, who legalized THC psychoactive cannabis for medicinal and recreational use on January 1, 2018. As disclosed in greater detail below, on February 3, 2020, we terminated the joint venture. As of the date of this filing, we do not conduct any business in the psychoactive cannabis markets in those states that have legalized cannabis for medicinal or recreational use.
 
Brazilian Law Regarding Cannabis and Hemp
 
Brazilian law currently prohibits cannabis cultivation, processing, and sales. This restriction applies to both marijuana and industrial hemp. There is no distinction between hemp and marijuana. As a result, there is no specific legislation on industrial hemp. However, on August 18, 2020, draft legislation was introduced that would allow Brazilian farmers to grow cannabis for medical and industrial purposes on domestic soil for the first time has been submitted to the country’s lower house of Congress. The bill was delivered to the House of Deputies speaker by lawmakers Paulo Teixeira and Luciano Ducci, co-sponsors of the bill who sit on the chamber’s special commission for the regulation of medicinal cannabis. Action is pending on this legislation.

Competition
 
Our competitors include sellers of hemp-based CBD products and professional services firms dedicated to the regulated hemp industry. We compete in markets where hemp has been legalized and regulated, which includes the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Our marketing efforts in Brazil and Uruguay are in the development stages. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the global industry matures. Additionally, increased competition worldwide is possible to the extent that new states, jurisdictions and countries enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes that de-criminalize and regulate hemp products, including the 2018 Farm Bill. We believe that by being well established in the industry, along with our experience, and our continued expansion of service and product offerings in new and existing locations, are factors that mitigate the risks associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our expected operations and results.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 4 full-time employees.
