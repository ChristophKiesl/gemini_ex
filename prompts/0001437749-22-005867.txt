Overview 
 
Bsquare develops and deploys technologies for the makers and operators of connected devices. These fleets of business-oriented devices, often called the Internet of Things (IoT), offer a powerful means to connect organizations, people, information, and ideas. Hundreds of millions of connected devices have already been deployed and it is estimated that billions more will be. Despite their growing prevalence, these devices and the systems in which they operate remain a significant source of complexity, unplanned and often uncontrolled expense, and operational risk. Our customers are undergoing a massive change in their business practices and Bsquare provides technology that helps them capture the value of connected devices and reduces the cost and risk of doing so.
 
Since our founding in 1994, Bsquare has helped embedded device manufacturers (“Original Equipment Manufacturers” or “OEMs”) design and build cost-effective products. For most of our history, we operated at the intersection of hardware and software, helping our customers select, develop, and configure system software for a variety of purpose-built devices, from mobile computing to point-of-sale systems to healthcare equipment to hospitality, gaming, and more. Our expertise in hardware, device configuration, and operating systems became essential to our customers’ design cycles and purchasing decisions. As our customers deployed ever-larger fleets of devices, our understanding of the requirements for large-scale device operations increased.
 
More recently, our expertise and business prospects have shifted to cloud-connected devices that have been connected to create intelligent systems. This shift coincides with the overall growth of IoT technologies and with our customers’ recognition that connected intelligent devices create significant business opportunities. Device makers have increasingly specified their products not only to be connection-ready, but also to be enhanced by the breadth and depth of functionality that connection creates. We have taken to market a valuable and expanding portfolio of products and services that meet the needs of connected device makers. This portfolio captures our experience and our expertise can enable our customers to be more productive, flexible, and financially successful. And, in turn, our customers can then help make people and organizations more productive, improve quality of life, and reduce demands on the limited resources of our planet.
 
Embedded Operating System Software and Services
 
Customers frequently engage us because of our technical expertise in device operating system (“OS”) image development and configuration, device software development and testing, and our experience in embedded and mobile systems design. Our long and successful history as a Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) embedded OS distribution and technology partner is a source of many customer opportunities and a pillar of our reputation in the IoT ecosystem. We believe working with Bsquare engineers can result in shorter development cycles, faster time-to-market, lower overall development costs, and a more robust product. Our software and configuration services are designed to help ensure that our customers’ devices are secure, updateable, and operable as part of a connected IoT system. A decade ago, our customers typically built devices on a single OS. Today, they increasingly have a multi-OS product strategy. Accordingly, we believe that the need for our embedded OS expertise and services is expanding and accelerating. We recognize revenue and cost of sales for this segment of our business under the name “Partner Solutions”.
 
Our target market for OS software and services includes makers of connected, intelligent devices such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, smart vending machines, ATMs, essential equipment in buildings and facilities environments, digital signs, and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. These devices work on a variety of operating systems, including the most common: Windows IoT, Android, and Linux. They are deployed in various cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), or Google Cloud, and are typically connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers for these smart devices include world-class OEMs, original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), silicon vendors, and peripheral vendors.
 
IoT Operations Services and Software
 
Our customers’ devices are frequently components of complicated operating networks, creating new requirements for updating, maintaining, and evolving the capabilities of devices in the fleet. Once configured and deployed, this device fleet then becomes part of an operational environment that requires long-term attention to the challenges of IoT operations. These demands have created operational burdens that are difficult to meet through traditional technologies and support models. For that reason, our customers are increasingly relying on Bsquare’s extensive experience developing, deploying, and operating large IoT systems at scale. Our experience using Microsoft Azure and AWS cloud services is an asset we believe to be seldom found inside a customer’s technology team. Outsourcing fleet management and 24/7 operations services to Bsquare can result in lower system development costs, greater security, better maintainability, lower operating costs, and improved return on investment (“ROI”) for a customer’s IoT system. We have built and now operate 24/7 mission critical IoT systems for customers of varying size and complexity, and we believe the software and processes we have used to do so may be a sustainable competitive advantage and a potential opportunity for new revenue. We recognize revenue and cost of sales for this segment of our business under the name “Edge to Cloud”.
 
Our target market for our IoT operations service and software includes our OS and software OEM customers as well as companies that purchase from those OEMs and operate their devices as a fleet. This market represents business and industrial segments in a wide range of vertical markets such as retail, point of sale, medical equipment, gaming, buildings and facilities management, manufacturing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, utility management, and transportation. The IoT market continues to evolve as companies understand the possibilities and economics of IoT technology and operations. Increasingly, customers are realizing that IoT operations are not core competencies of their business and that outsourcing operations can lower costs, reduce downtime, and mitigate the reputational risk of security and operational failures.

Competition
 
Microsoft controls who can distribute its OS software. Microsoft Authorized Distributors that we compete with include Advantech, Inc., Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc., and Dell Computer, Inc. Our competition is not limited to these Microsoft Authorized Distributors. We compete with other consulting firms for services related to device design and development, system software development, and engineering firms that offer similar services.
 
Despite competition from these larger organizations, we have retained a loyal customer base, largely due to our technical support and business services. We are known as the company that can manage difficult problems at the intersection of hardware and software.  Our competitors have directed customers to us to resolve issues and Microsoft’s OS team regularly seeks our guidance on customer technical challenges. Further, as a software-only company with multi-OS experience, we have always offered customers independence from OS or hardware biases.
 
Our history provides us with a unique position in the market. Our legacy OS distribution, our reputation as a technology provider, and our recent experience building and operating significant IoT systems sets us apart. These factors enable and enhance the market credibility of our claims of expertise, experience, and insight. As our customers evaluate products and services for purchasing decisions, we believe that they are and will remain more likely to buy from a company that has the history and experience to meet their requirements and provide a long-term operational perspective.
 
Our product portfolio is composed of solutions that are highly complementary across our customers’ product lifecycles. Supplying a customer with Device Hardening and OS licensing put us in a unique position to sell SquareOne. Similarly, if a customer selects our SquareOne product, the first implementation consideration is the configuration of the software on the devices, creating an opportunity for our Device Hardening solution and operating system license sales.
 
The market for device software and engineering services is competitive and we face competition from the following:
 

● | Our current and potential customers’ internal engineering and research and development departments, which may seek to provide their own IoT-related services or develop their own software solutions which could compete with our own service offerings and products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engineering service firms, including offshore development companies, such as Adeneo, Symphony Teleca, and Wipro.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Large, established enterprise software and solution providers such as International Business Machines, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE, and SAS Software, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cloud IoT providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including PTC Inc. and TTTech Industrial North America, Inc.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Startups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3.AI, Inc., Losant IOT Inc., and TeamViewer US, Inc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing 
 
We market our products and services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents, or other indirect channels. Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, digital marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs, and a comprehensive website.
 
Our sales and marketing efforts with embedded OS customers will also be beneficial in our efforts to attract customers for our IoT software and services, and vice versa. The two markets we have traditionally served are converging, and our sales and marketing will increasingly reflect that convergence. The cross-selling opportunities between our two primarily markets could be a source of strength as we continue to expand our presence and reputation among the makers of IoT devices and those responsible for IoT device operations.

International Operations 
 
Our international operations outside of North America are conducted through our offices in Trowbridge, UK. We maintain a European sales and marketing presence through the UK office exclusively in support of our IoT software and services, reported in our Edge to Cloud business segment. The majority of our global technical personnel also work from the UK office. 
 
Our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows IoT operating systems is currently restricted to North America. As a result, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. Revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was approximately 14% of total revenue in both 2021 and 2020.
 
Human Capital 
 
We had a total employee headcount of 53 on December 31, 2021, with 33 people located in North America and 20 in the United Kingdom. As compared to December 31, 2020, our total employee headcount was smaller by seven.
 
In response to ongoing orders by local governments to “stay at home,” “shelter-in-place” and similar actions intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we closed our offices in Trowbridge in the United Kingdom and stopped all non-essential activities in our Seattle, Washington office. Bsquare’s operations are, at the time of this filing, largely virtual. We will continue to monitor local regulations and may adjust our policies and work-from-home mandates and conditions as requirements change.
 
In the second quarter of 2020, we moved our corporate headquarters from Bellevue, Washington, to Seattle, Washington. From the outset, we conceived of our new location as a collaboration space and its design was based on a review of how and where we collaborate, our teams’ commuting patterns, facilities costs, and our long-term space requirements. With our engineering team in the UK and customers all over the globe, collaborating over long distances and time zones was an operating imperative. We purchased and deployed technologies that enabled and enhanced remote work and as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 asked our team members to begin to consider how they could begin to work more often from remote locations. This planning work allowed us to move seamlessly to virtual operations when the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. While the new Seattle facility remained largely unoccupied throughout 2021, we believe it will serve us well and we look forward to hosting visitors when it is safe again.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We operate a standing Anti-racism and Inclusion Task Force to help us reckon with the ways in which our company and the technology industry at large have contributed to systemic racism and the marginalization of underrepresented and underserved groups in both the US and the UK. In this area, we favor action over performative speech. We are expanding our recruiting outreach to find candidates from communities currently underrepresented in technology companies and are renewing our commitment to inclusive hiring practices. We are particularly interested in building a team composed of people who have made diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace a central part of their professional journey. We are also holding our partners accountable to their own actions in pursuit of racial equity, and we are offering every employee a day of Community Engagement Leave to vote, volunteer in their community, or participate in other civic activities.
Compensation and Benefits
 
We strive to provide market-competitive compensation and benefits that attract and retain employees whose values align with our mission and goals. Our compensation packages include combinations of competitive base pay, sales commissions, performance based short-term incentives, health care, retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave. In addition, we offer employees the benefit of equity ownership in the Company through stock option grants. We also provide access to a variety of health and wellness resources.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 
 
We strive to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, through contractual arrangements, and occasionally through patent filings. While we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us, we plan to continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
 
Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property.
 
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
