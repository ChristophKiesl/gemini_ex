Item 1. Business.
Introduction
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. We have reviewed a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
Our executive offices are located at 245 Park Avenue, 44th Floor, New York, New York 10167, and our telephone number is (212) 750-7300. Our corporate website address is https://www.aresacquisitioncorporation.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.
Company History
In January 2020, the Company was formed by Ares Acquisition Holdings L.P. (our “Sponsor”). As of February 21, 2023, our Sponsor owned 24,850,000 of the 25,000,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding.
On February 4, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 100,000,000 units (the “Units”), including 13,000,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the “Over-Allotment Units”). The Units sold in the Initial Public Offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $1.0 billion, and incurring offering costs of approximately $55.9 million, of which $35.0 million was for deferred underwriting commissions. Each Unit consists of one of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
Simultaneous with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 15,333,333 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares for $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants”), to our Sponsor at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $23.0 million. Of the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, $1.0 billion was placed in a Trust Account. Each whole Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
Beginning March 25, 2021, holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “AAC.U” and the Class A ordinary shares and warrants that are separated trade under the symbols “AAC” and “AAC WS,” respectively.
Proposed Business Combination
On December 5, 2022 (the “Signing Date”), the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms, the “Business Combination Agreement”), among the Company, X-energy and, solely for purposes of Section 1.01(f), Section 6.25 and Article IX of the Business Combination Agreement, each of The Kamal S. Ghaffarian Revocable Trust (the “Trust”), IBX Company Opportunity 
Fund 1, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“IBX Fund 1”), IBX Company Opportunity Fund 2, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“IBX Fund 2”), IBX Opportunity GP, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“IBX GP”), GM Enterprises LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“GM Enterprises” and, together with the Trust, IBX Fund 1, IBX Fund 2, IBX GP and GM Enterprises, each, a “Series A Party” and collectively, the “Series A Parties”), and X-Energy Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Management LLC”). The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to as the “Business Combination.” The Company and X-energy are individually referred to as a “Party” and, collectively, the “Parties.”
Following the time of the closing (the “Closing,” and the date on which the Closing occurs, the “Closing Date”) of the Business Combination, the combined company will be organized in an umbrella partnership C corporation structure, in which substantially all of the assets and the business of the combined company will be held by X-energy. The combined company’s business will continue to operate through X-energy and its subsidiaries. In connection with the Closing, the Company will change its name to “X-Energy, Inc.” (such company after the Closing, “New X-energy”).
The Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination were approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company (including, in the case of the Company, the special committee of the board of directors, which consists of its independent directors, (the “Special Committee”)) and X-energy.
The Business Combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, following the receipt of the required approval by the Company’s shareholders and the fulfillment of other customary closing conditions. For further details on the Business Combination, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with SEC on December 6, 2022.
The Domestication
The Company will, subject to obtaining the required shareholder approvals and at least one day prior to the Closing Date, deregister as a Cayman Islands exempted company and transfer by way of continuation to and domesticate as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”).
Immediately prior to the Domestication, each of the then issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (each, a “Cayman Class B Share”), will convert automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (each, a “Cayman Class A Share”) (the “Sponsor Share Conversion”). In connection with the Domestication: (i) each of the then issued and outstanding Cayman Class A Shares will convert automatically, on a one-for-one basis, into a share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (after the Domestication) (the “New X-energy Class A Common Stock”); (ii) each of the then issued and outstanding warrants representing the right to purchase one Cayman Class A Share will convert automatically into a warrant to acquire one share of New X-energy Class A Common Stock pursuant to the related warrant agreement (each warrant, a “New X-energy Warrant”); and (iii) each of the then issued and outstanding units of the Company will be canceled and each holder will be entitled to one share of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and one-fifth of one New X-energy Warrant.
The Recapitalization
Immediately prior to the Closing, X-energy will effectuate a recapitalization (the “Recapitalization”) whereby all outstanding equity securities of X-energy will be converted or exchanged into common units (each, an “X-energy Common Unit” and collectively, the “X-energy Common Units”) and unvested earn out units (each, an “Earn Out Unit” and collectively, the “Earn Out Units”), as applicable.
The Business Combination and Consideration
In connection with the Closing:
 (i)    X-energy and the Company will enter into an amended and restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of X-energy (the “A&R Operating Agreement”), to, among other things, permit the issuance and ownership of the post-Recapitalization equity of X-energy as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and to admit the Company as the managing member of X-energy; and
 (ii)    The Company will file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “A&R Charter”). The A&R Charter will, among other things, set forth the rights and preferences of the equity interests of New X-energy. In particular, the A&R Charter will provide that (a) each share of New X-energy Class A Common Stock will have one vote per share and economic rights, (b) each share of Class B common stock of 
New X-energy, par value $0.0001 per share (“New X-energy Class B Common Stock”), will have one vote per share and no economic rights, (c) each share of Class C common stock of New X-energy, par value $0.0001 per share (“New X-energy Class C Common Stock”), will have ten votes per share and no economic rights and (d) each share of Class D common stock of New X-energy, par value of $0.0001 per share (“New X-energy Class D Common Stock”), will have ten votes per share and economic rights.
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, New X-energy will issue or cause to be issued to: (i) each member of X-energy (each, a “Member” and collectively, the “Members”), a number of shares of New X-energy Class B Common Stock or New X-energy Class C Common Stock, as applicable, in each case, equal to the number of X-energy Common Units held by such Member as of and on the Closing Date, in exchange for the payment of adequate consideration (in each case, not to exceed a per-share price equal to the par value per share of the New X-energy Class B Common Stock or New X-energy Class C Common Stock, as applicable) (the “X-energy Equity Holders Subscription Amount”), pursuant to individual subscription agreements to be entered into between each X-energy equityholder and New X-energy; (ii) Management LLC, a number of shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and Unvested Earn Out Shares (as defined below) to be issued pursuant to a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”); and (iii) each Series A Party, a number of shares of New X-energy Class D Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Contribution Agreement.
The aggregate consideration to be received in respect of the Business Combination by the Members and any other holders of equity securities of X-energy (excluding the holders of any equity securities that by their terms will not convert into X-energy Common Units at or prior to the Closing) shall be equal to the Aggregate Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), the Earn Out Units and, following consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement (including the contribution of an equal number of Earn Out Units to the Company), the shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock issued to Management LLC pursuant to the Contribution Agreement that will, following issuance, be subject to vesting and potential forfeiture on the same terms as the Sponsor Earn Out Securities (as defined below) (the “Unvested Earn Out Shares”).
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will contribute to X-energy an amount in cash (the “Available Closing Cash”) equal to, as of immediately prior to the Closing, the sum of (without duplication): (i) all amounts in the Trust Account, less (a) amounts required for the redemptions of Cayman Class A Shares by the Company’s current shareholders and (b) transaction expenses of X-energy and the Company, plus (ii) the aggregate proceeds, if any, actually received by the Company or New X-energy from the sale of shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock, one or more series of preferred stock, or convertible debt securities in a private placement consummated prior to or substantially concurrently with the Closing (the “PIPE Investment”), plus (iii) all other cash and cash equivalents of the Company, determined in accordance with GAAP as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, plus (iv) the aggregate X-energy Equity Holders Subscription Amount in exchange for: (x) a number of X-energy Common Units equal to the number of shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and New X-energy Class D Common Stock outstanding as of the Closing; (y) a number of warrants of X-energy (the “X-energy Warrants”) equal to the number of New X-energy Warrants outstanding as of the Closing; and (z) if applicable, a number of securities issued by X-energy to the Company having terms and provisions substantially similar to the terms and provisions of any equity or equity-linked securities (other than New X-energy Class A Common Stock) that are issued by the Company at the Closing in connection with the PIPE Investment (the “Alternative Financing Securities”) equal to the number of corresponding Alternative Financing Securities outstanding as of the Closing.
Member Earn-Out 
As part of the Recapitalization, up to 25,000,000 Earn Out Units will be subject to vesting at the Closing and will be earned, released and delivered upon satisfaction of the following milestones: (i) 12,500,000 Earn Out Units will vest to the Members and, solely with respect to the Earn Out Units held by the Company following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Company, if, during the Earn Out Period (as defined below), the volume weighted average closing sale price of New X-energy Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for a period of at least twenty days out of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of determination (“Triggering Event I”); and (ii) 12,500,000 Earn Out Units will vest to the Members and, solely with respect to the Earn Out Units held by the Company following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Company, if, during the Earn Out Period, the volume weighted average closing sale price of New X-energy Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for a period of at least twenty days out of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of determination (“Triggering Event II”).
If, following the Closing Date and prior to the third anniversary of the Closing, there is a Change of Control (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), then Triggering Event I and Triggering Event II shall be deemed to occur and 
the Earn Out Units shall vest to the Members and, solely with respect to the Earn Out Units held by the Company following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Company. If a Change of Control occurs following the third anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the expiration of the Earn Out Period that results in the holders of New X-energy Class A Common Stock receiving a per share price greater than or equal to $12.50 or $15.00, respectively, then immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event I or Triggering Event II, as applicable, will be deemed to have occurred and the Earn Out Units shall vest to the Members and, solely with respect to the Earn Out Units held by the Company following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the Company.
Upon the vesting of any Earn Out Units, each of the applicable Members will be issued an equal number of shares of New X-energy Class B Common Stock or New X-energy Class C Common Stock, as applicable, in exchange for the payment to New X-energy of adequate consideration (in each case, not to exceed a per-share price equal to the par value per share of such New X-energy Class B Common Stock or New X-energy Class C Common Stock, as applicable).
The “Earn Out Period” means the time period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date (inclusive of the first and last day of such period).
Sponsor Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) with X-energy, our Sponsor and each of the Company’s independent directors (the “Company Independent Directors,” collectively with the Sponsor, the “Purchaser Support Parties,” and each, a “Purchaser Support Party”), pursuant to which the Purchaser Support Parties agreed to, among other things: (i) vote in favor of adoption of the Transaction Proposals; (ii) vote against any Alternative Transaction (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and any merger agreement or merger other than the Transaction Proposals, the Business Combination Agreement and the Business Combination; (iii) vote against any change in the business, management or board of directors of the Company (other than in connection with the Transaction Proposals or pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement or ancillary agreements); and (iv) vote against any proposal, action or agreement that would: (a) impede, interfere, frustrate, prevent or nullify any provision of the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement or the Business Combination; (b) result in a breach in any respect of any covenant, representation, warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Business Combination Agreement; (c) result in any of the closing conditions of the Business Combination Agreement not being fulfilled; (d) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Purchaser Support Party in the Sponsor Support Agreement; or (e) change in any manner the dividend policy or capitalization of, including the voting rights of any class of capital stock of, the Company. Each officer and director of the Company previously entered into a letter agreement with the Company in connection with the Company’s Initial Public Offering, pursuant to which they agreed to vote any the Company ordinary shares held by them in favor of the Business Combination. If at any time following the Signing Date and until the termination of the Business Combination Agreement, the board of directors of the Company or the Special Committee effects a Modification in Recommendation, then the obligations to vote or consent in accordance with the foregoing clauses (i)-(iv), (x) with respect to the Purchaser Support Parties other than the Sponsor, shall cease to apply and each of the Company’s independent directors shall be expressly permitted to vote or provide consent in respect of their respective Company ordinary shares in their sole discretion and (y) with respect to the Sponsor, shall automatically be deemed to be modified such that the Sponsor will vote or provide its consent with respect to its Cayman Class B shares in the same proportion to the votes cast or consent provided, as applicable, of the Company’s public shareholders.
Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, until the earliest of the Closing, termination of the Business Combination Agreement and the liquidation of X-energy, no Purchaser Support Party shall (subject to limited and customary exceptions), without the prior written consent of X-energy: (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate or pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Cayman Class B Shares or Cayman Purchaser Warrants (together, the “Sponsor Subject Securities”); (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Sponsor Subject Securities; (iii) take any action in furtherance of any of the matters described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii); or (iv) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii).
Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, each Purchaser Support Party agreed to waive, subject to the consummation of the Business Combination, all anti-dilution rights with respect to the rate that the Cayman Class B Shares convert into the Cayman Class A Shares in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.
In addition, pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, a certain number of each Purchaser Support Party’s respective pro rata share of the Sponsor Subject Securities shall be surrendered to the Company for cancellation. During the 
Earn Out Period, fifty percent (50%) of the remaining (i) shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company following the Domestication (the “Domesticated the Company Class A Common Stock”) and (ii) warrants to acquire one share of Domesticated the Company Class A Common Stock (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Sponsor Earn Out Securities”) held by the Purchaser Support Parties will vest as follows: (a) upon the occurrence of Triggering Event I, fifty percent (50%) of the Sponsor Earn Out Securities will vest to the Purchaser Support Parties in accordance with each Purchaser Support Party’s respective pro rata share; and (b) upon the occurrence of Triggering Event II, fifty percent (50%) of the Sponsor Earn Out Securities will vest to the Purchaser Support Parties in accordance with each Purchaser Support Party’s respective pro rata share. If, following the Closing and prior to the third anniversary of the Closing, there is a Change of Control, Triggering Event I and Triggering Event II shall be deemed to occur and the Sponsor Earn Out Securities shall vest. If a Change of Control occurs following the third anniversary of the Closing and prior to the expiration of the Earn Out Period that results in the holders of New X-energy Class A Common Stock receiving a per share price greater than or equal to $12.50 or $15.00, respectively, then immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control, Triggering Event I or Triggering Event II, as applicable, will be deemed to have occurred and the Sponsor Earn Out Securities shall vest. The per share price received by the holders of New X-energy Class A Common Stock shall be based on the value of the cash, securities or in-kind consideration being delivered in respect of such New X-energy Class A Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the New X-energy Board. Such per share price shall be adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into New X-energy Class A Common Stock, extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change or transaction with respect to New X-energy Class A Common Stock occurring on or after the Closing.

Subject to the terms of the Company’s organizational documents, the A&R Charter and the bylaws of New X-energy upon Domestication, the Company and X-energy shall take all such action within their power as may be necessary or appropriate such that immediately following the Closing Date, the New X-energy Board shall initially include such director nominees to be designated by X-energy pursuant to written notice to be delivered to X-energy as soon as reasonably practicable following the Signing Date, in each case, subject to X-energy’s obligations under the definitive documentation with respect to the issuance and sale of X-energy’s Series C-2 Convertible/Exchangeable Promissory Notes pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated on or about the Signing Date, by and among X-energy and the investors party to such agreement (the “Funded Permitted Financing”).

In connection with the foregoing, the Company, through its board of directors and the Special Committee, shall recommend to the Company’s shareholders the approval of the Transaction Proposals (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, but not after, receipt of the approval of the Transaction Proposals by the Company’s shareholders, the board of directors of the Company and the Special Committee may withdraw, amend, qualify or modify its recommendation to the Company’s shareholders that they vote in favor of the Transaction Proposals (a “Modification in Recommendation”), if they shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with their outside legal advisors and financial advisors, that the failure to make a Modification in Recommendation would be a breach of their fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Company’s obligations to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an extraordinary general meeting of the Company’s shareholders shall not be affected by any Modification in Recommendation.

indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to: (a) any shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock; or (b) any securities convertible into, or exercisable, redeemable or exchangeable for, New X-energy Class A Common Stock held by such holder immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination (the shares of New X-energy Class A Common Stock and securities specified in clauses (a) and (b), collectively, the “Lock-Up Shares”); (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Lock-Up Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities in cash or otherwise; (iii) take any action in furtherance of any of the matters described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii); or (iv) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii). The X-energy Lock-Up Agreement provides for certain customary permitted transfers, including but not limited to, transfers to certain affiliates or family members and the exercise of certain stock options and warrants.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
At the Closing, the Company, the Sponsor and certain securityholders of X-energy will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Sponsor and such other securityholders will be granted certain customary registration rights, on the terms and subject to the conditions in the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, with respect to securities of New X-energy that they will hold following the Business Combination.
Commitment Letter
On December 5, 2022, the Company and X-energy entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with AAC Holdings II LP (the “Investor”), an affiliate of Ares. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and the summary of terms attached to the Commitment Letter, pursuant to which among other things, the Investor has committed that it or its affiliated vehicles or designees will purchase in a private placement, to close immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, 45,000 shares of Series A preferred stock of the Company (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) at a purchase price of $1,000.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of up to $45.0 million (the “PIPE Commitment”) as such amounts may be reduced as described below.
The PIPE Commitment will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount by which (i) the sum of (a) the amount of cash available in the Trust Account immediately prior to the Closing, less amounts required for any redemptions of Class A common stock by the Company’s public shareholders in connection with the vote to approve the Business Combination (any such redemptions, the “Redemptions”) (to the extent not already paid); plus (b) the aggregate proceeds, if any, actually received by the Company from the PIPE Investment (including any amount actually funded pursuant to the Commitment Letter); plus (c) the aggregate amount actually funded to X-energy in connection with any Permitted Financing (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) prior to January 15, 2023, exceeds (ii) $400.0 million. Any such reduction in the PIPE Commitment shall be applied to reduce the Investor’s obligation under the Commitment Letter. In no event shall any reduction to the PIPE Commitment exceed $25.0 million in the aggregate. X-energy and the Investor may also mutually agree to reduce the amount of the PIPE Commitment.
If the Company enters into subscription or similar agreements with one or more unaffiliated third-party investors (the “Other Investors”) pursuant to which the Other Investors agree to purchase from the Company shares of Class A common stock, shares of one or more series of preferred stock, or convertible debt securities or any other security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for equity securities the Company (such securities, the “Alternative Securities”) substantially concurrently with the Closing, then the obligations of the Investor under the PIPE Commitment will be null and void. In such event, the Investor will enter into a subscription or similar agreement on the same terms and conditions as the Other Investors to purchase Alternative Securities having an aggregate purchase price of $45,000,000, subject to cutbacks based on the formula in the Commitment Letter.
An affiliate of Ares (the “Guarantor”) has provided X-energy with a limited guaranty in favor of X-energy, dated December 5, 2022, with respect to certain of the Investor’s obligations under the Commitment Letter.
Extension
The Company’s Initial Public Offering prospectus and amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provided that the Company had until February 4, 2023 (the date which was 24 months after the consummation of the Initial Public Offering) to complete an initial business combination. As stated in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with SEC on February 3, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of shareholders and approved a proposal to amend the Company’s 
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate an initial business combination from February 4, 2023 to August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as its board of directors may determine in its sole discretion (the “Extension”). In connection with the approval of the Extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 53,002,919 ordinary shares, of which the Company paid cash from the Trust Account in the aggregate amount of approximately $539.0 million (approximately $10.17 per share) to redeeming shareholders.
Extension Promissory Note
On January 26, 2023, our Sponsor agreed to make monthly deposits directly to the Trust Account of $0.03 for each outstanding Class A ordinary share, up to a maximum of $1.2 million per month (each deposit, a “Contribution”) following the approval and implementation of the Extension. Such Contributions will be made pursuant to a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note (the “Extension Promissory Note”) issued by us to our Sponsor. Such Contributions, which will be paid monthly (or a pro rata portion thereof if less than a full month), began on February 3, 2023, and thereafter on the first day of each month (or if such first day is not a business day, on the business day immediately preceding such first day) until the earlier of (i) the consummation of a business combination, and (ii) August 4, 2023 (or any earlier date of termination, dissolution or winding up of the Company in accordance with our memorandum and articles of association or as otherwise determined in the sole discretion of our board of directors) (the earlier of (i) and (ii), the “Maturity Date”). The Extension Promissory Note does not bear any interest, and is repayable by us to our Sponsor upon the Maturity Date. The Maturity Date may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default. Any outstanding principal under the Extension Promissory Note may be prepaid at any time by us, at our election and without penalty.
Business Acquisition Criteria
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, further accelerate the growth of a company in the public markets.
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination, including X-energy. We will leverage these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but to the extent our proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated and we search for other acquisition opportunities, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe have the following core attributes:
• a differentiated and sustainable business model with a defensible market position;
• strong people, processes and culture;
• attractive growth prospects, including an ability to capitalize on positive secular tailwinds;
• a strong customer base;
• sufficient scale and resources to achieve a successful transition into the public market;
• will benefit from having a public currency to enhance its ability to grow organically or through M&A; and
• will benefit from Ares’ relationships and deep value creation capabilities.
We may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry. 
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. As a result of changes in the market since our Initial Public Offering, we may consider a target business in the fossil fuel industry, including the upstream, midstream and energy services sub-sectors. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our directors and executive officers may deem relevant. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating opportunities such as our proposed Business Combination with X-energy, in the event that we do not consummate the proposed Business Combination with X-energy and decide to enter into our initial business combination with another target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination. These communications would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
Our Acquisition Process
The Ares investment process leverages the power of the Ares platform and an extensive network of professionals across investment areas to identify and source attractive risk adjusted return opportunities while emphasizing capital preservation. Ares utilizes its collective market and company knowledge, proprietary internal industry and company research, third party information and financial modeling to drive fundamental analysis and investment selection. Ares also recognizes the importance of considering environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors in its investment process and has adopted an ESG policy for the conduct of its business. Ares works collaboratively with its various underwriting, asset management, legal and compliance teams to appropriately integrate relevant ESG considerations into its investment process.
At the center of Ares’ investment process is a systematic approach that emphasizes rigorous due diligence at the company and market level in addition to a risk-adjusted return value assessment. This investment process is comprised of five stages: (i) generate a robust pipeline, (ii) perform initial screening, (iii) conduct due diligence, (iv) drive transaction structuring, funding and overall execution, and (v) use a systematic approach to value creation. We will benefit from the same approach as we pursue our initial business combination.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review that may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial, operational, legal and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Ares, our Sponsor, or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Ares, our Sponsor, or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm.
Our directors and executive officers may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares or Private Placement Warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
Initial Business Combination
The rules of the NYSE require that we must consummate our initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, or if we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. We also will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. Subject to these limitations, our directors and executive officers will have virtually unlimited flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of X-energy was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the Trust Account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.
If we do not consummate the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, we may also pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with Ares, one or more parties affiliated with Ares, including without limitation, officers and affiliates of Ares, or Ares funds, or investors in such Ares funds. Any such party may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such parties a class of equity or debt securities. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such joint acquisition or specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or 
acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons. We will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (collectively, the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on the relative valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired will be valued for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that is financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our directors and executive officers will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will fully ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, will not be currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Other Considerations
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Ares or any of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with Ares, our Sponsor or any of our executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Ares manages multiple investment vehicles, and expects to raise additional funds or accounts in the future, including during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. These Ares investment entities are expected to be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financings. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity.
In addition, certain of our directors and executive officers currently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, Ares and the Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies. These funds may have overlapping investment objectives and potential conflicts may arise with respect to Ares’ decision regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among these funds. If any of our directors and executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for a fund or entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such fund or entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If Ares, the Ares funds or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to Ares or our directors and executive officers may be suitable for both us and Ares, a current or future Ares fund or one or more of their portfolio companies and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties or contractual obligations, will first be directed to Ares, such fund, investment vehicle or portfolio company before being directed, if at all, to us. However, we do not expect these fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and 
restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may involve another Ares entity) for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. Accordingly, none of Ares or our directors or officers will have obligations to present a business combination opportunity to us.
Our directors and officers or Ares or its affiliates, including the Ares funds, may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates and the director and officer teams. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
In addition, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Moreover, our officers and directors are and in the future will be required to commit time and attention to Ares and current and future Ares funds. To the extent any conflict of interest arises between, on the one hand, us and, on the other hand, any of such entities (including, without limitation, arising as a result of certain of officers and directors being required to offer acquisition opportunities to such entities), Ares and its affiliated funds will resolve such conflicts of interest in their sole discretion in accordance with their then existing fiduciary, contractual and other duties and there can be no assurance that such conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer X-energy, and if the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, any other target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their ordinary shares in the target business for Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once the proposed Business Combination is completed, X-energy or if the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, any other target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe such business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its equity as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
Financial Position
With a Trust Account in the amount of approximately $1,013.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $446.4 million as of February 21, 2023, after taking into account redemptions in connection with the Extension, the expenses of the Initial Public Offering and $35.0 million of deferred underwriting commissions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our proposed Business Combination with X-energy using the sources discussed under “—Proposed Business Combination.” If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we intend to effectuate another initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. For more information on the financing arrangements related to the Business Combination, please see the description of the Business Combination Agreement and the Commitment Letter under “—Proposed Business Combination” of this item.
Sources of Target Businesses
Our process of identifying acquisition targets leverages Ares Management’s and our directors and executive officers’ industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships in numerous industries, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network of Ares and our directors and executive officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants and private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this annual report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors.
We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, including one of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering or one of their respective affiliates, or other individuals, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In addition, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering may provide these services without additional compensation. We will formally engage a finder only to the extent our directors and executive officers determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our directors and executive officers determine is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the Trust Account. In no event, however, will our Sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any 
entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We pay our Sponsor a total of $16,667 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support and our Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing the initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of a target business.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Certain of our directors and executive officers currently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, Ares Management and the Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies. These funds may have overlapping investment objectives and potential conflicts may arise with respect to Ares Management’s decision regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among these funds. If any of our directors and executive officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for a fund or entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any Ares funds or their current or former portfolio companies), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such fund or entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If Ares Management, the Ares funds or other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to Ares Management or our directors and executive officers may be suitable for both us and Ares Management, a current or future Ares fund or one or more of their portfolio companies and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties or contractual obligations, will first be directed to Ares Management, such fund, investment vehicle or portfolio company before being directed, if at all, to us. None of Ares Management or any of our directors and executive officers who are also employed by Ares Management or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware in their capacities as employees of Ares Management, its funds or their portfolio companies. However, we do not expect these duties or contractual obligations to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity (including with respect to any business transaction that may involve another Ares entity) for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to our directors and executive officers, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete 
business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
•subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
•cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of X-energy, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our directors and executive officers, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of our directors and executive officers will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including our proposed Business Combination with X-energy, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our directors and executive officers will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
If the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated, we may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote in connection with another initial business combination, pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
Under the NYSE listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
•we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
•any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or
•the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
•the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
•the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
•the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
•other time and budget constraints of the company; and
•additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
We expect to seek shareholder approval of our proposed Business Combination with X-energy. In the event that the proposed Business Combination with X-energy is not consummated and we conduct redemptions in connection with another initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to have their shares redeemed. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to have their shares redeemed for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Amendments to Facilitate the Consummation of an Initial Business Combination
On February 2, 2023, we held a special meeting of shareholders and approved two proposals to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that will facilitate the consummation of the proposed Business Combination or another initial business combination. The first amendment extended the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination from February 4, 2023 to August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion. The second amendment (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment”) eliminated from the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association a limitation that we shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares to the extent that such redemption would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation”). The Redemption Limitation Amendment enables us to redeem public shares irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the limitation.

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then- outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share (plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly elect to redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself before we can validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our Sponsor and each of our directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class B ordinary shares and any public shares in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules.
If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
•conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
•file proxy materials with the SEC.
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting. In such case, our Sponsor has agreed to vote its Class B ordinary shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our Sponsor’s Class B ordinary shares, we would need 10,998,541 or 15.3% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or zero or 0% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 46,997,081 Class A ordinary shares that remain outstanding following the Extension to be voted in favor of an initial business combination to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to have their public shares redeemed irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor and each of our directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Class B ordinary shares and public shares in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
•conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
•file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares”. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our directors and executive officers to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our directors and executive officers at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in 
connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” are required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System (the “DWAC System”), at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself before we can validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. To perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to require us to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we must complete our initial business combination, including the proposed Business Combination with X-energy, by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
Our Sponsor, directors and executive officers have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Class B ordinary shares if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion. However, if our Sponsor, directors or executive officers acquire public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion.
Our Sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to require us to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded out of the approximately $38,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account (as of December 31, 2022) plus up to $100,000 of funds from the Trust Account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all material vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us 
waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our directors and executive officers will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if our directors and executive officers believe that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interest of the company given the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by our directors and executive officers to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where our directors and executive officers are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The representatives will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. To protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all material vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $38,000 of proceeds held outside the Trust Account (as of December 31, 2022) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our Trust Account received by any such shareholder. 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not consummate an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion, or (b) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who elect to have their Class A ordinary shares redeemed in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the Trust Account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial business combination by August 4, 2023, or such earlier date as our board of directors may determine in its sole discretion, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval, in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s requiring us to redeem its shares for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. See “—Other Considerations.”
Facilities
Our executive offices are located at 245 Park Avenue, 44th Floor, New York, NY 10167. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $16,667 per month fee we pay to our Sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), or international financial reporting standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential target business will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential target businesses, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to have our internal control procedures audited. X-energy is not and any other target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
Prior to the date of this annual report, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act.
