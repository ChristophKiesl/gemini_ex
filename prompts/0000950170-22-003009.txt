Our Mission
 
Our mission is to transform the meetings and events industry through technology that delivers live engagement across virtual, in-person and hybrid events.
 Business Overview
 Cvent is a leading cloud-based platform of enterprise event marketing and management and hospitality solutions. We power the marketing and management of meetings and events through our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions. Our Event Cloud consists of tools to enable event organizers to manage the entire event lifecycle and deliver engaging experiences across every type of event and all event delivery models: in-person, virtual and hybrid. Event Cloud serves as the system of record for event and engagement data collected across an organization’s total event program, which comprises every internal and external event an organization hosts or attends (“Total Event Program”). Our Hospitality Cloud offers a marketplace that connects event organizers looking for the appropriate event space for their in-person and hybrid events with hoteliers and venue operators through a vertical search engine built on our proprietary database of detailed event space information. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud provides marketing and software solutions that hotels and venues leverage to digitally showcase their event space to attract valuable leads and grow their businesses. This combination of the Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud results in a cohesive platform that we believe generates powerful network effects and attracts more event organizers and hotels and venues.
 Meetings and events are prevalent in organizations of almost every size, industry vertical and geography. The meetings and events space encompasses a broad spectrum of external marketing events, such as customer events, conferences, trade shows and prospect meetings; and internal events, such as sales kick-offs, training seminars, board meetings and companywide gatherings. Enterprises spend an average of 1% to 3% of their revenue on meetings and events, according to 2014 data from BTN Group. Collectively, organizations spent $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018, according to the Industry and Events Council. According to Frost & Sullivan, the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our platform is $29.7 billion, across our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions. See “Business—Our Market Opportunity” for a discussion of what is included in our TAM.
 Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective marketing channels for building engagement with customers, employees and members. External events, whether conducted in-person or virtually, are critical to marketing efforts, as they represent opportunities for enterprises to directly engage with their most important external audiences. Events offer a highly effective way for organizations to maximize engagement throughout the customer journey, helping them to generate and qualify leads, deepen relationships with customers and build brand loyalty and advocacy. According to Forrester, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic. Forrester also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization’s business-to-business (“B2B”) marketing program budget. In addition, internal events aid in employee retention and development, as they offer critical opportunities for HR, training professionals and executive leadership to inspire and motivate their employees through engaging experiences.
 In 2020, the meetings and events industry was transformed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which forced events into virtual environments and accelerated the ongoing digital transformation of the events industry. For virtual events, the event technology is the event venue, video is the primary method of content delivery and virtual attendees create a digital footprint of all of their event engagement that can be captured, analyzed and leveraged to both deliver better event experiences and inform subsequent sales and marketing efforts. Even as the pandemic subsides, we believe virtual events will remain prominent due to their ability to attract and engage vast audiences across the globe.
 However, we believe in the post-pandemic world, the fundamental and innate desire to meet in-person will mean that organizations’ Total Event Programs will feature a combination of virtual events, in-person events and hybrid events that offer the benefits of both. The hybrid event model enables organizations to harness the advantages of both in-person and virtual meetings at the same time by reaching both a broader audience and achieving greater levels of engagement across far more attendees, thereby unlocking the potential for maximum return on their events investment.


With three event types now available to organizations, we believe enterprises will host more events, more frequently and with far more registrants, and that they will also significantly expand their event technology spend given the increased complexity of their Total Event Program. For event professionals, planning, marketing and executing an event is a highly complex endeavor that can become inefficient and time-consuming when managed using traditional manual processes, homegrown solutions or disparate point software solutions. This complexity will be further exacerbated by the proliferation of hybrid events which essentially require planners to simultaneously execute two events that are consistent across distinct event delivery models. With events throughout the customer journey now being held across various event types and multiple event delivery models, organizations increasingly need a single system of record to collect and analyze these interrelated account and attendee engagement data points and act on this data, as well as manage the associated meetings spend, enabling them to measure the impact of, and return on, their events investment.
 We address these challenges faced by event organizers with our end-to-end Event Cloud platform with solutions to drive live engagement and manage all event types and processes within an organization’s Total Event Program. Prior to an event, event organizers use our platform to identify the appropriate venue within our marketplace, secure competitive proposals from venues, configure an event diagram, evaluate and secure speakers to design an impactful agenda, build an event website with tailored registration and pre-event content, market the event by sending segmented invitations and follow-up reminders, conduct pre-event surveys, manage in-person and hybrid event logistics such as travel and lodging, manage budgets and fee collections and produce broadcast-quality video content that can engage attendees before an event occurs. During the course of an event, our platform enables event marketers and planners to process registrations, check-in attendees, conduct virtual and in-person sessions, broadcast pre-recorded or live sessions for online audiences, facilitate online or in-person appointments and lead capture and manage on-going communication with attendees via an event-specific mobile app. Following an event, exhibitors and sponsors can act on leads collected via our platform, while event organizers can leverage our platform to analyze registration, attendance, attendee engagement, session data and survey responses to measure attendee engagement, content effectiveness and overall event success, as well as provide registrants with web or mobile app access to on-demand video content to keep attendees engaged after an event concludes.
 Our platform leverages this proprietary data to generate an engagement score for each attendee. When this data is integrated with an organization’s customer relationship management (“CRM”) and marketing automation system, it can boost existing lead scores and inform the optimal action including sending leads to sales, putting engaged attendees into marketing nurture streams and improving future events. Cross-event analysis also enables organizations to measure the effectiveness of the entirety of their Total Event Program. The ability of our platform to provide organizations with insights into buyer interests across the customer journey across all events has made the event program even more strategic and has positioned event technology as a critical component of an organization’s marketing technology stack.
 Group business is a critical component of revenue and income for the hospitality industry. The groups, meetings and event market accounted for approximately 15% of total U.S. hotel room revenue, or approximately $30 billion, in 2017 according to a study by Kalibri, and, among full-service hotels characterized by higher published room rates, group business accounts for 30% to 35% of room nights. Beyond room night revenue, according to that same report, hotels generated another $110 billion from food and beverage, event space, audiovisual support, equipment rental, transportation and other services. We believe that as the hospitality industry seeks to recover from the significant impact of the pandemic, hoteliers and venues will actively seek to drive group meeting business and will turn to digital marketing tools and supporting software solutions to reach buyers globally at scale, to market and sell their event space, services and sleeping rooms.
 Our Hospitality Cloud solution offers vertical online marketplaces that connect event organizers seeking event space to hotels and venues. Our platform helps hotels find event organizers and win group business by enabling them to advertise and digitally showcase their event space, and also provides event organizers with tools to search, diligence, negotiate and contract with hotels for that event space. The largest of these marketplaces is Cvent Supplier Network (“CSN”), which connects over 90,000 meeting and event organizers with over 290,000 hotels and venues featured in our proprietary global database as of December 31, 2021. We believe that CSN contains one of the world’s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information, empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace generates significant network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (“RFPs”), submitted from event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs.
 Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage, and execute events. Our software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs, three-dimensional hotel tours, event diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing three-dimensional renderings, room block management to enable event attendees to reserve hotel rooms, business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics.
 We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter into annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The amount of these sum-certain contracts is based on a committed annual number of registrants and events across an organization’s Total Event Program. As of

December 31, 2021, we had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers. For our Hospitality Cloud, hotels and venues enter into annual and multi-year contracts for group business marketing solutions and software. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,000 Hospitality Cloud customers.
 The structure of our platform allows us to employ a land-and-expand business model, where customers grow their spend with us over time. As our Event Cloud customers grow their Total Event Program by launching new types of events, running more events and attracting additional registrants to their events, their contracts are typically renewed at higher annual values. Additionally, customers purchasing our platform to replace certain homegrown or multiple disparate point solutions may initially purchase only one or a few of our solutions. As those customers recognize the value of an integrated platform, they typically expand their footprint over time. As of December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 our net dollar retention rate was 101.0%, 89.2%, and 108.4%, respectively, with the decline in 2020 primarily due to impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the increase in 2021 primarily due to the lessening impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and the adoption of our new virtual solution, Attendee Hub. See the section titled “Key Business Metrics” in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding our net dollar retention rate.
 On December 8, 2021, we consummated the business combination (the “Reverse Recapitalization Transaction”) with Dragoneer Growth Opportunities Corp. II., a Cayman Islands exempted company and the predecessor company of the surviving company following the Reverse Recapitalization Transaction (“Dragoneer”) as contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2021 (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”). See the section titled “Reverse Recapitalization Transaction” in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information regarding the Reverse Recapitalization Transaction.
 Impact of COVID-19 on Operating Results
 COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Many governments instituted lockdowns or other similar measures to slow infection rates. In response to COVID-19, as many other companies have done, we required substantially all of our employees to continue to work remotely; implemented travel restrictions; and postponed or canceled our in-person customer, industry and employee events, and converted other events to virtual-only experiences.
 The global COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our ability to sign new or renew existing clients. Our customer count declined 19.3% as of December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. Further, the global COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our ability to sign new clients, and to upsell to and renew contracts with our existing clients, starting in March 2020. Despite these challenges, total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $20.1 million, or 4.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic affects our business will depend on future developments in the United States and around the world, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and different COVID-19 variants, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions required to contain and treat it, among others. Although the ultimate impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results remains uncertain, a continued and prolonged public health crisis such as the global COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — The effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
 Industry Trends and Opportunities
 Event Cloud
 Increased Importance of Meetings and Events to Chief Marketing Officers During and After the Pandemic. Meetings and events offer opportunities for enterprises to engage directly with their customers for extended periods of time, and as a result, can represent some of the most effective and highest value touchpoints along the entire customer journey. With the growth in virtual and hybrid events, the opportunities to use events to directly engage with a larger audience has grown significantly. Marquee events such as user conferences and tradeshows present companies with significant marketing and sales opportunities, providing a forum to engage with hundreds or thousands of their prospects, customers and partners in attendance. As a result, meetings and events can represent one of the enterprise’s most influential marketing channels. According to Forrester, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic.
 Due to their importance to the customer journey, meetings and events can be a significant component of the marketing efforts for any organization. Forrester also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization’s B2B marketing program budget. Given the significance of the associated spend, the ability of events to generate engagement to showcase

buyer interests, and event’s expected direct impact on sales pipeline, we believe that chief marketing officers and other C-suite executives will have a heightened interest in their success and effectiveness.
 Increased Importance of Internal Meetings and Events to Engage Employees. In a world characterized by increasingly distributed workforces, organizations will rely more than ever on events, whether in-person, virtual or hybrid, to engage and retain employees who will now have fewer daily in-person interactions. With the option to host virtual and hybrid events, we believe employers will host events more frequently to enhance employee engagement, facilitate networking opportunities, help establish and maintain company culture, attract and recruit new employees, offer immersive opportunities for career development and lower attrition. As companies look to provide differentiated workplace experiences to attract and retain top talent, we believe internal events will become even more important to HR and other C-suite executives.
 Fundamental Shift to Virtual and Hybrid Event Environments. Prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the meetings and events industry was principally dominated by in-person events, including customer events, user conferences, industry trade shows and group meetings. Virtual events were typically characterized by limited scope, small audiences and undifferentiated content. Existing solutions for hosting these virtual events were generally built for one-way interactions, offered limited engagement opportunities and often were not integrated into a company’s broader marketing technology stack.
 However, the global COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the complete reimagining of virtual events, as event organizers swiftly moved their historically in-person cornerstone events to entirely virtual environments. This virtual event environment, whereby the technology itself is the event venue, has fundamentally increased the role and mission-criticality of event marketing and management solutions. Enterprise scale events cannot be held virtually without a software platform designed to enable enterprises to build immersive, interactive and seamlessly branded experiences, run multiple simultaneous live or on-demand sessions, facilitate attendee interaction, capture attendee, exhibitor and sponsor data and maximize engagement throughout the entirety of the event. When event technology is the venue, virtual platforms must be secure, scalable and stable or risk an entire event being compromised, delayed or cancelled.
 When the impact of the pandemic subsides, we expect that in-person events will return as a critical component of the events landscape, due to their unmatched ability to drive face-to-face engagement, networking, loyalty and overall business impact. However, following the success of the virtual events held throughout the pandemic, we believe many of these in-person events will become hybrid events that prominently feature virtual components to enable event organizers to maximize audience reach and engagement. We believe that while companies will continue to host standalone in-person and virtual events, the hybrid event model will become the industry standard, enabling event organizers to experience the benefits of both from a single event and maximize the return on their events investment. We also believe that the increased value proposition of a larger Total Event Program led by hybrid events will drive event organizers to host more events, more frequently, attracting more attendees, and thus increasing their total event technology spend.
 Accelerated Adoption of Event Technology to Automate Highly Complex Planning Process. Organizing and executing a meeting, event, or conference is a highly complex process, involving a multitude of discrete tasks that are often tedious, manual and very costly. For example, in order to research and secure venues prior to its start, manage logistics during the event and analyze interaction data and facilitate attendee follow-up after the event, event organizers have often used an inefficient and disparate combination of tools, including general internet search engines, event magazines, telephone calls, spreadsheets, emails and internally developed systems. In addition, event organizers must coordinate with various internal stakeholders, including individuals in marketing, sales, travel, human resources, training and development and operations, as well as a broad range of external stakeholders, including the event venue operator, service providers, registrants and attendees, speakers, exhibitors and sponsors. The various stakeholders each require different information and communication strategies.
 While many enterprises have embraced digital transformation by investing in enterprise software to automate workflows, streamline business processes and enable data collection and analysis for several departments, including finance, sales, marketing, expense management and human resources, organizations have generally not made similar investments in event technology to manage and automate the activities of event organizers and their Total Event Program.
 The transition to virtual events during the global COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to effectively manage a combination of in-person, virtual and hybrid events, has resulted in new complexities in managing a Total Event Program. While hybrid events offer significant flexibility to attendees, they add incredible complexity to the organizer, as they require the delivery of two different, but consistent experiences over one event for all parts of the event lifecycle. We believe that this increased complexity has resulted in an inflection point that will accelerate the digital transformation of the event management space.
 Some event organizers have attempted to address these challenges with external point solutions or internally developed tools that we believe do not give them direct control over the attendee experience, are not built to deliver engaging experiences and do not provide access to real-time, actionable data. Moreover, these tools and point solutions do not address the entire event lifecycle or the full range of event delivery models. As a result, these organizations may struggle to effectively plan, manage, measure and improve

their events, which may reduce or eliminate the associated sales and marketing benefits. We believe these challenges will lead organizations to embrace and expand their use of event technology to harness the full potential of their Total Event Program.
 Challenge of Managing All Event Delivery Models to Unlock Actionable Insights Across a Total Event Program. With the emergence of virtual and hybrid events, event organizers must now manage a Total Event Program consisting of multiple events across all event delivery models. Over the course of a customer’s journey from initial awareness to closing of a sale, an enterprise may interact with that customer through an in-person industry trade show, a virtual webinar, an in-person seminar, a hybrid roadshow, an in-person prospect development event, a hybrid user conference and a virtual customer event, among other interactions. For any given event, interaction and engagement data helps to provide a more accurate view into that customer’s interests and intent.
 When combined across all of the events in a Total Event Program, this engagement data can deliver actionable insights into the optimal action in that customer’s journey, helping organizations identify leads and advance sales opportunities. Some event organizers may attempt to manage their Total Event Program and attendee data with an array of disparate point solutions designed for a specific event delivery model, like virtual only or in-person only, or designed only for a specific portion of the event lifecycle, such as registration, a mobile app or onsite check-in. However, these point solutions leave attendee engagement data isolated in silos and typically lack the functionality for executing events across event delivery models, as well as the integration and data sharing capabilities to create a single system of record for the Total Event Program. We believe the inability to put together a full and clear picture of interest will lead organizations to use one event technology platform that can show prospect and customer intent across the Total Event Program.
 Broad Range of Channels to Engage with Attendees throughout the Event Lifecycle. Communication with attendees throughout the event lifecycle is critical and event organizers utilize a wide variety of mediums to reach their intended audience, including email, online advertising, text messaging, virtual chat messaging, social media platforms and video content. Event organizers also engage with attendees through mobile event apps and, for virtual events, through the virtual event venue. Event organizers leverage these channels to market their event prior to its start, increase engagement through gamification, share event-related information in real-time, establish interactive online attendee networks and communities during the event and connect with attendees following the event to continue attendee engagement and solicit valuable feedback essential to future event planning and sales follow-up. However, we believe many event organizers struggle to maintain consistent messaging and branding across the numerous channels through which they are interacting with attendees. Marketers and planners require a comprehensive cross-channel platform to help them interact with attendees throughout the event lifecycle across the customer’s entire journey in one consistent voice.
 Events to Provide Long-term On-Demand Content that Will Extend the Life of Events and Greatly Impact the Buyer’s Journey. Events provide the opportunity for organizations to engage with their attendees before an event and extend engagement with attendees after an event concludes, through on-demand video and content marketing incorporated into their virtual elements. During the pandemic, organizations utilized virtual events to drive audiences to digital video content that could be easily accessed before the event, during the event and on-demand after the event. The combination of events and content on video platforms gives organizers the ability to create an environment where events are no longer constrained by specific event dates, creating opportunities for engagement before, during, and after an event concludes.
 Need for Greater Visibility into Meeting and Event Spend and Return on Investment. Enterprises have increasingly adopted software platforms to provide visibility into areas of spend throughout the organization. However, companies have historically lacked a cloud-based solution to centrally monitor and manage the spend associated with their meetings and events. As event planning and execution is often not limited to one department or one specific role and, in our experience, planners are typically not required to seek advance approval for event, meeting and conference expenses, organizations have very limited visibility into and control over the level and allocation of event spend. With an accurate picture of spend, planners are able to calculate the return on their meetings and events investments.
 As meetings and events budgets have grown, enterprises are adopting event marketing and management software to help them assess the aggregate spend, make the event process more efficient and leverage spend data in vendor negotiations. With an accurate picture of spend, event organizers are able to calculate the return on their meetings and events investments. This analysis can in turn be used to justify additional events spend, particularly as event organizers seek to expand their Total Event Program with hybrid and virtual events. Event spend management can also ensure that events are effectively designed, organized and managed to meet targeted objectives. For example, certain event organizers in more regulated environments, such as pharmaceutical sales, face comprehensive regulatory requirements, like reporting on spend per Health Care Professional, that are not easily manageable with manual processes.
 Hospitality Cloud
 Fiercely Competitive Hospitality Landscape Exacerbated by Pandemic. In normal operating environments, hotels generate revenue from three primary types of business: leisure travel, business travel and event and group business. Meetings also drive hotel revenue from food and beverage, event space, audiovisual support, equipment rental, transportation and other services. According to a

2017 study by Kalibri, hotels generated approximately $30 billion in room revenue from group business plus another $110 billion from food and beverage, audiovisual support, ground transportation and other services. Additionally, event attendees are typically hotel guests that may utilize the hotel’s restaurants, shops, spas and other paid amenities. Given the highly profitable nature of events and group meetings, competition to attract and win this business has increased significantly among hotels. With the global COVID-19 pandemic temporarily reducing the overall demand for hotel business and creating excess supply, hoteliers looking to recover from the pandemic have further increased competition between hotels to attract this highly coveted events and group meetings business.
 Underinvestment in Group Meetings Business. Event organizers can be found across a broad range of departments, including marketing, sales, travel, human resources, training and development and operations, and have a wide variety of titles. Due to this decentralized and non-standard nature of event planning within enterprises, hoteliers often find it challenging to identify highly qualified leads and accurately market to the professionals responsible for planning meetings and events within most organizations. As a result of this challenge and the typically heavy manual effort involved, hotels generally underinvest in sales and marketing efforts to solicit and generate this group meetings business, despite its critical importance to drive revenue. Without an effective way to conduct outbound marketing, hotels must rely on less targeted marketing tactics or on inbound leads to solicit interest and generate events and group meetings business. We believe that hotels and venues that leverage scalable technology solutions, such as ours, that are built for their target audience are better positioned to attract more business and increase their return on marketing spend.
 Need to Digitize and Automate Highly Manual RFP and Group Business Processes. In searching for a venue, event organizers often submit inquiries and bids to hotels in a variety of formats, including emails, phone calls and PDF, Word or Excel files. In responding to these requests, many hoteliers and venue operators rely on a variety of generic business tools including word processing applications, spreadsheets and scanned documents. This non-standard process results in increased time and cost associated with an RFP for both parties. In managing confirmed group meetings business, hoteliers and event organizers also typically leverage these generic tools to gather guest data, book rooms and organize room reservations. In our experience, these tools increase the time and cost burden of the process, often increase the chance of data entry error and could heighten the risk of data privacy issues. As hotels look to streamline efforts and ensure compliance, additional technology solutions will be required.
 Need to Showcase Meeting and Event Space in a Virtual Environment. Traditionally, hoteliers and venue operators have showcased their properties to event organizers with in-person site visits. However, even before the pandemic, hoteliers had begun to utilize virtual tools to showcase a property and visualize different floorplan layouts as organizations looked to reduce spend and streamline the event planning process. The pandemic has further accelerated the trend of online and virtual sourcing, to the extent that many event organizers now expect online site tours and interactive floorplans and event diagrams to be a standard offering.
 Need for Group Business Intelligence to Compete More Effectively. Given the highly profitable nature of group meetings business, the competition to attract and win this business has increased significantly among hotels. In order to uncover new areas of opportunity and generate leads, hotels and venue operators need to leverage data to evaluate their performance in this segment. Business intelligence can provide insights into RFP trends, response activities, win ratios, pace against expected demand, and other key performance metrics. Business intelligence also enables hotels and venue operators to evaluate their group performance relative to their competition and to identify opportunities for improvement.
 Key Benefits of Our Solution
 Event Cloud. We provide event organizers with a comprehensive platform to drive live engagement and manage the entire lifecycle of meetings and events across their Total Event Program, which includes virtual, in-person, and hybrid events. Our cloud-based platform delivers event organizers the following benefits:
 •Increase Efficiency by Automating Key Processes throughout the Event Lifecycle. Our event marketing and management solutions enable enterprises to automate workflows and streamline labor-intensive business processes associated with organizing, marketing and executing meetings and events. For venue selection, our CSN venue-sourcing tool enables event organizers to quickly search for suitable venues, send RFPs, and compare the resulting bids side-by-side, allowing them to more rapidly identify, contact and negotiate with potential venues. Our solution also enables event organizers to produce highly sophisticated and fully customized event websites and virtual event experiences without any professional web-design or back-end coding needed. We offer a sophisticated site builder featuring a simple drag-and-drop interface, automated validation for best practices, logic checks and link checks, version history control and responsive design. Once built, these websites can be cloned and lightly edited to create new events in minutes. In addition to these processes, our solution also automates a number of traditionally manual processes throughout the event lifecycle, including processing online registrations and payments, collecting attendee information and preferences, creating custom schedules for attendees and automatically updating attendees of schedule changes via an event-specific mobile application. In the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic, event organizers are able to deliver safer in-person events with our diagram check tools that provide accurate spacing of event floorplans and via contactless event and session check-in and lead capture products. Our platform automates many of the daily tasks of an event organizers, leaving them with more time to focus on other core valuable activities.


•Increase Meeting and Event Attendance. Our event marketing and management solutions allow organizations to maximize registration and attendance at events across their Total Event Program. Our integrated event marketing solution empowers event organizers to develop sophisticated, multi-channel marketing campaigns to efficiently and effectively reach a large audience with their event promotions. The campaigns can be tailored to reference personal event attendance history and can be differentiated per each audience segment. Our robust contact management functionality enables event organizers to simplify and automate the process of collecting and maintaining accurate contact information by integrating with an organization’s existing marketing and CRM databases, while also allowing prospective attendees to seamlessly provide their most up-to-date contact information during the event registration process. Once organizers attract prospective attendees to their event website, our advanced registration features such as early bird discounts, coupon codes and dynamic registration paths, permit organizers to customize offerings based on their separate attendee segments and event goals. By offering integrated solutions for marketing and event registration across all event delivery models, we believe we help event organizers maximize the overall attendance and impact of their events.
•Enhance the Attendee, Sponsor, Exhibitor and Host or Venue Experience. We believe our platform enables event organizers to deliver a better overall event experience for all those who attend or support the event including general attendees, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as the host venue. Whether an event is in-person, virtual or hybrid, our platform helps to create an experience that is more engaging, interactive and impactful. For example, in a virtual environment, attendees can network and engage with their peers through live chat, engage session speakers through live polling and Q&A and view presentations live or on-demand based on a catalog of recommended sessions aligned to their preferences. For an in-person experience, sponsors and exhibitors can derive more value from the event through gamification and reminders to schedule one-on-one appointments via a mobile event app. Pre- and post-event surveys allow all stakeholders to share insights that can be used to improve future events. For all delivery models, we believe our technology enhances the overall stakeholder experience and drives deep engagement, which leads to higher attendee satisfaction and increased attendance at future events, resulting in more business for the organizer.
 •Create, Measure and Act on Attendee Engagement to Increase Sales Pipeline. We believe our solutions enable event organizers to create events that maximize engagement points across the event lifecycle and collect and analyze this data across their Total Event Program. Engagement data includes: event attendance; session attendance, including time spent in virtual sessions; product and trade show booth visits; appointments attended; survey responses; polls taken; questions submitted via Q&A; and participation in chat, among others. Our platform synthesizes all of these attendee actions into a single attendee engagement score. Virtual and hybrid events enable organizations to track millions of attendee interaction points, including in-person activity that hadn’t historically been digitized, and virtual attendee activity. When our attendee engagement scores are correlated with data from marketing automation and CRM systems, event organizers receive the clearest, most complete picture of customers and prospects that can be used to determine the next-best actions in the customer journey.
 •Track, Manage and Measure Event Expenditure to Measure Return On Investment (“ROI”) of Events. As event planning and execution is often not limited to one department or one specific role and, in our experience, event organizers are typically not required to seek advance approval for associated expenses, organizations have very limited visibility into and control over the level and allocation of event spend. Our solution streamlines, automates and enhances event planning processes to provide end-to-end visibility into all corporate meetings and events. Our software enables the tracking of all meeting processes and data by compiling sourcing data from CSN, attendance data from our event marketing and management solutions, budget data from event organizers, actual expenditures from credit card platforms and expense data from platforms such as Concur. Our software acts as the system of record for all event processes, spend, engagement data and data privacy and security program compliance to provide visibility into budgeting, saving users time, de-risking spend and enabling the measurement of event ROI.
 
Hospitality Cloud. We provide hotels and venues solutions to market their event space to attract event organizers and gain RFPs, manage leads through the sales process and measure performance against internal and external metrics. Our marketplace and software deliver hoteliers and venue operators the following benefits:
 •Market to Event Organizers to Increase Events and Group Meetings Business Revenue. Hoteliers and venue operators leverage our online marketing solutions to target event organizers looking for event space. Due to the tens of thousands of event organizers that we drive to our sourcing networks, our solutions make it easier for hoteliers and venue operators to market to relevant, hard-to-identify event organizer personnel within organizations, which we believe results in an increased number of sales leads and converted event and group meetings bookings. We believe that compared to other marketing channels, this represents an extremely scalable, cost-efficient way to win event business and increase revenue.


•Enhance Productivity and Efficiency Through Automation. We enable hoteliers and venues to automate and standardize the process by which they receive and respond to RFPs from event organizers. We provide a standardized framework that enables hotels and venues to pre-populate many responses, so their employees can respond to RFPs quickly and accurately. With hoteliers and venue operators having reduced workforces in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our solution empowers them to automate marketing and sales processes to drive efficiency with fewer resources. In addition, hoteliers and venue operators leverage our software solutions to automate the entire group lifecycle beyond the sourcing process. For example, hotels utilize Lead Scoring to prioritize and assign RFPs and Passkey to manage group room blocks and process room reservations more efficiently and securely.
 •Strengthen Collaboration Between Hoteliers and Event Organizers. Our solution enables hoteliers and venue operators to showcase their event spaces virtually in three dimensions and collaboratively design safe event layouts in real-time with event organizers, helping to streamline processes that were often manual, time consuming and ad-hoc.
 •Better Analyze Operational Results through CSN Business Intelligence. Hoteliers and venue operators can closely monitor the volume of prospected and closed business received through CSN, as well as our other sourcing platforms, enabling them to more effectively measure their return on marketing investments. Managers can also improve the performance and productivity of their sales representatives by monitoring responsiveness to RFPs, tracking successful bids and benchmarking their performance against internal and targeted competitive metrics. Our CSN Business Intelligence is also available to chains, brands and hotel management companies to help them measure, evaluate and improve the performance of the properties in their portfolios.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths provide us with sustainable competitive differentiation relative to our competitors:
 
One Platform to Drive Live Engagement and Take Action Across the Total Event Program. Our platform enables organizations to manage and execute internal and external events of all sizes, complexities and delivery models. For external customer-facing events, we power events that a company hosts, as well as conferences and trade shows that a company attends as an exhibitor or sponsor. Our platform serves as a single system of record for the Total Event Program, enabling event organizers to maximize, collect and take action on attendee registration and engagement data before, during and after events. This centralized repository of data collected from attendee interactions across multiple events throughout the customer journey delivers actionable intelligence on the interests and preferences of an organization’s customers and prospects. We believe that our ability to offer an integrated platform that maximizes live engagement across a full suite of event marketing and management solutions for in-person, virtual and hybrid events is a key competitive differentiator when compared to competitors offering point solutions for specific processes or event delivery models.
 
Management of the Entire Event Lifecycle. We offer an integrated, end-to-end, cloud-based platform that addresses the entire lifecycle of meetings and events of every type and delivery model. Our platform offers solutions for every aspect of an event from event inception to post-event follow-up. Companies using point solutions are required to cobble together disparate products and data silos from across the event lifecycle to manage a single event. Importing and exporting data into and out of multiple systems creates data integrity concerns and potential risk as it relates to privacy laws. Our platform approach enables organizations to streamline the workflow for managing all elements of an event, and results in a more fluid, branded, secure and engaging experience for attendees.
 
Large Online Marketplace. We believe that CSN is a valuable resource for both components of the meetings and events ecosystem — marketers and event planners and hoteliers and venues — due to its:
 •Depth and Breadth of Venue Profiles. Our proprietary network includes detailed event space profile information on over 290,000 hotels and other venues as of December 31, 2021. CSN enables planners to conduct searches and filter results based on over 200 characteristics and criteria per hotel profile. For example, planners can narrow their search based on a variety of factors, including the number of hotel sleeping rooms or meeting rooms, meeting room size or ceiling heights, meeting room capacity based on customized layouts, hotel amenities, available promotions and distance from the airport. Once an event space is identified, CSN enables planners to visit some venues virtually via three-dimensional models. A portion of the underlying event data is submitted by the hotels and venues and a portion is researched by our expert team, which has created an extensive data set with an exceptional level of detail and granularity. Our team of customer-facing staff maintain relationships and work with the venues to keep their information up to date and enhance the data richness of CSN. The size and accuracy of our database is of critical importance to planners and sets CSN apart.
 •Billions in RFP Value. During 2019, planners sourced approximately $18.1 billion in RFP value through our sourcing tools, including CSN. Even as the global COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of in-person events, planners sourced approximately $8.8 billion in RFP value during 2020 and approximately $9.1 billion in 2021. This network effect also helps us continue to increase our brand awareness, leading to increased sales of our event marketing and management solutions. For hotels that manage the largest number of properties, we believe that by offering a global marketplace for both sides of the events ecosystem, CSN is a critical external lead generation channel for event and group meetings business.


•Integration with Hotels. As of December 31, 2021, we are directly integrated with the back-end sales and catering and IT systems of more than 40,000 hotels, reducing manual data entry by hoteliers and enabling a more efficient RFP response process. We believe this level of adoption and back-end IT system integration from our hotel partners is further evidence of the value hoteliers and venues derive from CSN.
 •Powerful Network Effects Across the Events Ecosystem. By connecting both sides of the meetings and events ecosystem, CSN generates significant network effects. As more hoteliers and venue operators list and market their properties on the CSN, it becomes more valuable to event planners and marketers sourcing venues for their events. Increased usage by event planners increases the volume of RFPs delivered to hotels and venues, thereby increasing the value we deliver to hoteliers and venue operators and causing more hotels and venues to list their properties on the network.
 •Efficiency for Planners. Planners use CSN, generally at no cost, to search for venues, request price quotes and proposals from hotels and venues and compare proposals to identify the venue that best meets the specialized needs and requirements of their event. The vertical nature of CSN makes it a highly relevant and effective tool for planners in identifying an appropriate venue. CSN also provides substantial time savings benefits, as planners can quickly evaluate an extensive network of potential hotels and venues and receive rapid responses from a selected shortlist.
 •Lead Sourcing for Hoteliers and Venue Operators. Hotel and venue operators list their event spaces, generally at no cost, on CSN in order to receive and respond to event proposal requests from planners. Our ability to connect hoteliers and venue operators with high quality leads makes us an essential resource for hoteliers and venue operators and has resulted in a significant volume of RFPs processed. In part due to the extensive scope of our marketplace, many hotels have integrated CSN into their core back-end IT systems.
Relationships with Meeting and Event Planners. Unlike personnel in traditional, clearly defined departments, planners can often be based within a wide range of corporate departments, such as marketing, sales, travel, human resources, training and development and operations. Professionals ranging from marketing managers to sales representatives to executive assistants are tasked with organizing and executing meetings and events. Given the periodic nature of events, in many cases event planning falls outside of the scope of their day-to-day responsibilities and these professionals dedicate only a portion of their time to event planning. Through our more than two decades supporting the events industry, we have developed a substantial, internal, proprietary database of professionals who we believe are involved in meeting and event planning activities within their organizations. Given our industry prominence and the millions of events we have powered throughout our history, we have deep domain expertise on how to maximize event success, and we create thought leadership content that we promote to our database and through digital marketing. Each year, we engage with an increasing number of industry professionals, allowing us to build new relationships and continue to grow our prominence in the industry.
 
Recurring Revenue Model. Our business model is highly recurring with annual or multi-year subscriptions under sum-certain contracts. Given the number of multi-year contracts, we have strong visibility into and predictability of future revenue, as well as resiliency, as evidenced by our performance during the early stages of the pandemic. Contracts for our Event Cloud solution range from one to five years in length. These contracts generally include subscription fees for licensed modules, which are based on volume commitments aligned with the registrations and events anticipated across the customer’s Total Event Program. Our Event Cloud contracts typically include overage fees for usage beyond the specified registrant and event amounts. We also sell our Hospitality Cloud solutions to hoteliers and venue operators through annual or multi-year contracts, which typically range from one to three years. These contracts typically include subscription fees for our marketing placements and licensed software modules. The predictability of future revenue allows us to more confidently invest in R&D so we stay on the forefront of technology innovation.
 
Investment in Product Innovation. We have a team of over 1,300 in Client Services as of December 31, 2021 that actively collect daily feedback and enhancement requests from our wide and varied user base. We also host an online Cvent Community where thousands of users go to ask questions, network with peers and provide suggestions and feedback on future product direction. Our team of over 1,100 employees as of December 31, 2021 working in research and development operate in an agile development environment and are able to release new feature capabilities and modules on a weekly basis that we believe address the rapidly evolving needs of the industry. Additionally, we place high value on and invest significantly in information and cloud platform security. We believe that relative to our competitors, we have a faster pace of innovation, deeper dedication to security, compliance and data privacy and larger investment in next-gen technology that will further strengthen our solutions, especially for virtual and hybrid events.
 
Global Scale of Operations. With approximately 4,300 employees around the world as of December 31, 2021 and offices in eight countries, we are positioned to both support our growing global user base and enter into new markets. By hiring regional experts, we are able to strategically expand our market presence by tapping into the characteristics of the local marketplace, which in turns helps us build stronger relationships and rapport with those customers. To further support our global scale, we also maintain extensive operations in India, with approximately 2,100 employees based in our Indian office as of December 31, 2021. Every department within the organization has employees in India. Our Indian operations enable us to achieve important business objectives including: (i) near-continuous research and development and customer service operations; (ii) expanded international sales and marketing reach worldwide; and (iii) development and maintenance of our proprietary databases of venues and hotels. In addition, the majority of our marketing

personnel for the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa regions are based in our India location. Finally, we leverage our India-based personnel to expand and maintain our massive repository of detailed and in-depth venue information, consisting of over 450 million square feet of event space across over 290,000 venues as of December 31, 2021. Our Indian operations enable us to benefit from the labor and infrastructure cost advantages of the region and to accomplish many critical business tasks in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We established our India operations initially for cost savings, have expanded our presence in India due to its value proposition, and we continue to invest in India for innovation.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Meetings and events represent one of the most effective ways for organizations to engage, educate and motivate their target audiences. This value proposition is why meetings and events are often regarded as some of the most effective and best funded marketing strategies, and why they are critical to effective internal employee engagement.
 
While meetings and events have always been important, the accelerated digital transformation of the events industry driven by the global COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a new events landscape where a combination of virtual, in-person and hybrid events will proliferate in the marketplace. In this new landscape, organizations are able to reach larger audiences, engage with greater frequency and deliver differentiated experiences. Event technology will be critical to engaging with event attendees and managing all processes needed to plan, promote and execute events across a Total Event Program and to providing a single system of record for all event data.
 
Our platform delivers a single system of record for organizations to manage their Total Event Program, regardless of venue—in-person, virtual or hybrid—and regardless of audience—internal or external. Our platform enables customers to not only drive engagement, increase efficiency and scale their Total Event Programs, but also to integrate these solutions into their broader engagement and marketing strategy. According to Frost & Sullivan, the TAM for our platform is $29.7 billion, across our Event Cloud and Hospitality cloud solutions.
 
Cvent Event Cloud. According to Frost & Sullivan, the annual TAM for the Event Cloud is $25.6 billion worldwide. The TAM was calculated by first estimating the total number of organizations that our platform and products address, segmented by size of employee base and organization type, including corporate and non-corporate, based on the 2017 Statistics of U.S. Businesses and 2020 U.S. Census Data. Addressability assumptions were then applied by segment and band based on our experience in the market. An estimated annual value was then applied to each band of organizations based on survey responses related to spend on event technology. The total number of companies within each band was then multiplied by the calculated annual value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current annual estimated market opportunity of $14.1 billion and $11.5 billion in the United States and Rest of World, respectively.
 
Cvent Hospitality Cloud. According to Frost & Sullivan, the annual TAM for the Hospitality Cloud is $4.1 billion. The TAM is calculated by first estimating the total number of hotels with meeting space, segmented by geography, market tier, and banded by total square footage of meeting space. Addressability assumptions were then applied by segment and product based on our experience in the market. An estimated annual spend was then applied to each band of hotels and venues based on survey responses related to spend on group marketing in digital channels. The total number of hotels and venues within each band was then multiplied by the calculated annual value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current global annual estimated market opportunity of $4.1 billion.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 Expand Our Customer Base by Adding New Marketers, Planners, Hotels and Venues. We believe that with the emergence of virtual and hybrid meetings, and the accelerated digital transformation of the events industry, organizations will host more events, with more attendees, and will have a greater need for event technology. Organizations will require a single platform capable of driving live engagement and managing all of their events, which will further increase the demand for our solutions. We believe a significant portion of organizations that have had to embrace virtual events during the pandemic have seen the promise of event digitalization and will no longer rely on homegrown tools and manual processes to manage events.
 We also believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our penetration into hotels and venues. As the pandemic abates and in-person events return, group meetings business will again represent a significant component of hotel revenue. We believe that hoteliers seeking to recover their group meetings revenue will increasingly seek out technology solutions to market their venues and generate incremental business. With hoteliers and venue operators operating with reduced workforces in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our solution enables them to automate marketing and sales processes to drive efficiency with fewer resources.


Facilitate Upsell and Cross-Sell Activity Within Our Event Cloud Customers. Our Event Cloud consists of multiple solutions for marketing and managing enterprise meetings and events. As of December 31, 2021, 49.6% of our Event Cloud customers have subscriptions to more than one of our solutions. We believe there is a significant opportunity to cross-sell additional solutions such as Onsite Solutions, Lead Capture, Appointments and Attendee Hub to power the virtual attendee experience and the mobile event app and many other add-on modules within our existing base of approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers as of December 31, 2021. As the meetings and events ecosystem shifts toward a combination of in-person, virtual and hybrid events, we believe that organizations will derive even greater value from a platform that drives engagement and enables the seamless management of their Total Event Program. We also believe that the expanded reach and effectiveness of virtual and hybrid events drive growth in both the number of events and the number of registrants, and that these customers will expand their usage of the Event Cloud over time. As a result, we believe that our renewing Event Cloud customers are likely to increase their overall contract value through both larger Total Event Programs and the adoption of additional solutions. Additionally, we believe that we can cross-sell new subscriptions or additional functionality to the over 90,000 planners that have access to the CSN free of charge, some of whom also have paid subscriptions to our other Event Cloud solutions.
 Facilitate Upsell and Cross-Sell Activity Within Our Hospitality Cloud Customers. Our Hospitality Cloud solution not only connects hotels and venues with tens of thousands of planners, but also provides a suite of products to market their venues and manage sales and operations of their group business. We continue to expand our inventory of marketing placements and add specialized tiers for hotels and venues to purchase. As we add these new capabilities, we believe that hoteliers and venue operators will leverage our marketplace offerings to reach buyers at scale and expand the use of our platform to manage the marketing, sales and operations of their group meetings business more efficiently and profitably.
 Expand Our Marketing Lead Generation, Direct Salesforce and Go-to-Market models. We intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to expand our direct salesforce and increase our reach in the marketplace. We believe these investments will drive leads, expand our sales coverage and improve the efficiency and efficacy of our sales efforts. We are also investing in our partnerships, where we have strategic relationships with industry groups, technology providers and event and travel management companies. We will continue to develop other strategic relationships that both complement our existing sales reach and enhance the value proposition we provide to our customers.
Expand Our International Footprint. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand globally and increase our revenue derived from outside of North America, which accounted for 13.3% and 12.3% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In our experience, the adoption rate of technology outside North America has typically lagged North American adoption. For example, with respect to the Hospitality Cloud, while our hotel and venue listings represent approximately 61% of the total venues in CSN as of December 31, 2021, only a small percentage of our RFPs are sent to these international hotels and venues. If the volume of international meeting RFPs on the CSN increases, we expect our international revenue to expand. We opened our first European sales office in London in May 2013 to support our international expansion, and we now have sales offices in eight countries across North America, Europe, APAC and the Middle East.
 Extend Our Product Leadership and Introduce Additional Solutions to Our Platform. We have invested significantly in research and development to build and improve our platform over time. The strength of our platform and solutions has helped to solidify our position as a leading cloud-based platform for enterprise event marketing and management and hospitality solutions. We have added additional products and features over time and regularly implement updates and improvements to our platform in order to improve our competitive position relative to competitors, meet the needs of our customers and to improve the event experience for all stakeholders in the event ecosystem. We also intend to opportunistically acquire companies that we believe have solutions that extend the capabilities of our platform and can readily be put through our existing sales and marketing distribution channel.
Our Platform
 
We offer a software-as-a-service platform focused on the event and hospitality industry. Our platform is comprised of two parts: the Event Cloud and the Hospitality Cloud. Our platform drives live engagement across the Total Event Program for corporations of all sizes, as well as for associations, universities, non-profits, governmental entities and others. Additionally, our platform enables marketers and event planners to organize all types of events that comprise a Total Event Program, whether virtual, in-person or hybrid, with solutions for the entire lifecycle of each individual event. Our platform also provides a comprehensive marketplace that connects planners with hotels and venues.
Event Cloud
 
The Event Cloud is a portfolio of event marketing and management solutions that enables marketers and planners to maximize engagement and ROI from their virtual, in-person or hybrid events (including webinars), while automating and simplifying the management of each stage of the event lifecycle. Our solutions can be deployed independently or together as a cohesive and fully integrated platform.
 
For marketers, we offer a single platform to maximize live engagement across the event channel, with powerful tools to reach, engage and convert their virtual, in-person and hybrid attendees into customer leads and sales. Our platform provides marketers with a robust set of automated and personalized audience generation tools to help them attract more virtual and in-person audiences to their events. Before, during, and after the event experience, our platform offers engagement features that allow marketers to capture attendee interest across numerous individual engagement points. Our platform captures deep signals of expressed interest throughout the entire event lifecycle. Firmographic, demographic, and interest data is gathered during the registration process before an event, and session registration, attendance, poll and live Q&A responses, chat, one-on-one appointments, and booth visits (among other engagement points) are gathered during the event. After an event concludes, event content can be promoted and viewed on-demand and survey results can be compiled on attendee feedback, interests, and preferences. Our platform scores, consolidates and shares attendee engagement data through integrations with CRM and marketing automation tools to help marketers enhance buyer profiles, obtain a clearer picture of attendee interest, and follow up more quickly and accurately with attendees, bolstering sales pipeline and aiding in client retention.
 
Internal events offer a critical opportunity for human resources, training professionals and executive leadership to inspire and engage their employees. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, organizations have a more distributed workforce, and we expect that trend to continue in the post-pandemic world. Organizations will be relying on companywide meetings, sales kickoffs, town halls and trainings more than ever in order to engage and retain employees who will now have fewer daily in-person interactions. We expect that internal meetings that remain virtual will be enhanced from non-specialized video chat software to something more branded, stylized, engaging and interactive, or organizations will solve the distributed workforce dilemma by opting to hold more in-person events. In either scenario, we believe there is an increased need for our Event Cloud solutions, which we believe offer increased attendee engagement that is vital to keeping an internal workforce aligned.
 
Whether for external events or internal meetings, we offer event and meeting organizers technology and services to help organizations execute and scale their event programs in a more cost- and resource-effective manner. In planning an event, our software helps planners manage the hundreds of manual, often repetitive, tasks that need to work in concert for a successful event, including event approvals and budgeting, venue sourcing and management, event marketing, attendee management, speaker and exhibitor management and video content creation.
    During an in-person event, our solutions enable planners to deliver elevated attendee and exhibitor experiences, including onsite check-in, badging, attendance tracking, appointments, mobile event apps and lead capture.
 
For virtual audiences, we enable planners to deliver an integrated, interactive virtual event experience that allows online audiences to connect with content, other attendees, exhibitors and sponsors. After events, our platform offers analytics and insights that allow planners to measure the impact of their events and improve future events. For many organizations, a Total Event Program may consist of hundreds or even thousands of meetings annually. Our Event Cloud provides the full picture of attendee interest, assembled from engagement interactions across all events, irrespective of format, with a single system of record utilizing standardized processes to manage each stage in the event lifecycle.
 

Event Marketing and Management Solutions
 
Our platform offers management of the end-to-end event lifecycle:
 


Planning
 
Strategic Meetings Management
 
We offer our Strategic Meetings Management (“SMM”), solution for customers with large, complex event programs. Our SMM solution is intended to help organizations manage their internal and external meetings program more efficiently, control spend and capture previously untracked meeting expenditures.
 
Our SMM solution enables organizations to centrally collect meeting requests, route and track approvals, and manage budgets, housing and travel and reporting in a single system, consolidating all elements associated with their event and travel programs. This information is critical to providing planners and procurement teams with better visibility into and control of event spend. Centralizing meeting, event and attendee data also allows enterprises to lower the risk of the in-person portions of their programs. By providing rapid access to critical event program data, organizations can more quickly respond to unforeseen disruptions and safeguard their attendees, employees and revenue.
 
Venue Sourcing
 
We offer multiple venue sourcing networks that allow planners to find the right event space.
 
The largest of our networks is CSN, which is a comprehensive and searchable global marketplace connecting over 90,000 planners to over 290,000 hotels and venues as of December 31, 2021. Planners can access CSN generally at no cost and can quickly search for venues based on meeting space-specific search criteria, including health, safety and floorplan information. Planners can send a single electronic RFP to multiple properties at once and receive standardized proposals in return, vastly simplifying the sourcing process and providing visibility into total meeting and event spend in order to negotiate the most competitive rates.
 
We believe that CSN is the world’s largest network dedicated to hotels and venues that host meetings and events. The total unique RFP meeting value submitted through our sourcing networks for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $9.1 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. We believe the smaller than usual increase in RFP value sourced for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a direct result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Venue Diagramming
 
Venue Diagramming is a collaborative venue diagramming and seating solution, providing planners with three-dimensional venue diagrams and interactive floor plans to design event layouts that optimize attendee health, safety and networking. Planners can

also use our solution prior to the event and during the registration process to easily manage attendee seating to help execute a smooth and successful onsite event experience.
 
Speaker Management
 
Our Speaker Management solution offers advanced content management capabilities that help marketers and planners source, review, select and manage the right content and speakers for their events. Marketers solicit submissions via web and email, customize a review process, accept or reject submissions and publish accepted content to an agenda, website, virtual experience and mobile event app.
Promotion
 
Event Marketing
 
Our Event Marketing solution provides event organizers with tools to plan and promote their events, attract prospective audiences and increase event attendance at their virtual, in-person and hybrid events. We offer promotion tools that allow marketers and planners to execute targeted and personalized email campaigns that engage the right audience, boost response rates and drive attendees to virtual, in-person and hybrid events. Our solution includes automated invites, reminders, and confirmations to drive both increased registration and attendance rates. Our solution also includes extensive creative controls to design seamlessly branded email campaigns, widgets and other digital assets.
Exhibitor Management
 
Our Exhibitor Management solution helps sponsors and exhibitors promote their presence and connect with attendees at hybrid, virtual and in-person events, while also enabling planners to coordinate and manage sponsors and exhibitors at their events. Our solutions allow event organizers to create tasks and automate emails to drive behavior that will increase an exhibitor’s value at their event. Through a self-serve portal, exhibitors can register their booth staff, manage their organization’s profile and add product videos, sales collateral and content. Using our solution, exhibitors can purchase Lead Capture licenses for booth staff and request meetings with qualified buyers using Appointments. Our solution provides real-time reporting on leads gathered during and after the event, which exhibitors can export into their CRM and Marketing Automation system for post-event activation.
Registration
 
Our Event Registration solution enables customers to easily build professional, branded event websites that convert visitors into registrants. An intuitive, drag and drop interface allows individuals to develop robust event websites without requiring HTML expertise or IT involvement. Event websites built with our solutions are fully responsive, enabling invitees to register easily from any device.
 
Our newly redesigned online Event Registration solution allows for a high degree of customization over the registration workflow, allowing for a differentiated experience for each distinct attendee type, including customers, prospects, partners, VIPs, members, non-members, exhibitors and students. Event organizers can configure the registration experience to include pre-populated contact information fields, pre- and post-event survey questions, a group registration option, session selection, housing and travel requests or bookings and event registration fee payment processing.
 
Day of Event
 
Virtual and Hybrid Experience
 
Attendee Hub
 
Attendee Hub, our solution for virtual and hybrid events, allows marketers and planners to deliver interactive and engaging virtual and hybrid event experiences. Our Attendee Hub solution enables organizations to deliver compelling online event experiences in a virtual-only use-case, or use the same technology to create hybrid events that extend in-person events to a global, online audience. Our solution enables organizations to showcase a consistent, fully branded experience and create and broadcast compelling video content from the invitation to the event website, and into the virtual experience itself.
 
By harnessing the most rewarding aspects of face-to-face gatherings and reproducing them for online audiences, the Attendee Hub delivers what we believe is constant engagement for attendees, exhibitors and sponsors. These capabilities include:
 

•A branded “virtual event lobby” that provides easy access to key event details, live and upcoming sessions and surveys;
 •Immersive and interactive virtual sessions with enterprise-grade live or pre-recorded video, including on-demand offerings;
 •A video production solution, Cvent Studio, which enables event planners to easily capture and produce broadcast-quality video content, whether live or pre-recorded, for more engaging webinars and virtual events;
 •Video conferencing capabilities to support collaborative sessions, virtual appointments and virtual meeting rooms;
 •Powerful interactivity features including polling, live session Q&A, and chat;
 •Gamification to encourage attendees to stay engaged by awarding them points for taking actions, such as joining a session, submitting feedback or visiting a virtual booth;
 •Virtual roundtable discussions that connect attendees and enable them to network with one another; and
 •Collected real-time feedback via session surveys.
    The Attendee Hub addresses a significant limitation in the virtual event space by offering powerful brand awareness and lead generation tools to exhibitors and sponsors who are often key sources of event revenue. The tools include virtual booths with embedded video conferencing to allow exhibitors to share relevant company and product information (allowing an attendee to self-schedule virtual meetings with exhibitors and instantly share their contact information), lead generation functionality and the ability to sponsor sessions.
 
The Attendee Hub also captures and stores virtual event and attendee data in a single location, allowing marketers and planners to analyze the extensive volume of data that comes from virtual engagement to better understand attendee interests. Our solution features powerful web analytics, survey capabilities and engagement scoring that provides sales and marketing teams a single, simple and actionable view of attendee activity.
 
We also offer virtual event services to help organizations project manage the setup and configuration of their virtual event, provide production and video editing services to deliver dynamic and professional-grade content and provide webcast and speaker support to ensure virtual speakers are prepared and supported.

Onsite Solutions
 
OnArrival, the core of our Onsite Solutions offering, includes check-in and badging that allow organizations to quickly check-in attendees, individually or as groups, collect signatures and process outstanding payments. We offer both planner-administered check-in and kiosk-based self-check-in processes, including the option for fully contactless check-in and badge printing to meet increased attendee expectations for health and safety.
 
We offer tools that allow onsite staff to quickly and easily check attendees in to sessions by scanning badges in order to capture attendance, monitor room capacity, control or limit access and track continuing education credits. This same attendance data is fed into our reporting system, allowing marketers and planners to digitize the physical footprint of an in-person attendee and to gain valuable insights into event and attendee-level content preferences.
 
For larger or more complex events, we offer OnArrival 360, a service providing end-to-end onsite project management support to ensure event success. Through this service, specialists assist onsite staff with badges, floor plan set up for attendee check-in, setup and configuration of onsite check-in hardware, and oversight of the organizer’s onsite registration staff.
 
Mobile Event App
 
Our solution enables event organizers to offer a native event app to all attendees, which can be accessed via the Apple App Store, Google Play Store or the web. From the mobile event app, attendees are able to access the agenda and speaker roster, manage their personal schedule, watch streamed content, engage through polls and questions, network with others via chat and appointments, and engage with sponsors and exhibitors, among other activities. Additionally, the app can be leveraged for in-person, virtual or hybrid events. In a hybrid event experience, in-person attendees leveraging the app onsite would enjoy the same features and capabilities that a virtual attendee would experience from a desktop environment.
Appointments
 
Our Appointments solution facilitates meetings between attendees, employees, sponsors, and exhibitors, allowing them to make more connections, effectively network and foster deeper relationships. Planners can set rules and parameters around who can meet with whom, when, and where. Appointments also has a powerful recommendation engine that leverages attendee profile data to surface like-minded attendees to help make finding new connections seamless. Our solution integrates directly with attendees’ calendar clients such as Microsoft Outlook or Gmail to ensure calendars are always in sync and up-to-date.
Lead Capture
 
Our Lead Capture solution provides organizations with a single lead retrieval tool across all of their events, including those they host and those they attend. Our solution enables organizations to significantly increase event-related lead volume and conversion through standardization, more widespread staff adoption and improved qualification as compared to manual or disparate solutions. For events an organization hosts, Lead Capture allows exhibitors and sponsors to quickly and easily capture, qualify and rate leads for fast follow up and increased ROI, making those partners more likely renew their investment in future events. For events an organization attends, the same solution used across events and tradeshows enables faster and consistent collection of leads, and timelier and more informed sales follow-up.
 
Post-Event
 
Lead Conversion
 
Our Lead Conversion capabilities calculate an engagement score for each attendee per event and compiles all engagement points throughout the event lifecycle, providing event marketers with one ranked set of attendees by engagement score across both virtual and in-person channels. Sales and marketing teams can leverage the attendee engagement scores to quickly assess interest, prioritize leads and do targeted follow-up activities. Our solution features integrations with CRM and marketing automation platforms to seamlessly share event and attendee data to recommend the optimal actions. Our solution includes native integrations with Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle Eloqua, HubSpot, and Microsoft Dynamics, and is also capable of connecting to any web-based program through APIs and webhooks. Our solution’s Salesforce integration is different from our competitors’ offerings in that it empowers sales teams to drive event attendance by inviting or registering their customers and prospects directly from within Salesforce, mitigating the need for marketing teams to interface with sales to coordinate invite lists, promotions, and discounts.
Event Insights
 
Our Event Insights solution captures and analyzes event and engagement data across virtual, in-person and hybrid events, enabling organizations to assess success and follow up on attendee interests quickly and effectively. Our platform includes more than 100 built-in reports that offer marketers and planners deep insight into the performance of their individual events. These insights enable planners to continually improve performance and provide marketing and sales teams a clear, complete picture of attendee interest. Our solution enables organizations to collect feedback on attendee and exhibitor satisfaction with tools for registration surveys, session polling, live Q&A, live chat and post-event surveys. In addition to delivering actionable insights from a single event, our solution provides organizations with a single source of data across their entire Total Event Program. Cross-event reporting and analytics compare results by region, business purpose, seasonality, venue type and other metrics, in order to provide insight into which events are most effective in meeting event goals.
Hospitality Cloud
 
Our Hospitality Cloud provides hotels, venues and destinations, which we refer to collectively as Suppliers, with robust online marketing solutions for marketing their events business to planners and software solutions that automate the events sales cycle and improving collaboration with planners to design and manage events.
Hospitality Cloud Online Marketing Solutions
 
Our platform enables suppliers to advertise and market on our venue sourcing networks to reach and engage tens of thousands of meeting and event planners who are researching destinations and venues for their in-person and hybrid events. Our venue sourcing networks include CSN, Cvent SpeedRFP and Cvent Wedding Spot.
 

CSN Advertising
 
CSN, the largest of our venue sourcing platforms, allows planners to filter, search and research a database of over 290,000 individual hotel and venue profiles as of December 31, 2021 to determine which venues to send an event RFP. CSN features comprehensive venue coverage and content, strong search functionality, side-by-side venue comparison tools and RFP management capabilities. With over 90,000 active planners that have access as of December 31, 2021, we believe CSN aggregates the largest planner audience looking for meeting venues with billions of dollars in meeting and event demand.
 
Our large planner audience makes CSN a compelling “point of purchase” marketing channel for suppliers, who can engage planners to drive awareness, consideration and selection of their venues for meetings and events. Hotel properties, chains and brands, as well as venues and destinations, purchase search advertising, display advertising, custom-branded microsites and other marketing opportunities to increase their visibility on CSN and influence planner venue selection.
 
Cvent SpeedRFP Advertising
 
Our SpeedRFP.com venue sourcing network helps event professionals and occasional planners to source venues for business and social events. We enable hotels and other suppliers to advertise and market to these event buyers on SpeedRFP.com.
Cvent Wedding Spot Advertising
 
Our Wedding-Spot.com website allows couples and wedding planners to source venues for weddings. Hotels and other event venues advertise and market to these couples and planners on our website in order to grow their wedding business.
Whitelabel
 
Suppliers also market to event organizers via their own websites by using our Whitelabel Sourcing Solutions. These solutions include Whitelabel Search and RFP and Interactive Floorplans.
 
Whitelabel Search and RFP
 
Our Whitelabel Search and RFP solutions enable hotels and venues to provide the same sourcing experience as our venue sourcing networks on their own websites. These Whitelabel Search and RFP solutions can power websites of the largest corporate hotel brands as well as websites run by individual hotels. By participating on our venue sourcing networks and using Whitelabel Search and RFP products, our platform enables hotels and venues to aggregate and respond to RFPs received via our venue sourcing network and their own website.
 
Interactive Floorplans
 
Our Interactive Floorplans solution enables a venue to present interactive floorplans on their own website that provides planners visibility into details of event space, including how meetings rooms are connected, room capacity, and available layouts.
Hospitality Cloud Software Solutions
 
Our Hospitality Cloud also offers hotels, destinations and venues software solutions to automate and improve how they sell and execute events.
 
Cvent Lead Scoring
 
Our Cvent Lead Scoring solution enables hotel sales staff to evaluate and prioritize event RFPs. With our solution, hotel sales management can make smart decisions about the attractiveness of a potential event and the appropriate level of investment to compete for that business.
CSN Business Intelligence
 
Our CSN Business Intelligence solution enables hotel sales teams to better understand their metrics and performance against internal benchmarks, goals and competing venues. Our solution can help management assess the performance of a given property or portfolio of properties by providing a view of how competitive properties or venues are performing in attracting and responding to RFPs and winning business in the same general event business climate.
Cvent Event Diagramming
 
Our Cvent Event Diagramming solution enables hotels to offer three-dimensional digital site tours and work collaboratively online with planners using diagramming tools to experiment with room layouts, and ensure desired seating arrangements and required safety protocols are taken into account. Our solution allows suppliers to virtually show how its space can accommodate the particular needs of the planner for that event and enables suppliers and planners to work together to make adjustments and optimize the space.
Cvent Passkey
 
Our Cvent Passkey solution allows hotels and planners to work in concert to manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events. Our solution offers greater efficiency, better personal data security and management, real-time updates of room block data in hotel systems, enhanced online room booking experiences for hotel guests and opportunities for the hotel to sell additional amenities to guests online during room selection.
 
While the solution is primarily used by hoteliers, we also directly offer Cvent Passkey to event organizers that are either managing city-wide events that require complex room block management across multiple hotels or looking to offer a more seamless and autonomous process for their attendees to book rooms against the contracted room block.
 
Cvent Business Transient
 
Our Cvent Business Transient solution enables suppliers to manage and respond to the transient RFPs corporate travel buyers issue through the platform. Our solution includes business intelligence tools to help hotels determine which RFPs to pursue and how to optimize their bid, as well as rate and content management tools to manage their participation in corporate hotel programs. While this solution is primarily used by hoteliers, we also offer Cvent Business Transient to corporate travel managers to source, negotiate, benchmark and audit corporate hotel rates with preferred hotel partners to better manage and optimize their corporate travel programs.
The Network Effect
 
We believe one of our differentiators in the marketplace is our ability to not only drive live engagement and be a system of record for an organization’s Total Event Program as outlined above, but also to power an entire meetings and events ecosystem through our sourcing networks. Market-leading enterprise software platforms that drive standardized processes have proven to be very “sticky” because organizations learn how to routinely automate complex processes that were previously chaotic to manage. However, networks that compound in value as more participants are added to the network, have proven to be even stickier. The consistent growth of CSN for sourcing event space sets us apart in the industry, and we believe the expected growth in RFP volume, planners sourcing on the network and the numbers of venues on CSN itself post-COVID-19 pandemic, will only continue to drive adoption of the Cvent platform and our sourcing networks within the meetings and events world.
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our platform primarily through direct sales, which comprises field sales representatives and inside sales personnel, organized by customer account size (enterprise and mid-market organizations) and customer geography across North America, Europe and APAC.
Sales Team Model
 
We sell our platform globally through a direct sales model, which is comprised of field and inside sales personnel. In the Event Cloud, we have dedicated teams that focus on different segments of the market: Enterprise, Mid-Market Corporate, Mid-Market Government, Association, Non-Profit, Education, or GANE, and Third-Party Partners. Within each team, there are four tiers that guide our representatives’ seniority, size of territory, and annual quota. In the Hospitality Cloud, we have the following distinct teams: Strategic Accounts, Territory and Unique Venues. The sales model for both Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud is the same. Direct Sales Representatives, or DSRs, serve as hunters and bring in new business. Sales Development Representatives, or SDRs, work alongside the DSRs and set appointments for qualified buyers. We also have a team of Solutions Consultants that assist both the DSRs and account managers in sharing more technical aspects of our platform with buyers. After new business is closed, it is passed over to Account Managers who serve as farmers and are responsible for renewal, account retention and upselling and cross-selling additional volume and solutions. We believe we still have massive remaining wallet share to capture within our installed base of customers. Our sales team is dispersed across North America, with the majority located in the Washington, DC area and additional sales teams in the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, we employ sales personnel in Australia, Spain, the Netherlands and Germany. Our sales team predominantly generates business through inbound leads generated by our marketing team, complemented by proactive outbound efforts into top accounts. We are rigorous regarding tracking our sales activity and our sales process with both prospects and clients. Every step of the sales process is accounted for within our accounts and opportunities in our CRM and configure, price and quote applications.
Our Marketing Approach
 
We have been continually evolving our approach to marketing for more than two decades, with a focus on building brand awareness and generating high quality sales leads. We combine our rigorous grassroots marketing approach built on a finely-tuned event and email marketing program with a strong digital marketing program built around thought leadership and content distribution to maximize engagement and interest in our solutions. In addition to these foundational elements of our marketing approach, our program includes:
 •sponsoring and participating in user conferences, trade shows and industry events;
 •customer advocacy marketing;
 •public relations efforts; and
 •social media marketing.
 
We host our marquee event technology conference, Cvent CONNECT, each year in the United States and in Europe. With thousands of attendees, compelling keynote speakers from across the industry, numerous networking sessions, and an industry tradeshow, we believe these events set the agenda in the event technology space. Cvent CONNECT helps us excite prospects, deepen relationships with customers and grow the Cvent brand. Starting in 2021, we began hosting our Cvent CONNECT conferences as hybrid events, and our Cvent CONNECT program will continue to play a critical role in our sales and marketing efforts.
 
Our inbound/outbound marketing approach scales globally and is designed to engage our audience, share customer best practices, build increasing interest in our solutions, and ultimately create a marketing qualified lead that is then sent to our sales teams for qualification. We track and measure our marketing costs and results closely across all channels in order to maximize our efforts and build our sales pipeline.
 
Partnerships and Industry Associations
 
Our go-to-market objectives include building our brand by expanding the Cvent ecosystem through a network of partnerships and driving growth through channel partners. We have established partnerships across three primary areas:
Meetings, Travel, Conference and Event Management Companies
 
We have established partnerships with the largest event, meeting and travel management companies, including American Express Business Travel, BCD Meetings & Events, HelmsBriscoe, ConferenceDirect and Maritz Travel. Additionally, we signed a strategic partnership with Encore, a global leader for white-glove event production services. These organizations use us as part of their services to their customers, including event management, sourcing, housing and virtual solutions, and have long-term agreements with us to promote our solutions to their customers. As of December 31, 2021, we also have approximately 1,400 smaller agencies and management companies globally that use and promote us as their primary event marketing and management, and sourcing solution, such as Balboa Travel, Meetings & Incentives and AdTrav Travel Management. These partnerships help expand our footprint globally to reach more customers and expand the utilization of our technology.
Technology Providers
 
We have built partnerships with leading industry technology providers such as Salesforce, Concur, American Express and MasterCard that complement, enhance, and extend our solutions. These partnerships include joint integrations and referral agreements. These strategic relationships help our customers maximize the value from their meeting and event programs through a seamless integration with our platform.
Leading Industry Associations
 
We also partner with many leading associations in both the meetings and hospitality industries, including Meeting Professionals International, Global Business Travel Association and American Marketing Association. We work with these influential industry organizations by providing them access to our technology, including complimentary training and certification to their members, in exchange for co-marketing benefits to our target buyers. These marketing benefits include attending and speaking at their industry events, distributing our content to their member base and hosting thought leadership sessions for their members. Since these industry partners and their smaller chapters are our customers, we believe that aligning ourselves with these organizations gives us strong market and brand credibility in addition to showcasing our solutions to a potential audience of tens of thousands of event, meeting and travel professionals.
Our Technology
 
We deliver our solutions using an internally developed cloud-based software-as-a-service model. Our cloud-based delivery model limits involvement from our clients’ technical teams and reduces implementation time and costs. We have developed a multi-tenant architecture and a secure, scalable and highly available technology platform that provides a high degree of flexibility to allow each customer to configure the business process workflow, branding and user interface to best meet their needs.
 
The architecture, design, deployment and management of our cloud-based platform are focused on the following:
 
Multi-Tenant Architecture. Our multi-tenant architecture enables all customers to be on the same version of our solutions. When we improve existing functionality, all customers receive the benefit of the new version at the same time.
 
Secure, Scalable and Highly Available Cloud Technology Platform. Our customers often rely on our solutions for their most important and largest meetings and events whether virtual, in-person, or both. To meet their demanding expectations, we designed an enterprise-grade, cloud-based technology platform that is secure, scalable and highly available. We regularly review the key facets of our platform and make improvements and enhancements to keep pace with growth, technology evolution and the evolving needs of our customers.
 
Scalability. We designed our software and systems to handle substantial growth in users and data without requiring significant re-engineering. For example, our event marketing and management solutions processed over three times as many registrations in 2021 as compared to 2013.
 
Security. Our security program is designed to strengthen the trust of our customers, employees and investors. A compliance mindset underpins our technology foundation, and we believe we are a leader in the meetings and events industry in terms of certifications. We maintain compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”), and certifications with the International Information Security Standard (“ISO”) 27001, the Service Organization Control (“SOC”) 1 and SOC 2. Furthermore, our security program continually invests in training its engineers on secure coding practices. In addition, regular penetration tests are conducted to identify and remediate any potential vulnerabilities along with a bounty program to identify areas for further improvements.
 
Availability and Redundancy. We have two hosting regions architected to offer scaling, redundancy and disaster/recovery as a part of our standard offering. In 2020, we achieved an uptime of greater than 99.9% across all regions and products. North America is the largest region with 100% operating on a single cloud-service platform. Europe is hosted 100% from a cloud-service platform in Ireland and Germany. We maintain 24 hours per day, seven days per week, operations with automated instrumentation and alerting, and a global workforce to accommodate any potential business continuity concerns.
 
Data Privacy. The changing regulatory environment regarding protecting the personal data of our customers and their event stakeholders is increasingly becoming a key focus point for our business. Our platform includes features and options designed to support compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other United States and international privacy laws, and provides options and features to enable customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align with their needs and relevant legal requirements. For example, our

platform enables customers to implement tailored notice, opt-out and consent language and customize registration forms to help customers remain compliant with applicable privacy laws. Additionally, our platform has built-in solutions to facilitate compliance with data subject requests. These solutions allow us to obtain and maintain certifications with the ISO 27701 and the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules and Privacy Recognition for Processors.
 
Our Customers
 Our Event Cloud Customers
 Meetings and events are prevalent in organizations of almost every size, industry vertical and geography. Our Event Cloud customers include corporations of all sizes, associations, non-profits, universities, governmental entities and others, along with third-party planners. External events represent opportunities for enterprises to directly engage with their most important external audiences – i.e., for corporations, their prospects and customers; for associations, their members and exhibitors; for non-profits, their donors and sponsors and for universities, their students and alumni. From an employee engagement perspective, internal events provide a critical opportunity for HR, training professionals, and executive leadership to teach, inspire and motivate their employees.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers, including 50% of the Fortune 500. As a group, revenue from the Event Cloud customers who are in the Fortune 500 represented 13.6% and 12.0% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the Event Cloud, we define a customer as a party who has entered into an active separate subscription contract with us. The majority of customers represent individual organizations. In certain cases, business units of a customer that have entered into separate subscription agreements with us are considered separate customers.
 We also have over 90,000 active user meeting and event organizers with access to CSN as of December 31, 2021, some of which also have a paid subscription to our other solutions. We consider a user to be active if such user accessed their account within 12 months preceding the date of measurement.
 Our customers come from a wide variety of vertical markets in the corporate sector including consumer products, financial services, healthcare, insurance, pharmaceutical, retail, technology, telecommunications, travel and leisure. We also have customers in the association, nonprofit, higher education, and government sectors. In each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no Event Cloud customer represented 1.0% or more of our revenue for that year.
Our Hospitality Cloud Customers
 As of December 31, 2021, more than 10,000 hotels, venues and destinations purchased products from our Hospitality Cloud through annual or multi-year contracts. In the Hospitality Cloud, we define a customer as an entity with an active account with us, where the customer pays for the account or the account is paid for by the customer’s parent company. For example, a corporate brand’s individual hotel properties whose accounts are paid for by that property’s corporate brand would be considered separate customers.
 In each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no Hospitality Cloud customer represented more than 1.0% of our revenue for that year.
In addition to the paid relationships with hotels, venues and destinations, we have direct integrations with the back-end sales and catering and IT systems of over 40,000 individual hotel properties, including many major hotel chains and brands.
 Below is a breakdown of our total Event Cloud, Hospitality Cloud, and aggregate customers. Customers are not unique to a cloud, and thus some customers appear in the counts of both the Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud:
 

 | As of December 31 | 
Customer Count | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Event Cloud | | 10,735 | | 12,018 | | 13,006
Hospitality Cloud | | 10,311 | | 13,883 | | 14,102
Overall | | 20,592 | | 25,532 | | 26,725

Our Competition
 We operate in an intensely competitive market that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Our biggest competitor is existing manual, paper and spreadsheet-based systems or point solutions for just a specific part of the event management and marketing process that organizations utilize by themselves in a fragmented manner. We believe the digitization of the industry and the need for driving and capturing engagement to understand attendee interests provides the greatest opportunity to grow our business. Other competition arises from:


•small and large event technology providers that compete with one or some of the components of our platform, such as event marketing, consumer ticketing, registration management, onsite solutions, mobile event apps and venue sourcing and booking;
 •providers that exclusively offer point solutions for hosting events;
 •in-house developed solutions that are difficult to maintain and do not integrate into marketing automation or CRM systems;
 •meeting and event management firms that offer their own custom-built event technology or leverage other commercial tools to run events for organizations of all sizes;
 •venue searches and bookings processed by phone or email, and budget and expense through spreadsheets;
 •online group sourcing and booking solutions, including group buying websites, consolidators and wholesalers of meeting products and services, and search websites; and
 •hotel and venue direct websites and their call centers that provide direct sourcing and booking solutions.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 •breadth and depth of feature set;
 •pricing;
 •user experience;
 •financial viability;
 •industry expertise;
 •proven customer references;
 •global client support and implementation services;
 •scalability and security;
 •privacy and industry-specific compliance with regulations;
 •integration into other enterprise software solutions; and 
 •terms and commissions for direct booking.
 We believe that we generally compete favorably with our competitors because of the comprehensive platform we have built specifically for marketers and planners (our Event Cloud) and hoteliers and venues (our Hospitality Cloud). Our cloud-based platform provides both broad and deep capabilities enabling organizations to use one overall solution instead of relying on multiple point products that may not integrate well together.
 Client Services
 We believe that our award-winning client services solidify our reputation as an industry leader. Our client services are essential to onboarding new customers and a primary reason customers renew their contracts. With staff and infrastructure already established in several countries and offering a mix of service levels and premium services offerings, our Client Services function is well positioned to provide scalable and global customer services for in-person, virtual and hybrid events.
 Our global Client Services organization is comprised of four groups—Customer Support, Client Success, Professional Services and Customer Training—that together help ensure our customers derive maximum value from their use of our solutions. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 1,300 employees in our Client Services organization working from locations in the United States, Canada, UK, Australia and India.
 Our Customer Support organization supports in-person, virtual and hybrid events, is available to our event, mobile and conference management subscription customers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and can be contacted via telephone, online chat and web form during the subscription period. Our Client Success teams work closely with our clients to ensure successful onboarding and

help drive maximum platform adoption. Our Professional Services teams provide paid services for clients across a number of areas critical to successful events including advanced production for virtual events, web site creation, graphic design, mobile application creation, implementation services and onsite support for in-person and hybrid events. Our Customer Training team designs and facilitates online and in-person training sessions to help with platform adoption.
 As a complement to our people-based services, we have created an online community available to all of our customers, called the Cvent Community. The primary function of the Cvent Community is to provide an online ecosystem for our customers to discuss best practices for using our platform, ask questions and share ideas with other customers and our support team. The Cvent Community includes a multitude of industry trainings to assist in educating our customer base. Additionally, by actively supporting and soliciting input from customers using the Cvent Community, we believe we have created a valuable feedback loop through which our application development teams gain insights about potential new features and functions that guide our future development efforts. In addition, through our established customer advisory boards, our customers can gain deeper insight into our application roadmap. We further actively support the sharing of best practices and information across our community by providing collaboration and communication tools such as a shared library of development tools and templates, discussion forums and blogs written by our application and customer service experts. With all of the Community’s resources and conversations focused on a single version of our software, any enhancements developed can benefit the entire community.
 Research and Product Development
 Our Research and Development effort is focused both on developing new software and on improving our existing products to transform the meetings and events industry and deliver live engagement. Our Product Development team closely monitors market needs and works closely with customers to identify their current and future requirements. As of December 31, 2021, over 1,100 employees work on our research and development team, which represents 26.2% of our employee base.
 We believe that constant innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our customers and improving our competitive position through platform expansion and differentiation. We supplement our own research and development effort with technologies and products that we license from third parties. We test our products thoroughly to certify and ensure interoperability with third-party hardware and software products. Our U.S. and India personnel develop our products on a nearly continual basis all year long.
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our research and development expenses totaled $96.6 million and $87.9 million, respectively, representing 18.6% and 17.6% of Cvent’s gross revenue, respectively. We plan to continue to significantly invest resources for our research and development efforts, especially to accelerate our event marketing and management solutions for virtual and hybrid events.
 Intellectual Property
 Our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property, including our technology, is and will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We primarily protect our intellectual property through trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and contractual restrictions. However, these legal and contractual protections may provide only limited protection. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property incorporated into our software solutions. We are not materially dependent upon these third-party providers.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned 39 registered U.S. trademarks, 25 pending U.S. trademark application, 124 registered non-U.S. trademarks and 30 pending non-U.S. trademark applications, including registered trademarks for “CVENT,” “CVENT CONNECT”,“ATTENDEEHUB”, “ATTENDEE JOURNEY” and “ONARRIVAL”. We pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe doing so would be beneficial to our competitive position. Despite our efforts, the actions we take to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from infringing, diluting, or otherwise harming our trademarks, and the laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our trademark rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned four issued U.S. and two issued non-U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications and six pending non-U.S. patent applications. The two issued non-U.S. patents expire in October 2029 and 2030, respectively. While these issued patents and pending patent applications protect some of our intellectual property, we are not materially dependent on any one or more of them.
 We have also established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies and other third parties with whom we conduct business.


Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying, reverse engineering, infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property, technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop services that compete with ours. Additionally, our intellectual property rights may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, narrowed in scope or rendered unenforceable. For important additional information related to our intellectual property position, please review the information set forth in “Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry” and “Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks.”
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 Our mission is to transform the meetings and events industry through technology that delivers live engagement across virtual, in-person, and hybrid events. We believe in connecting people globally through our solutions and services.
Cvent Culture
 Over the last 20 years, our innovative solutions can be attributed to our people and our culture. Simply put, the DNA of Cvent is our people. We have thrived and built a culture of empowerment, encouraging employees to think and act like entrepreneurs, or what we call “intrapreneurs;” to drive business and innovation and their passion has pushed us to become an industry leader. Our employees are guided by our core values called the Soul of Cvent, which include values such as taking actions that make good business sense; adapting, growing and being open to change in an industry that is driven widely by innovation; taking educated risks; and cultivating community by celebrating differences and building on shared connections.
 We’ve been recognized for multiple years in many reputable benchmark surveys such as the Best Places to Work in the US, UK and India, The Washington Post Top Workplaces and Stevie American Business Awards, among others.
 Global Reach and People
 Our headquarters are situated in Tysons, Virginia, the tech hub of the Washington, D.C. area. While our roots are in Northern Virginia, we pride ourselves on our global mindset with 20 offices across the U.S., Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East, which gives employees plenty of opportunities for growth. As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 4,300 total employees. The largest employee populations are based in two main locations—our headquarters office with approximately 750 employees, and our operations in Gurgaon, India, with approximately 2,100 employees. The remaining employees are strategically situated in offices and remote locations that enable us to service our customers. While we place great importance in collaboration, we will be evaluating our location strategy post-pandemic, which may result in divesting from our physical locations to ensure we are creating the right value proposition while keeping our workforce engaged and continue to service our clients.
 Our Human Capital Strategy is grounded in our people-first philosophy; as such, our employees’ opinions and sentiments are imperative to the programs and policies we practice. We consistently solicited employee feedback through an annual engagement survey, pulse surveys and hosting informal employee focus group meetings. We are a pro-employee organization and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never had a work stoppage, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good while continuing to build programs and offerings with an employee-centric approach.
 With respect to community engagement, we encourage employees to support their respective communities in multiple ways. We match donations made by employees to non-profit philanthropic programs, and we reward employees who volunteer their time in the community by giving personal time off through our Cvent Gives Back program. Throughout the year, employees of Cvent or its subsidiaries raise money and participate in group activities that create awareness through fund raising events, and Cvent matches dollars to these charitable organizations as well.
 Compensation and Benefits Program
 Our compensation package is designed to attract, motivate, reward, and retain top talent to drive our strategic key results and objectives. We provide all employees with a competitive total cash compensation package, which includes base salary plus an annual cash bonus to drive engagement and discretionary effort. We provide long-term incentives to employees at certain levels of the organization to engage them in long-term company success. It is offered in the form of equity with a graduated vesting period.


We invest in our employees by offering a wide range of benefits that help take care of each employee and their dependents. We offer a benefits package that focuses on work-life balance, healthy habits, and financial wellness. The package includes comprehensive health, vision, dental insurance programs, PTO days, sick leave, flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts, a 401(k) program, and an employee discount program. Our health and welfare program provides both choice and value to meet the needs of our diverse workforce.
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 We believe that the impact of our people practices goes beyond the walls of Cvent and indirectly translates to how we support our community, improves societal issues, and enhances the customer experience. For this reason, we are committed to and focused on creating an inclusive workplace where diversity initiatives are not just a program, but a way of doing business and building talent. Our diverse workforce is the engine of innovation, and we strive to integrate our end-to-end Human Resources processes with the lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our leadership has made diversity a top priority, and we are continuing to evaluate and improve our practices. Broadening our understanding started with unconscious bias training and creating transparency of our progress and commitments during our company-wide employee meeting.
 We have broadened the scope and accountability of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) to include employees at all levels of the organization. We have several Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), where we bring employees of Cvent or its subsidiaries together based on common life experiences, diverse backgrounds and passion to elevate issues of society and community. We presently have six ERGs, which represent the LGBTQIA+, female, Black, veteran, Jewish and working parent communities at the company. Representatives from each ERG participate in a company-wide committee called the Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Allyship and Storytelling (“IDEAS”) Council to collaborate and share ideas to improve our DEI efforts. Approximately 22% of our employees participate in one or more ERGs.
 Facilities
 We currently lease approximately 188,600 square feet of space for our corporate headquarters in Tysons, Virginia under a lease agreement that expires in July 2025. We also lease approximately 150,000 square feet of space for our Gurgaon, India office under a lease agreement that expires in December 2028. Both of these offices are used for administrative, marketing, support and development operations. In connection with our sales and product development efforts, we also lease office space in Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Draper, Utah; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Fredericton, Canada; Vancouver, Canada; Portland, Oregon and Singapore.
 We believe that our current facilities and planned expansion facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future; however, we will continue to seek additional space as needed to satisfy our growth. We also continue to invest in technology that allows our distributed workforce to work efficiently and effectively from remote locations.
 Government Regulation
 Although we do not believe that significant existing laws or government regulations adversely impact us, our business could be affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws, rules or regulations, future laws, rules or regulations or actions by domestic or foreign regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with these and other laws, rules and regulations may result in, among other consequences, administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, other litigation and significant civil and criminal liability.
Data Privacy, Protection and Security
 Businesses use our platform to facilitate, coordinate and plan in-person, virtual and hybrid meetings and events, and to streamline collaboration between meeting and event planners, hotels and venues. Accordingly, our platform collects, uses, stores, transmits, analyzes and otherwise processes information from and about both our own customers and prospective customers, as well as a business’s end customers and event attendees that interact with the business or its content on our platform. We utilize a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect our data and information, including personal data and other data pertaining to customers, employees and other users. Despite measures we put in place, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to such data, including personal data.


Compliance with laws, rules, regulations, policies, industry standards and other legal obligations regarding data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data breaches, and the collection, storage, transfer, use, analysis and other processing of personal data, which we refer to as privacy laws, are critical to our compliance and risk strategy. Globally, numerous jurisdictions have passed or are actively considering passing new or amended privacy laws. As a result, privacy laws are increasing in number, and with increased enforcement of these new laws the number of fines and other penalties have also increased. Beyond legislative developments, decisions by courts and regulatory bodies relating to privacy laws can also have a significant impact on us and other businesses that operate across international jurisdictions.
 In some cases, privacy laws apply directly to both us and our customers, and in other cases our customers pass through compliance obligations and requirements to us contractually. Further, under some privacy laws, we may be considered a “processor” or a “service provider” and our customers may be considered a “controller” or “business,” while other privacy laws may not clearly distinguish between such roles. In all cases, however, we must monitor, respond to and address privacy laws and related compliance, whether to ensure our own compliance or enable compliant use of our platform by our customers. In general, our failure to adequately safeguard data, address privacy compliance, or comply with our security and privacy commitments to customers could subject us, not only to significant contractual liability to customers and direct liability under privacy laws, but also to reputational harm and regulatory investigations, inquiries or enforcement actions under U.S. (federal and state) and international laws, rules and regulations relating to consumer protection and unfair business practices. Specifically, certain privacy law developments could have significant impacts to our platform and business. For example, privacy laws that restrict the use of personal information for marketing purposes or the tracking of individuals’ online activities (such as the EU’s proposed ePrivacy Regulation and the CCPA), could expose us to additional regulatory burdens or necessitate changes to our platform or certain features. In addition, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws that impose data localization requirements or cross border data transfer restrictions on certain data. As with most cloud-based solutions, restrictions on the transfer of platform data outside of the originating jurisdiction pose particular challenges that could result in additional costs or otherwise impact platform use.
 With the evolving legal landscape, the scope, interpretation and enforcement of privacy laws could change and new or amended laws may take effect. As a result, the associated burdens and compliance costs on us and our platform could increase in the future. Although we continue to monitor and respond to privacy legal developments and have invested in addressing major privacy law developments (such as the GDPR and the CCPA), it is not possible for us to predict with certainty the effect of these developments on our platform and business.
 Copyrights and Trademarks
 In the U.S., the Copyright Act of 1976, the Lanham Act and the statutes and regulations associated with copyrights and trademarks and enforced by the United States Copyright Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office are intended to protect the rights of third parties from infringement. Our customers and their users can generally use our platform to upload and present a wide variety of content. We follow a copyright infringement process and respond to takedown requests by third-party intellectual property right owners that might result from content uploaded to our platform. As our business expands to other jurisdictions, we must also respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including takedown and cease-and-desist notices in foreign languages, and we must build infrastructure to support these processes. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, also applies to our business. This statute provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright-protected technologies but includes a safe harbor that is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites or hosting content that infringes copyrights of others. The copyright infringement policies that we have implemented for our platform are intended to satisfy the DMCA safe harbor.
Accessibility
 Government authorities outside the U.S. may seek to restrict access to or block our service, prohibit or block the hosting of certain content available through our platform or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of our platform in that country for a period of time or even indefinitely. In addition, some countries have enacted laws that allow websites to be blocked for hosting certain types of content or may require websites to remove certain restricted content.
Consumer Protection
 In addition, we provide advertising data and information and conduct marketing activities that are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements and industry specific value-added tax regimes.
