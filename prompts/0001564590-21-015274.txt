Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for patients living with rare neurological disorders who have unmet medical needs. Our product, WAKIX (pitolisant), is a first-in-class molecule with a novel mechanism of action (“MOA”) specifically designed to increase histamine signaling in the brain by binding to H3 receptors. In August 2019, WAKIX was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (“EDS”) in adult patients with narcolepsy, and its U.S. commercial launch was initiated in November 2019. On October 13, 2020, WAKIX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. WAKIX is the first-and-only approved product for patients with narcolepsy that is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”).
 We plan to pursue label expansion for WAKIX in narcolepsy in pediatric patients and engage with the FDA in pursuit of pediatric exclusivity. We currently expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in pediatric patients in the second half of 2021 in pursuit of indications for both EDS and cataplexy. We believe that pitolisant’s ability to regulate histamine gives it the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in other rare neurological disorders that are mediated through H3 receptors and histamine signaling. We are initially focusing on evaluating WAKIX for the treatment of EDS associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (“PWS”) and myotonic dystrophy, otherwise known as dystrophia myotonica (“DM”). In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS and other key symptoms in patients with PWS and anticipate topline results in the first half of 2022. In January 2021, we opened an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for DM and are planning to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with DM1 in the first half of 2021, with topline results expected in the second half of 2022. Beyond these indications, we intend to further explore pitolisant in other rare neurological disorders, potentially including those in which fatigue and cognitive impairment are prominent symptoms with significant impact on daily functioning.
 We also seek to expand our pipeline through the acquisition of additional assets that focus on addressing the unmet needs of patients with neurological disorders.  We intend to target assets that will be complementary to WAKIX and our expanding list of potential new indications for WAKIX, and assets that will allow us to further leverage the expertise and infrastructure that we have successfully built at Harmony.
 Pitolisant was developed by Bioprojet and approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in 2016 for the treatment of narcolepsy in adult patients with or without cataplexy. We acquired an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize pitolisant in the United States pursuant to our license agreement with Bioprojet (as amended, the “Bioprojet License Agreement”) in July 2017. See “—Strategic Agreement—License and Commercialization Agreement with Bioprojet” for further information regarding the Bioprojet License Agreement. Pitolisant was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of narcolepsy by the FDA in 2010. It received Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy and Fast Track designation for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy in April 2018.
 Our operating subsidiary, Harmony Biosciences, LLC, was formed in May 2017. We were formed in July 2017 as Harmony Biosciences II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and we converted to a Delaware corporation named Harmony Biosciences II, Inc. in September 2017. In February 2020, we changed our name to Harmony Biosciences Holdings, Inc. Our operations to date have consisted of building and staffing our organization, acquiring the rights to pitolisant, raising capital, opening an IND for pitolisant in narcolepsy, initiating an Expanded 
 7


Access Program (“EAP”) for pitolisant for appropriate patients in the United States, preparing and submitting our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for pitolisant, gaining NDA approval for WAKIX for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy, and launching and commercializing WAKIX in the United States. In addition, we have opened INDs for both PWS and DM and have initiated or intend to initiate clinical development programs in PWS, DM and pediatric narcolepsy to pursue potential new indications for WAKIX. 
 Initial Public Offering
 On August 21, 2020, we completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock, in which we sold 6,151,162 shares, including 802,325 shares pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on August 19, 2020. The shares were sold at an IPO price of $24.00 per share for net proceeds of approximately $135.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $12.2 million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into shares of common stock and the accrued dividend payable to holders of the convertible preferred stock was paid out in shares of common stock, resulting in a total of 42,926,630 shares of common stock being issued to former holders of our convertible preferred stock, and warrants exercisable for convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for a total of 410,239 shares of common stock.
 Liquidity and Sources of Funding
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $159.7 million of net product revenues. We have financed our operations primarily with (a) proceeds from sales of our convertible preferred stock, (b) borrowings under (i) our Loan Agreement with CRG and (ii) our Credit Agreement with OrbiMed, and (c) proceeds from our IPO. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $229.4 million and an accumulated deficit of $488.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, of $194.3 million.
 We believe that our anticipated cash from operating and financing activities and existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to meet our operational liquidity needs and fund planned investing activities for the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. See “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Commercial Launch Metrics
 As of December 31, 2020, over 2,400 unique healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) (out of a total of approximately 8,000 HCPs who treat approximately 90% of diagnosed narcolepsy patients) have prescribed WAKIX since it became available in November 2019. The average number of patients on WAKIX at the end of 2020 was approximately 2,500. We have secured formulary access for approximately 80% of all insured lives (Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid) in the United States. Within these covered lives, we have observed favorable access to WAKIX subsequent to the expanded approval of WAKIX for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy in October 2020.
COVID-19 Business Update
 With the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a response strategy that includes establishing cross-functional response teams and implementing business continuity plans to manage the impact of the pandemic on our employees, patients, HCPs, and our business. 
 Despite our response strategy, the COVID-19 pandemic is having an effect on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general, and is impacting the way stakeholders interact with one another during this pandemic. We continue to leverage technology and virtual engagement initiatives to offset our reduced in-person access to HCPs. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to high unemployment and corresponding loss of medical insurance, has caused a change in relationship dynamics between patients and their HCPs and has impacted the way patients take, or do not take, their medication. Based on these factors, we expect that the revenue growth rate in future quarters may be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
We continue to identify new and innovative ways to maintain meaningful engagement, generate awareness and educate our patients, HCPs and payors to minimize the pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and support our commercial launch performance. 
 Commercialization
 With respect to our commercialization activities, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic is putting pressure on top-line prescription demand for WAKIX, primarily due to (i) our field sales team’s reduced ability to access HCPs in person, and (ii) fewer patients seeing HCPs for prescriptions or treatments. The impact on demand for WAKIX may also be related to a reduced ability of prescribers to diagnose narcolepsy patients given the limitations in access to sleep testing, the reduced ability to see patients due to (i) cancelled appointments and (ii) the reprioritization of healthcare resources toward the treatment of COVID-19, both of which lead to fewer prescriptions. Despite these challenges, we continue to engage and educate HCPs virtually on the overall benefit/risk profile of WAKIX and continue to provide support for people living with narcolepsy. As offices, clinics and institutions have begun to allow limited in-person interactions pursuant to health authority and local government guidelines, our field teams continue to re-initiate in-person interactions with HCPs and customers, but the timing 
 9


and level of engagement vary by account and region and may be adversely impacted in the future where reemergence or future outbreaks of COVID-19 may occur. 
 High unemployment and the corresponding loss of health insurance is causing some eligible patients to shift from commercial insurance to free goods and patient assistance programs, which impacts our ability to convert demand to revenue. Depending on the scale and ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of an economic slowdown, widespread unemployment and resulting loss of employer-sponsored insurance coverage, we may experience a shift from commercial payor coverage to government payor coverage or continued/increased demand for patient assistance and/or free drug programs, which could further impact our net revenue in the coming quarters.
 Supply Chain
 We currently expect to have adequate supply of WAKIX through the first half of 2022, with additional API on-hand inventory to support 12 to 18 months beyond this time frame. We are working closely with our third-party manufacturers, distributors and other partners to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions to our product supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our access to the required production lines to produce additional API and WAKIX finished product throughout the next 12-18 months will not be directly impacted by the potential need to reprioritize manufacturing resources due to the production of materials utilized for COVID-19 vaccines.
 Our manufacturing partners in France and the United States continue to be operational. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists for an extended period of time and/or begins to impact essential distribution systems such as transatlantic freight, FedEx, UPS and postal delivery, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations with associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our products.
 Research and Development
 The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the pharmaceutical industry’s ability to conduct clinical trials. While we initially experienced some challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken measures and put contingency plans in place in order to advance our clinical development programs. We have implemented remote and virtual approaches to clinical trials, including using telemedicine for remote clinic visits to perform efficacy assessments and sending out licensed HCPs to each patient to collect safety assessments (e.g. labs, electrocardiograms) as required by the protocols. We are also performing remote site visits and data monitoring where possible. These measures are being instituted with the intent of maintaining patient safety and trial continuity while preserving study integrity. One unique challenge we are facing is the ability to access sleep labs during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to conduct objective sleep testing, which is required for some of our clinical trials. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations (“CROs”) or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time, or reemerges in the future, we could experience significant delays in our clinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
Corporate Development and Other Financial Impacts
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of domestic and global financial markets. If the disruption persists and/or worsens, we may be unable to access additional capital, which could negatively affect our ability to execute on certain corporate development transactions or other important investment opportunities. The pandemic could also impact our ability to conduct in-person due diligence, negotiations, and other interactions to identify new opportunities.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected, and continues to affect, our business operations and financial results. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to generate sales of, and revenues from, our approved products, our clinical development and regulatory efforts, our corporate development objectives and the value of and market for our common stock, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of or reemergence of outbreaks, 
 10


governmental travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States, France, and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat COVID-19.
 Corporate Responsibility Impact
 We continue to provide support to our local communities, patient-focused organizations and other charitable organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic with relief efforts, including corporate donations, supplying food, medical supplies and other resources.  For the safety and well-being of our employees, consultants and their families, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have abided by government-issued work from home orders.  We continue to clean and sanitize our offices on a regular basis and have implemented COVID-19 screening procedures and social distancing guidelines before allowing employees or guests to enter our offices. 
Narcolepsy Market Overview 
 Narcolepsy is a rare, chronic and debilitating neurological disorder of sleep-wake state instability that is estimated to affect approximately 165,000 Americans, with fewer than 50% diagnosed. Narcolepsy is characterized by EDS, which is present in all patients with narcolepsy and is the primary reason why patients seek treatment. EDS is the inability to stay awake or alert throughout the day, including an irrepressible need for sleep, with lapses into drowsiness or sleep, which has a significant impact on a patient’s ability to function. Additional symptoms of narcolepsy may include cataplexy (which is characterized by sudden and transient episodes of muscle weakness accompanied by full conscious awareness), hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disrupted nighttime sleep. In most patients, narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin, a neuropeptide in the brain that, along with histamine, works to support sleep-wake state stability. This disorder affects men and women equally, with typical symptom onset in adolescence or young adulthood; however, it can take up to a decade after onset of symptoms to be properly diagnosed. The U.S. narcolepsy market had an approximate net sales value of $2.1 billion in 2020. The market is expected to continue to grow based on several factors, including, but not limited to, the introduction of new innovative therapies that offer novel mechanisms of action resulting in improved safety/tolerability profiles while delivering clinically meaningful efficacy, additional investment in education, increased rates of diagnosis, and population growth. 
 Prior to the FDA’s approval of WAKIX in 2019, there were six approved medications to treat patients with narcolepsy, all of which are scheduled as controlled substances, and no new therapies had been approved for narcolepsy patients in the United States since 2007. These medications include Xyrem (sodium oxybate), Provigil (modafinil), Nuvigil (armodafinil), Ritalin (methylphenidate), Adderall (amphetamine salts) and Sunosi (solriamfetol). Following the approval of WAKIX, in July 2020 the FDA approved a new lower sodium formulation of Xyrem (Xywav). These approved drugs are prescribed in accordance with their individual labels for indications covering narcolepsy, cataplexy and/or EDS related to narcolepsy, and have demonstrated the ability to improve the lives of the patients suffering from these symptoms. Other prescription drugs are used off-label for the treatment of either EDS or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy, including stimulants for EDS and antidepressants for cataplexy. Despite the benefits provided by the available medications, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (“AASM”), traditional stimulants, wake-promoting agents and sodium oxybate, at best, provide only moderate improvement in narcolepsy symptoms and side effects may limit their use. Some of the current therapies have significant side effects (such as increased heart rate and blood pressure) and boxed warnings due to the risk of respiratory depression, abuse and dependence. These therapies also have the potential for rebound and withdrawal symptoms. The Voice of the Patient report from the FDA’s patient-focused drug development initiative, published in 2014, concluded that, based on the overall benefit-risk assessment of current medications, there is a continued need for additional effective and tolerable treatment options for patients with narcolepsy. In a retrospective electronic chart review conducted by Rush University Medical Center from June 2011 to December 2018, over 75% (73 out of 97 respondents) of patients with narcolepsy reported at least one residual symptom while on their current treatment. In a third party survey that we commissioned prior to the commercialization of WAKIX, of the 200 patients with narcolepsy who were surveyed, 86% (173 out of 200 respondents) of patients reported narcolepsy is a life changing disorder and 93% (157 out of 169 respondents) expressed frustration with current treatment options, while 31 patients were not on treatment and, as such, did not provide a response to this question. The main drivers of patients’ dissatisfaction were side effects and tolerability, loss of efficacy over time and concerns about abuse and dependence with current therapies. 
 11


In market research sponsored by us prior to the commercial release of WAKIX, both patients and healthcare professionals (“HCPs”) expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with then-existing therapies, reflecting current unmet medical needs. These unmet needs included, in order of importance, the availability of: (i) non-scheduled treatment options, (ii) more tolerable treatment regimens, (iii) more effective treatment options, (iv) novel MOAs beyond currently available therapies and (v) once-daily treatment options. Based on our market research, we believe the most significant unmet need identified was the availability of non-scheduled treatment options. Other than WAKIX, all drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of narcolepsy, including stimulants, are scheduled as controlled substances by the DEA. Controlled substances have the potential for abuse, misuse, and diversion. In addition, these products also have the potential for the development of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Despite their inherent drawbacks, due to the limited number of treatment options, stimulants have historically been a primary treatment for people with narcolepsy. In addition to having the potential for abuse, all of the treatments approved for narcolepsy, except WAKIX, require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) program, which is required by the FDA for certain medications with serious safety concerns to help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks. 
 Our Solution 
 WAKIX (pitolisant) represents a novel approach to narcolepsy treatment. We believe that WAKIX offers a meaningfully differentiated product profile over current treatment options for the following reasons: 

• | First-in-class molecule with a novel MOA. WAKIX is the only selective H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist approved by the FDA. It is approved for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy and is the only narcolepsy treatment that works primarily through histamine, a major wake-promoting neurotransmitter. Pitolisant is thought to work by regulating histamine, such that it activates wake-promoting neurons and inhibits sleep promoting neurons, which helps to stabilize states of sleep and wakefulness. We believe that these novel characteristics differentiate it from other narcolepsy treatments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | First-and-only non-scheduled treatment for narcolepsy. WAKIX is the first-and-only FDA-approved treatment for narcolepsy that is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the DEA. We believe one of the most significant unmet needs is the availability of non-scheduled treatment options. In a clinical trial, pitolisant demonstrated statistically significantly lower drug liking compared to phentermine (a Schedule IV stimulant), consistent with its lack of abuse potential.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WAKIX is not a stimulant. Stimulants are one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for patients with narcolepsy. Unlike stimulants, in clinical trials, WAKIX has shown no evidence for the development of drug tolerance or withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, there is no need for patients to temporarily stop the medication to reset efficacy. In addition, unlike stimulants, WAKIX does not increase dopamine levels in the brain’s reward center, which contributes to its lack of abuse potential. According to the National Sleep Foundation, stimulants have the potential for abuse, so their use must be considered carefully by patients and HCPs. WAKIX gives patients and HCPs a different therapeutic option.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WAKIX can be used as monotherapy or administered concomitantly with other narcolepsy treatments. Narcolepsy is a difficult disorder to manage and the majority of narcolepsy patients often require multiple medications to treat their symptoms. WAKIX was studied in combination with each of modafinil and sodium oxybate (two common treatments for narcolepsy) and demonstrated no effect on the pharmacokinetic (“PK”) profile of either treatment, and neither treatment had a clinically relevant effect on the PK profile of WAKIX. We believe the ability of WAKIX to be taken as monotherapy or concomitantly with other narcolepsy medications affords HCPs the flexibility to better manage their patients with narcolepsy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WAKIX is a once-daily oral tablet administered in the morning upon wakening. Patients have identified a need for treatment options that are easier to take and are dosed less frequently. We believe that once-daily dosing with WAKIX addresses this need and may help improve patient compliance with treatment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy 
 12


Our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel treatment options for patients living with rare neurological disorders who have unmet medical needs, beginning with a focus on narcolepsy. The key elements of our strategy are outlined in our three pillars of growth:

• | Pillar I: Optimize the Commercialization of WAKIX in Adult Patients with Narcolepsy
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Commercialize WAKIX in the United States. We have assembled a team of approximately 150 professionals that possess comprehensive life sciences experience. We have also established a robust company infrastructure to execute on our core business and growth strategies. This team includes over 70 dedicated and experienced sales professionals who call on the approximately 8,000 HCPs who treat approximately 90% of narcolepsy patients in the United States. In November 2019, we launched commercial sales of WAKIX in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pillar II: Expand the Clinical Utility of WAKIX
--+------------------------------------------------


o | Expand WAKIX Label in Narcolepsy. Building upon the EDS and cataplexy indications in adult patients with narcolepsy, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in pediatric narcolepsy patients in the second half of 2021 with the goal of gaining a pediatric indication for both EDS and cataplexy. We also plan to engage with the FDA to pursue pediatric exclusivity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pursue New Indications Beyond Narcolepsy. We believe that pitolisant’s novel MOA offers a portfolio in a product opportunity and has therapeutic potential in several other patient populations with rare neurological disorders. We submitted an IND for PWS in October 2019 and received acknowledgement from the FDA that the proposed clinical investigation may proceed. We subsequently completed a Phase 1 PK clinical trial in pediatric patients with PWS in the fourth quarter of 2019, and initiated a long-term, open-label safety trial in these patients. In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS and other key symptoms in patients with PWS, including behavioral symptoms and cognitive impairment. Topline results from this clinical trial are expected in the first half of 2022. For patients with DM, we are planning to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS and other key symptoms, including fatigue and cognitive impairment. We submitted an IND for DM at the end of 2020 and the IND opened in January 2021, after which we received a “Study May Proceed” letter from the FDA in February 2021. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with DM1 during the first half of 2021 and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2022. We also plan to explore pitolisant’s potential as a treatment for EDS and related symptoms in other rare neurological disorders, potentially including those in which fatigue and cognitive impairment are prominent symptoms with significant impact on daily functioning.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pillar III: Acquire New Assets to Expand our Product Portfolio
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


o | Explore Expansion of our Product Portfolio. As we continue our commercial growth and the advancement of our clinical development programs with pitolisant, a key component of our strategy will be to expand our product portfolio beyond pitolisant by partnering, co-developing or acquiring assets focused on rare neurological disorders and/or other disorders with unmet medical needs that are complementary to our existing research and development expertise and/or commercial footprint.

Our History 
 Our operating subsidiary, Harmony Biosciences, LLC, was formed in May 2017. We were formed in July 2017 as Harmony Biosciences II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and we converted to a Delaware corporation named Harmony Biosciences II, Inc. in September 2017. In February 2020, we changed our name to Harmony Biosciences Holdings, Inc. 
 Since inception, we have raised approximately $493 million in equity financing. We have assembled an experienced leadership team with a track record of developing and commercializing products to treat rare neurological disorders. We believe that the clinical development, regulatory, commercial, and operational expertise of our executive and senior leadership team will be essential as we execute on our strategy of becoming a leading pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of rare neurological disorders while delivering significant value to both patients and shareholders. 
 Overview of Development Pipeline 
 Label Expansion 
 While all patients with narcolepsy have the primary symptom of EDS, for which WAKIX was originally approved in adult patients, it is estimated that 60% to 70% of those diagnosed with narcolepsy and treated also experience cataplexy, representing approximately 25,000 to 30,000 patients in the United States. On October 13, 2020, we received regulatory approval for WAKIX for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. We believe that the additional indication for cataplexy in adult patients strengthens the product profile of WAKIX and helps to facilitate access to WAKIX for adult patients suffering from both EDS and cataplexy associated with narcolepsy.
 We are actively working on our goal of label expansion for WAKIX in narcolepsy by pursuing an indication for pediatric patients suffering from narcolepsy. Approximately 3,600 of the diagnosed narcolepsy patients in the United States are 19 years of age or under. We believe that pediatric patients could benefit from new treatment options. Accordingly, we currently expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of 2021 for indications of both EDS and cataplexy in pediatric patients. Topline results from this clinical trial are expected in the first half of 2023. We also intend to submit a Pediatric Written Request to the FDA with the goal of obtaining pediatric exclusivity. 
 Additional Indications 
 We believe that pitolisant’s ability to regulate histamine gives it the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in other rare neurological disorders that are mediated through the H3 receptor and histamine signaling and offers a portfolio in a product opportunity with pitolisant. We plan to explore the potential benefit of pitolisant in additional rare neurological indications beyond narcolepsy, initially focusing on the treatment of EDS associated with PWS and DM. 
 PWS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a loss of function of specific genes on chromosome 15 resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction. The hypothalamus controls both sleep-wake states and hunger-satiety. Therefore, two of the main symptoms in patients with PWS are EDS and insatiable hunger, or hyperphagia. Other consequences of PWS include low muscle tone, short stature, behavioral problems and cognitive impairment. It is estimated that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 people in the United States suffer from PWS, and over half of those suffering from PWS also have reported or experienced EDS, for which there are no FDA-approved treatments. We completed a Phase 1 PK clinical trial in the United States in pediatric patients with PWS in the fourth quarter of 2019, and initiated a long-term, open-label safety study in these patients. In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with PWS and anticipate topline results from this clinical trial in the first half of 2022. 
 14


DM is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that affects the neuromuscular system as well as several other systems, for which there are no FDA-approved treatments. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and there are two main types: type 1 (“DM1”) and type 2 (“DM2”). The underlying cause of DM1 is a mutation in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (“DMPK”) gene on chromosome 19. DM1 is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy and affects as many as 140,000 patients in the United States. EDS and fatigue are hallmark clinical characteristics in the majority of patients with DM1 and are referred to as the most frequent non-muscular symptoms in patients with DM1. Cognitive impairment is also a prominent symptom in patients with DM1 and all of these symptoms are thought to be mediated through H3 receptors and histaminergic pathways located throughout the central nervous system (“CNS”). DM2 is not as common as DM1 with an estimated prevalence of between 3,000 and 29,000 patients in the United States. The underlying cause of DM2 is a mutation in the CCHC-Type Zinc Finger Nucleic Acid Binding Protein (“CBNP”) gene on chromosome 3. Patients with DM1 and DM2 share similar phenotypes but disease onset is later in patients with DM2 and symptoms tend to be milder. We submitted an IND for DM at the end of 2020 and the IND opened in January 2021, after which we received a “Study May Proceed” letter from the FDA in February 2021. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with DM1 during the first half of 2021 and anticipate topline results from this clinical trial in the second half of 2022. 
 
Development Pipeline Chart
 
Beyond the target indications listed above, we believe there are opportunities related to CNS disorders of hypersomnolence that we may pursue. We also intend to further explore pitolisant in other rare neurological disorders, potentially in those in which fatigue and cognitive impairment are prominent symptoms with significant impact on daily functioning. As we conduct our new clinical programs, we will generate new data and gain new insights that will help inform our development strategy in pursuit of additional indications in the future.

Our Commercialization Strategy 
 We launched WAKIX into the narcolepsy market in November 2019 and are engaging with HCPs, patients and payors through the focused commercialization strategy outlined below to optimize adoption of WAKIX in the marketplace: 

• | HCP Awareness and Adoption: To facilitate HCP awareness and adoption of WAKIX, we have deployed our dedicated, in-house, over 70-person sales team to educate a defined prescriber base of approximately 8,000 HCPs comprised of neurologists, pulmonologists, sleep specialists, psychiatrists and high-prescribing primary care physicians who specialize in or focus on sleep disorders. We believe these HCPs diagnose and treat approximately 90% of the narcolepsy patients in the United States. We began our commercial HCP outreach in August 2019 following FDA approval of WAKIX for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy and our efforts continue following the approval of the cataplexy indication in October 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patient Awareness: It is estimated that narcolepsy affects approximately 165,000 Americans with fewer than 50% diagnosed. Of those living with narcolepsy in the United States, it is estimated that fewer than 45,000 are on narcolepsy medications, which we believe indicates a significant unmet medical need. To drive patient awareness of WAKIX and its differentiated product profile, we have been communicating with the narcolepsy patient community and providing them with educational materials and information on WAKIX.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payor Coverage: Recognizing the importance of payor coverage, our field market access team has been engaging with national and regional payors over the past two plus years to educate them on the clinical data and value proposition of WAKIX. Through December 31, 2020, we have secured formulary access for approximately 80% of all insured lives (Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid) in the United States. Within these covered lives, we have observed favorable access to WAKIX subsequent to the expanded approval of WAKIX for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy in October 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the differentiating attributes of WAKIX that have facilitated and will continue to facilitate awareness, adoption, and coverage include: (i) it is a first-in-class molecule with a novel MOA, (ii) it is the first-and-only non-scheduled treatment approved for EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy, (iii) it is not a stimulant, (iv) it has broad clinical utility because it can be used as monotherapy or administered concomitantly with other narcolepsy treatments, and (v) it is a once-daily oral tablet administered in the morning upon wakening. 
 Clinical Development of WAKIX (pitolisant) 
 Overview 
 The strategy behind the clinical development of pitolisant is based on its MOA, which is thought to work by regulating histamine transmission. Pitolisant is a first-in-class molecule with a novel MOA, acting as a potent and highly selective antagonist/inverse agonist of the H3 receptor. It activates histaminergic neurons in the brain, a neuronal system involved in the maintenance of wakefulness, attention, vigilance and cognition. Pitolisant binds to H3 receptors on presynaptic neurons and blocks the normal negative feedback mechanism for histamine release, resulting in increased release of this wake-promoting neurotransmitter. It also functions as an inverse agonist, resulting in enhanced histamine synthesis and release from presynaptic neurons. Increased histamine available in the synapse binds to postsynaptic H1 receptors, activating postsynaptic neurons, which stimulate wake-promoting brain regions and inhibit sleep-promoting regions of the brain.

WAKIX® (pitolisant) Mechanism of Action 
 

Pitolisant also stimulates the release of other wake-promoting neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) via H3 heteroreceptors within those neuronal systems. Importantly, pitolisant does not increase dopamine levels in the striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, which is the brain’s reward center where an increase in dopamine levels is correlated with abuse potential. This feature of pitolisant’s MOA, along with primarily working through the histaminergic system, are two of the aspects that differentiate pitolisant from all other currently approved treatments for narcolepsy. 
 
The safety profile of pitolisant is based on pooled safety data from 22 Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials conducted by Bioprojet, eight of which were in patients with narcolepsy and 14 of which were in other indications. These trials included 1,513 unique patients, of whom 1,043 received pitolisant in double-blind placebo-controlled studies, and others received pitolisant in single-blind or open-label trials. Three successful pivotal trials in narcolepsy, HARMONY 1, HARMONY 1bis, and HARMONY CTP, were completed in Europe by Bioprojet and served as the foundation for the approval of pitolisant by the EMA in 2016 for the treatment of narcolepsy in adults with or without cataplexy. Pitolisant was evaluated in a long-term safety and tolerability trial, HARMONY 3, which further supported the results observed in HARMONY 1, HARMONY 1bis, and HARMONY CTP. The data from these trials were submitted, along with data from a human abuse potential (“HAP”) trial, to the FDA as part of the NDA for WAKIX (pitolisant), which the FDA approved on August 14, 2019 for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy and on October 13, 2020 for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. The table below provides an overview of the trial designs from these five clinical trials.

Name of Study Study Design | Number of Patients | Maximum Dose; % at that Dose | Primary Objective | Results 
HARMONY 1 Randomized, double-blind, placebo and active control; patients with narcolepsy ± cataplexy; 8 weeks of treatment | N = 95 | 35.6 mg; 61% | Assess change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (“ESS”) score from baseline to final visit | -6.0 for WAKIX compared to -2.9 for placebo (treatment effect -3.1; p=0.022) 
HARMONY 1bis Randomized, double-blind, placebo and active control; patients with narcolepsy ± cataplexy; 8 weeks of treatment | N = 166 | 17.8 mg 76% | Assess change in ESS score from baseline to final visit | -5.0 for WAKIX compared to -2.8 for placebo (treatment effect -2.2; p=0.030) 
HARMONY CTP Randomized, double-blind, placebo control; patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy; 7 weeks of treatment | N = 106 | 35.6 mg 65% | Assess change in Weekly Rate of Cataplexy (“WRC”) | WRC decreased 75% for WAKIX compared to 38% for placebo (rate ratio 0.51; p<0.0001) 
HARMONY 3 Long-term, open-label, real-world trial; ≥1 year | N = 104 | 35.6 mg 88% | Long-term safety | Safety/tolerability profile consistent with that seen in the RCTs 
Human Abuse Potential Study Randomized, double-blind, active & placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study | N = 43 | 35.6 mg & 213.6 mg; Phentermine 60 mg (active control) | Assess drug liking | WAKIX demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in drug liking (p<0.0001)

Clinical Trial Highlights 
 The key findings from these clinical trials are as follows: 
 
 
• | Pitolisant showed a statistically significant improvement in EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy. In HARMONY 1, the ESS score change from baseline to final visit was -6.0 for pitolisant compared to -2.9 for placebo (treatment effect -3.1; p=0.022). In HARMONY 1bis, the ESS score change from baseline to final visit was -5.0 for pitolisant compared to -2.8 for placebo (treatment effect -2.2; p=0.030). These findings were supported by statistically significant improvement on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (“MWT”). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pitolisant demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in measures of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. In HARMONY CTP, the reduction in the weekly rate of cataplexy in patients on pitolisant was

 18


 
75% compared to 38% in patients on placebo (rate ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.44 – 0.60; p<0.0001). This finding was supported by a significant reduction in cataplexy (a secondary endpoint) in the HARMONY 1 trial. However, the FDA initially stated that the cataplexy data from the HARMONY 1 trial in the NDA did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness with respect to cataplexy because the statistical analysis plan did not prospectively control for Type 1 error of the secondary endpoints, and the subgroup of patients with cataplexy was not identified prospectively. As a result, the FDA issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) with respect to the cataplexy indication, and therefore did not originally approve WAKIX for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. Subsequently, in June 2020, in response to our request for FDA to reconsider the cataplexy data from the HARMONY 1 trial, we received a general advice letter confirming that the cataplexy data from the HARMONY 1 clinical trial supported a statistically significant reduction in daily rate of cataplexy in the pitolisant group when compared with the placebo group. As a result, the FDA recommended we submit a complete response resubmission in pursuit of the adult cataplexy indication for WAKIX. On October 13, 2020, we received regulatory approval for WAKIX for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy.

• | Pitolisant was generally well-tolerated in clinical trials. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted in patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, the most common adverse reactions (occurring in >5% of patients and at twice the rate of placebo) with the use of pitolisant were insomnia (6%), nausea (6%), and anxiety (5%). In these trials, 6 of the 152 patients (3.9%) who received pitolisant and 4 of the 114 patients (3.5%) who received placebo discontinued because of an adverse event.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the HARMONY 3 trial, a favorable long-term safety/tolerability profile for pitolisant out to one year was demonstrated; safety findings were similar to those reported in the randomized controlled trials, with no new safety signals identified.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In this open-label, long-term real-world trial, improvement in EDS (as measured by a reduction in ESS scores) and reduction in cataplexy (as measured by reduction in mean daily cataplexy episodes) was maintained out to twelve months.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a clinical HAP trial, pitolisant demonstrated statistically significant lower maximum drug liking (primary endpoint), overall drug liking, and willingness to take drug again compared to phentermine (C-IV), with responses similar to placebo. No evidence of abuse potential was demonstrated based on clinical and preclinical data, and WAKIX was therefore approved without being scheduled as a controlled substance by the DEA.

HARMONY 1 
 Design 
 HARMONY 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pitolisant in adult patients with narcolepsy on improvement in EDS over an eight-week period. The trial was conducted in the EU, and consequently was designed to include both a placebo arm and an active comparator, modafinil, which was used in doses up to 400 mg/day. HARMONY 1 consisted of 95 patients and had flexible dosing during the first three weeks of the trial, followed by five weeks of stable dosing. The maximum dose of pitolisant in this dose-to-effect trial was 35.6 mg and only 61% of the patients were titrated to this dose for the stable dosing period. Approximately 80% of the patients had a history of cataplexy. 
 The primary endpoint in the trial was the ESS score at final visit, adjusted for baseline, for pitolisant compared to placebo. ESS is a self-administered eight-item questionnaire scored 0 to 24 with lower scores corresponding to lower EDS. Secondary endpoints in HARMONY 1 included ESS responder rates, MWT (an objective measure of the ability to stay awake), the Sustained Attention to Response Task (“SART”) reduction in cataplexy, Clinical Global Impression of Change (“CGI-C”) for both EDS and cataplexy, the European Quality of Life Questionnaire (the “EQ-5D”), and the Patient’s Global Opinion on the Effect of Treatment Questionnaire. The main efficacy objective of the trial was to demonstrate superiority of pitolisant compared to placebo on the primary 
 19


endpoint, while one of the secondary objectives was to explore the non-inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil on ESS score. It should be noted that there was no prospective plan to control for Type 1 error in this trial.
 Efficacy Results 
 Pitolisant showed a significant reduction in the mean ESS score change from baseline to final visit at end of trial as compared to placebo (-6.0 versus -2.9, respectively) and between-group differences in ESS score were evident within the first two weeks of treatment. This resulted in a treatment effect (ESS score at final visit, adjusted for baseline, for pitolisant compared to placebo) of -3.1, which was statistically significant for pitolisant versus placebo (p=0.022). The change from baseline in ESS score for modafinil was -6.9 and, based on this score, pitolisant was not found to be non-inferior to modafinil (mean difference of 0.09, p=0.932) and the trial therefore did not meet this secondary efficacy objective. We believe there are several factors that contributed to this finding. First, 73% of the patients on modafinil in this trial were titrated up to a dose of 400 mg/day (the recommended dose of modafinil in the FDA-approved U.S. Prescribing Information (“USPI”) is 200 mg/day) while only 61% of the patients on pitolisant were titrated to the maximum pitolisant dose of 35.6 mg/day (which is the maximum approved dose in the USPI), such that a greater number of patients in the modafinil arm received the maximum effective dose than those in the pitolisant arm, raising the possibility that those subjects in the pitolisant arm could have seen greater treatment effect had they been dosed at the maximum dose available. Second, the margin of non-inferiority for the difference in the ESS scores pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan was narrow (2 points), meaning that the change in ESS score adjusted for baseline compared between pitolisant and modafinil had to have a lower 95% CI of no less than -2 points to declare pitolisant non-inferior to modafinil. The lower bound of the 95% CI of the analysis fell just outside this margin (-2.11). According to literature, however, a clinically relevant difference on the ESS ranges from 2–3 points, such that the non-inferiority margins pre-specified under the statistical analysis plan may have been too narrow. Ultimately, however, the trial results comparing pitolisant and modafinil did not impact the FDA’s findings that pitolisant was effective for improvement in EDS, and the FDA-approved label for WAKIX does not contain any data on modafinil. 
Change in ESS Score Over Time 
 

Regarding the secondary endpoints, ESS responder rates (a responder was defined as having a final ESS score < 10) were significantly greater for those patients treated with pitolisant compared to those on placebo (45.2% vs. 13.3%, respectively; p=0.013). The responder rate for patients treated with modafinil was 45.5% and the difference compared to pitolisant was not statistically significant (p=0.892). On the MWT, pitolisant treatment improved performance when compared to placebo in a statistically significant manner (p=0.044), while improvement was not significantly different compared to modafinil (p=0.173).

Responders (Final ESS < 10) | Change in MWT

 With regard to other secondary endpoints, the overall pattern of response was that the findings for patients on both pitolisant and modafinil were superior to those on placebo while the responses were not significantly different for pitolisant compared to modafinil. The SART Total Score (a measure of attention) was significantly higher in the pitolisant group as compared to placebo (p=0.041), and while not significantly different from the modafinil group (p=0.363), the scores were similar (9.1 and 8.9 for pitolisant and modafinil, respectively). The CGI-C for EDS showed improvement in 56% of patients on placebo, 73% of patients on pitolisant, and 86% of patients on modafinil. Regarding the daily cataplexy rates endpoint, patients treated with pitolisant experienced a 62% reduction in the daily rate of cataplexy compared to a reduction of 8% in those on placebo and 25% in those on modafinil. Responses on the CGI-C for cataplexy were consistent with this outcome, with 29%, 45%, and 35% of patients who experienced cataplexy during the trial reporting an improvement in their cataplexy symptoms in the placebo, pitolisant, and modafinil groups, respectively. Lastly, the Patient’s Global Opinion on the Effect of Treatment Questionnaire recorded positive responses in 56% of patients in the placebo group, 81% of patients in the pitolisant group, and 86% of patients in the modafinil group. 
 Safety Results 
 Pitolisant was generally well tolerated in HARMONY 1. Sixty patients experienced a treatment emergent adverse event (“TEAE”) during the trial: 61% in the pitolisant group, 60% in the placebo group, and 70% in the modafinil group. The most commonly reported TEAE in the pitolisant treatment group was headache, reported by 35% of the patients, compared to 20% in the placebo group. Other frequently reported TEAEs in the pitolisant treatment group were insomnia, nausea and weight increase (each reported by two patients, or 6%). There were five serious adverse events during HARMONY 1 and none were considered treatment-related (two in the pitolisant group, two in the modafinil group, and one in the placebo group). There were no deaths during the trial and no significant changes in laboratory values or hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) from baseline to final visit in any group. 
HARMONY 1bis 
 HARMONY 1bis was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pitolisant in adult patients with narcolepsy on improvement in EDS over an eight-week period. This trial 
 21


was designed in accordance with recommendations from European regulators, and as such, contained both a placebo and active comparator arm. The active comparator was modafinil used in doses up to 400 mg/day. HARMONY 1bis enrolled 165 patients and had flexible dosing during the first three weeks of the trial, followed by five weeks of stable dosing. The maximum dose of pitolisant in this dose-to-effect trial was 17.8 mg and only 76% of the patients were titrated to this dose for the stable dosing period. 75% of the patients had a history of cataplexy. 
 The primary endpoint in the trial was the ESS score at final visit, adjusted for baseline, for pitolisant compared to placebo. Secondary endpoints included ESS responder rates, MWT, SART, reduction in cataplexy, CGI-C for both EDS and cataplexy, the EQ-5D, and the Patient’s Global Opinion on the Effect of Treatment Questionnaire. The main efficacy objective of the trial was to demonstrate superiority of pitolisant compared to placebo on the primary endpoint, while one of the secondary objectives was to explore the non-inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil on ESS score. It should be noted that there was no prospective plan to control for Type 1 error in this trial.
 Efficacy Results 
 Pitolisant showed a significant reduction in the mean ESS score change from baseline to final visit as compared to placebo (-5.0 versus -2.8, respectively). This resulted in a treatment effect (ESS score at final visit, adjusted for baseline, for pitolisant compared to placebo) of -2.2 (p=0.030). The treatment effect between modafinil and pitolisant was -2.75 and, based on this score and the pre-specified statistical analysis plan, resulted in pitolisant not being non-inferior to modafinil. We believe the same factors that contributed to this result in HARMONY 1 also apply to HARMONY 1bis. In addition, in this trial, the maximum dose of pitolisant to which patients could be titrated (17.8 mg) was not the maximum labeled dose for pitolisant (which is 35.6 mg), and 24% of patients in this trial were on doses lower than 17.8 mg, which means that a substantial percentage of patients were on study drug at an amount less than the maximum approved dose in the USPI for pitolisant. In addition, modafinil was dosed up to 400 mg/day, while the recommended dose of modafinil in its USPI is 200 mg/day, which means that the respective doses of pitolisant and modafinil were not comparable. 
 
Change in Mean ESS Score 
 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, ESS responder rates (a responder was defined as having a final ESS score < 10 or change in ESS score ≥ 3) were significantly greater for those patients treated with pitolisant compared to those on placebo (65% vs. 34%, respectively; p=0.001). The responder rate for patients treated with modafinil 
 22


was 77% and the difference compared to pitolisant was not statistically significant (p=0.086). On the MWT, pitolisant treatment significantly improved performance when compared to placebo (p=0.022), while improvement was not significantly different compared to modafinil (p=0.294). 
 

 
Responders (Final ESS ≤ 10 or Change in ESS ≥ 3) | Change in MWT
-------------------------------------------------+--------------


With regard to other secondary endpoints, the overall pattern of response was that the findings for patients on both pitolisant and modafinil were superior to those on placebo while the responses were not significantly different for pitolisant and modafinil. The pitolisant group’s SART Total Score was significantly improved compared to placebo (p=0.043), while not significantly different compared to modafinil (p=0.407). The CGI-C for EDS showed improvement in 37% of patients on placebo, 72% of patients on pitolisant, and 78% of patients on modafinil. Responses on the CGI-C for cataplexy showed improvement for 60% of patients treated with pitolisant compared to 54% of patients on modafinil and 36% of patients on placebo. However, the difference in the reduction in the daily rate of cataplexy between pitolisant (0.32) and placebo (0.31) was not statistically significant (p=0.873). Lastly, the findings on both the EQ-5D and the Patient’s Global Opinion on the Effect of Treatment Questionnaire did not show any meaningful differences between the pitolisant and placebo treatment groups in the HARMONY 1bis trial. 
 Safety Results 
 Pitolisant was generally well tolerated in HARMONY 1bis. Seventy-seven patients experienced a TEAE during the trial: 49% in the pitolisant group, 36% in the placebo group, and 49% in the modafinil group. The most commonly reported TEAEs in the pitolisant treatment group were headache (13%), dizziness (6%), vomiting (4.5%), insomnia (4.5%), and decreased appetite (4.5%). There were no serious adverse events in the pitolisant group and there was one serious adverse event during HARMONY 1bis in the modafinil treatment group, which was not treatment-related. There were no deaths during the trial and no significant changes in laboratory values or hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) from baseline to final visit. 
HARMONY CTP 
 Design 
 HARMONY CTP was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pitolisant on the reduction in cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy with frequent attacks of cataplexy over a seven-week period. HARMONY CTP consisted of 106 patients. The maximum dose of pitolisant in this dose-to-effect trial was 35.6 mg and only 65% of patients reached this dose during the stable dosing period. Both stimulants and wake-promoting agents were prohibited during the trial; only 11% of subjects were on stable doses of anti-cataplectic medications (7% in the pitolisant treatment group and 16% in patients on placebo). 
 The primary endpoint in HARMONY CTP was the change in the weekly rate of cataplexy (“WRC”) from baseline to the stable dosing period (Weeks 4–7) expressed as the rate ratio (change in the pitolisant group/change in the placebo group). Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients with high cataplexy rate (WRC >15), CGI-
 23


C for cataplexy and EDS, mean change in ESS score and percentage of ESS responders, MWT, the EQ-5D, number of days with hallucinations (as recorded in the patient diaries), and Patient’s Global Opinion on the Effect of Treatment Questionnaire. It should be noted that there was no prospective plan to control for Type 1 error in this trial.
 Efficacy Results 
 In HARMONY CTP, pitolisant resulted in a significantly greater reduction than placebo in the WRC from baseline to the stable dosing period (Weeks 4–7), with a 75% reduction in the pitolisant group compared to a 38% reduction in the placebo group (rate ratio 0.51; 95% CI (0.44, 0.60; p<0.0001). Further, significantly fewer patients had WRC >15 at endpoint with pitolisant (6%) versus placebo (24%) (p=0.005). The clinical relevance of these findings was captured by the CGI-C related to cataplexy. Mean CGI-C score was 3.5±1.1 with placebo versus 2.6±1.1 with pitolisant. The mean reduction of the CGI-C score for pitolisant compared with placebo was -0.95 (95% CI (-1.36, -0.54); p<0.0001). Overall positive response rates on the CGI-C related to cataplexy were 67% on pitolisant and 33% on placebo. 

Percent Reduction in WRC | Reduction in WRC Over Time
-------------------------+---------------------------

 With regard to other secondary endpoints, pitolisant demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mean ESS score from baseline to final visit at week seven as compared to placebo (-5.4 vs. -1.9; p=0.0001) and significantly higher ESS responder rates compared to placebo (p=0.035 for Type 1 ESS responders rate and p=0.002 for Type 2 ESS responders rate; see graph below). On the CGI-C related to EDS, the mean score was 3.7 with placebo versus 2.6 with pitolisant, with a mean reduction of -0.99 (p<0.0001). Overall positive response rates on the CGI-C related to EDS were 69% on pitolisant and 24% on placebo.

Change in ESS Score Over Time | ESS Responder Rate
------------------------------+-------------------

 On the remainder of the secondary endpoints, pitolisant showed a statistically significant improvement on the MWT from baseline to end of trial compared to placebo. Baseline geometric means on the MWT were 4.3 minutes and 3.7 minutes for placebo and pitolisant, respectively, with final MWT values of 4.6 minutes and 7.1 minutes for placebo and pitolisant, respectively; the improvement in MWT was 78% higher with pitolisant compared to placebo (p=0.003). On the Patient’s Global Opinion on the Effect of Treatment Questionnaire, overall improvement was reported in 54% of patients on pitolisant and 26% of patients on placebo (p=0.001). 
 Safety Results 
 Pitolisant was generally well tolerated in HARMONY CTP. Thirty-five patients experienced a TEAE during the trial: 35% in the pitolisant group and 31% in the placebo group. The most commonly reported AE in the pitolisant group in HARMONY CTP was headache, which 9% of the group reported, compared to 10% in the placebo group. Other frequently reported AEs in the pitolisant group were irritability, anxiety and nausea (each reported by 3 patients, or 6%). There were no deaths or serious adverse events during HARMONY CTP and no significant changes in laboratory values or hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) from baseline to final trial visit in either group. 
HARMONY 3 
 Design 
 HARMONY 3 was an open-label, real-world trial to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of pitolisant in the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy, over a one-year period (with a 5-year extension at the trial sites in France). HARMONY 3 enrolled 104 patients, 102 of whom were treated with pitolisant, and 68 completed out to one year. In HARMONY 3, 75% of patients had a history of cataplexy and 76% of patients who completed out to one year were on the maximum dose of pitolisant of 35.6 mg. For the 5-year extension phase at the trial sites in France, 50 patients were eligible to continue, of which 48 patients elected to do so and 32 of them were maintained on pitolisant out to 5 years or until the study ended. 
 
25


Efficacy Results 
 In the 68 patients with data at baseline and at 12 months in HARMONY 3, pitolisant reduced the mean ESS score by -4.63 over this period. The magnitude of the decrease in ESS score was larger in the subgroup of patients (n=86) who were not on pitolisant at trial entry (-5.25) as compared to the subgroup of patients (n=16) who came into the trial on pitolisant from the French Compassionate Use Program (-2.63).

In HARMONY 3, pitolisant also demonstrated a reduction in cataplexy and other symptoms of REM intrusion into wakefulness from baseline to month 12, showing a reduction of 65% to 76% in partial or total cataplexy attacks, respectively, out to one year. Reductions of more than 50% were also seen for other symptoms of REM dysfunction, such as hallucinations and sleep paralysis.

Safety Results 
 Pitolisant was generally well tolerated in HARMONY 3. AEs observed with long-term pitolisant treatment were consistent with those observed in short-term randomized, controlled trials such as HARMONY 1, HARMONY 1bis, and HARMONY CTP. Fifty-eight of the 102 treated patients (57%) reported an aggregate of 168 TEAEs in HARMONY 3, the most common of which are shown in the table below. During the one-year trial, there were no deaths and seven patients reported 10 serious adverse events, nine of which were deemed by the investigator to be unrelated to pitolisant, and one miscarriage which was considered possibly related. No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs or electrocardiogram parameters were recorded over the course of the one year trial.

Clinical HAP Trial 
 Design 
 A clinical HAP trial was conducted to evaluate the human abuse potential of pitolisant. In this trial, nondependent, recreational stimulant users able to distinguish phentermine hydrochloride (HCl; 60 mg), a CIV stimulant, from placebo in a drug discrimination test were randomized in a 4-period, double-blind, crossover design to receive single doses of pitolisant 35.6 mg (therapeutic dose), pitolisant 213.6 mg (supra-therapeutic dose), phentermine HCl 60 mg, and placebo. The primary endpoint was maximum effect (Emax) on the 100-point Drug Liking (at the moment) visual analog scale. 
Results 
 A total of 43 subjects were enrolled and 38 completed the trial. Mean Drug Liking Emax was significantly greater for phentermine (78.7) versus pitolisant 35.6 mg (57.3; p<0.0001) and pitolisant 213.6 mg (59.0; p<0.0001). Drug Liking Emax was similar for pitolisant (both doses) and placebo (56.1) (p<0.001 for 35.6 mg versus placebo, and p=0.003 for 213.6 mg versus placebo). 

Maximum Drug Liking

 Similarly, for key secondary measures of Overall Drug Liking and willingness to Take Drug Again, mean Emax scores were significantly greater for phentermine (77.4 for Overall Drug Liking and 78.7 for Take Drug Again) versus pitolisant 213.6 mg (49.3 and 44.5) and 35.6 mg (52.7 and 49.4) ( p < 0.0001 for each comparison for both doses of pitolisant compared to phentermine).

Take Drug Again 
 
In summary, in the clinical HAP trial, pitolisant demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in drug liking compared to phentermine as well as an overall response profile similar to placebo. Based on these clinical data, along with data from preclinical abuse liability studies, the evidence pointed to a low risk of abuse for pitolisant, which supported the approval of WAKIX without being scheduled as a controlled substance by the DEA.

Post-Hoc Analyses for Pitolisant 
 We conducted three post-hoc analyses from the database of the narcolepsy clinical trials for pitolisant, which focused on clinically relevant aspects of the product profile. The first analysis examined the time-to-onset of clinical response for pitolisant for improvement in both EDS and reduction in cataplexy based on data from 61 patients in the HARMONY 1 (pitolisant, n=31; placebo, n=30) and 105 patients in the HARMONY CTP (pitolisant, n=54; placebo, n=51) randomized, controlled clinical trials. Study medication was individually titrated to a potential maximum dose of pitolisant 35.6 mg/d and then remained stable; 61% of patients in HARMONY 1 and 65% in HARMONY CTP were titrated to the 35.6 mg dose.  Efficacy assessments included the ESS and WRC or daily rate of cataplexy. Onset of clinical response was defined as the first timepoint at which there was a statistically significant difference between pitolisant and placebo. For time-to-response for EDS using the ESS, least-squares (“LS”) mean change from baseline was significantly greater for pitolisant compared with placebo beginning at Week 2 in HARMONY 1 and Week 3 in HARMONY CTP (when patients were first able to receive the 17.8 mg dose in each study) and continued through the end of treatment. More pitolisant-treated patients were classified as treatment responders (ESS reduction of ≥ 3 points) at each post-baseline assessment than were patients in the placebo group. Pitolisant treatment resulted in a significantly greater proportion of responders versus placebo beginning at Week 3 in both studies.  In HARMONY CTP, the frequency of cataplexy attacks was significantly reduced for pitolisant compared with placebo beginning at Week 2 and continued through the end of treatment. The percentage of cataplexy responders in HARMONY CTP was significantly greater with pitolisant versus placebo beginning at Week 1 for response defined as ≥ 25% reduction in WRC and at Week 2 for response defined as ≥ 50% reduction in WRC. There was no evidence of rebound cataplexy after a one-week placebo washout phase. In summary, the onset of clinical response was observed beginning at Week 2 (HARMONY 1) or Week 3 (HARMONY CTP) for mean change in ESS score and at Week 2 (HARMONY CTP) for mean change in WRC, with further improvements observed in pitolisant-treated patients through the end of treatment. The percentage of treatment responders was significantly greater with pitolisant versus placebo beginning at Week 3 for EDS (defined as ESS score reduction ≥ 3) and at Week 2 for cataplexy (defined as ≥ 50% reduction in WRC).

A second post-hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of pitolisant in patients with narcolepsy who had a high symptom burden (both EDS and cataplexy) at baseline; this analysis was based on pooled data from both the HARMONY 1 and HARMONY CTP clinical trials, in which patients could be titrated up to a maximum dose of 35.6 mg/day. The analyses included three independent patient subgroups: baseline score of ≥16 on the ESS, sleep latency of <8 minutes on MWT, and ≥15 cataplexy attacks per week. The analysis populations included 118 patients for the ESS (pitolisant, n=60; placebo, n=58), 105 for the MWT (pitolisant, n=59; placebo, n=46), and 31 for cataplexy (pitolisant, n=20; placebo, n=11). LS mean change in ESS from baseline was significantly greater for pitolisant (-6.1) compared with placebo (-2.3; p<0.001). A significantly greater percentage of pitolisant-treated patients were classified as treatment responders: for ESS score reduction >3, 69.0% in the pitolisant group versus 35.1% in the placebo group (p=0.001); for final ESS score <10, 36.2% versus 10.5%, respectively (p=0.005). Mean increase in sleep latency on the MWT was significantly greater for pitolisant (6.9 minutes) compared with placebo (3.4 minutes; p=0.017).  In patients with a high burden of cataplexy, LS mean change in the WRC was significantly greater for pitolisant (–14.5) compared with placebo (–0.1; P = 0.004). On average, the frequency of cataplexy attacks was reduced by 60.6% in the pitolisant group and <1% in the placebo group. Adverse events in the analysis populations were consistent with the known safety profile of pitolisant; headache was the most common adverse event in pitolisant-treated patients (10.0%–20.0%). These analyses demonstrated pitolisant resulted in significant improvement in patients who experience a high burden of the two most common symptoms in narcolepsy, EDS and cataplexy.

In the third post-hoc analysis, we evaluated the cardiac safety events associated with pitolisant because cardiovascular diseases are comorbid conditions in patients with narcolepsy. Cardiovascular adverse effects are of concern with narcolepsy medications because of this comorbidity and most patients require lifelong pharmacotherapy for both narcolepsy and cardiovascular disorders. Data were obtained from a pooled analysis of the HARMONY 1 (8-week) and HARMONY CTP (7-week) clinical trials and from the 12-month, open-label 
 33


HARMONY 3 trial. The pooled analysis included 166 patients (pitolisant, n=85; placebo, n=81). Mean change in heart rate from baseline to end-of-treatment was -0.5 beats/min with pitolisant and -0.2 beats/min with placebo (LS mean difference, -0.4; p=0.744). Mean change was also similar for pitolisant versus placebo in systolic (LS mean difference, 0.0; p=0.983) and diastolic (LS mean difference, -0.6; p=0.552) blood pressure, as was mean change in QTc interval (LS mean difference, 0.4; p=0.911). Cardiac adverse events with pitolisant included heart rate increase (n=4), right bundle branch block (n=1), sinus tachycardia (n=1), and palpitations (n=1), and with placebo included blood pressure increase (n=1). In the long-term study, mean change from baseline in QTc interval was 3.1 msec at Month 6 (n=70) and 6.1 msec at Month 12 (n=67); three patients had a post-baseline increase >60 msec but none had QTc >500 msec. Based on this analysis, no cardiac safety signals were observed during treatment with pitolisant administered up to the maximum dose of 35.6 mg and for up to one year. 
 Potential New Indications for Pitolisant 
 We are actively working on label expansion for WAKIX in narcolepsy, including indications for both EDS and cataplexy in pediatric patients. We also intend to work with the FDA toward gaining pediatric exclusivity for WAKIX. We believe that pitolisant’s ability to regulate histamine and histaminergic signaling gives it the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in other disorders that are mediated through the H3 receptor and histamine signaling and offers a portfolio in a product opportunity with pitolisant. Histamine plays an important role in normal physiologic functioning beyond wakefulness in the areas of attention, vigilance, behavior and cognition. The presence of H3 receptors in the hypothalamus, brainstem and cerebral cortex account for different functions, which could provide an opportunity for pitolisant to treat symptoms other than EDS in different disorders. In addition, H3 receptors are located mainly in the CNS as opposed to other parts of the body outside the CNS. This fact, along with pitolisant being highly selective for the H3 receptor (as opposed to H1 receptors, H2 receptors and H4 receptors), is the reason we believe in pitolisant’s unique MOA and its potential to improve symptoms in patients living with rare neurological disorders, in which impaired histamine signaling is part of the underlying pathophysiology. 

• Role of histamine in normal physiologic functioning beyond wake promotion (e.g. attention, vigilance, behavior, cognition) • Location of H3 receptors in hypothalamus, brainstem, and cerebral cortex account for different functions (and potential symptoms in different disorders) • Limited H3 receptor populations outside the CNS 

 
Our initial plan is to seek new indications in patient populations that have symptom overlap with narcolepsy, such as EDS, while potentially pursuing opportunities in other CNS disorders of hypersomnolence. The initial clinical targets will focus on rare neurological disorders consistent with our overall strategy. We submitted an IND for PWS in October 2019 and received acknowledgement from the FDA that the proposed clinical investigation may proceed. We subsequently completed a Phase 1 PK clinical trial in pediatric patients with PWS in the fourth quarter of 2019, and initiated a long-term, open-label safety trial in these patients. In December 2020, we initiated a 
 34


Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS and other key symptoms in patients with PWS and anticipate topline results from this trial in the first half of 2022. We submitted an IND for DM at the end of 2020 and the IND opened in January 2021, after which we received a “Study May Proceed” letter from the FDA in February 2021. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with DM1 during the first half of 2021, and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2022. While conducting clinical programs to evaluate these indications, other clinical endpoints beyond EDS will be evaluated as secondary or exploratory endpoints, such as behavioral symptoms, vigilance, fatigue and cognition, to broaden the investigation of pitolisant with the hope of generating pilot data to help inform the next phase of our clinical development strategy. 
 Label Expansion in Narcolepsy 
 Cataplexy Indication 
 The NDA submission for WAKIX initially sought approval for the treatment of both EDS and cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy. Our application requesting approval for a cataplexy indication was based on the cataplexy results from HARMONY CTP and HARMONY 1. The FDA approved WAKIX for the treatment of EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy but issued a CRL for the cataplexy indication, . The FDA determined that, although we had submitted one positive clinical trial for cataplexy (HARMONY CTP), the NDA submission did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness regarding cataplexy. The FDA therefore recommended that we conduct a second trial substantiating the results of HARMONY CTP in order to obtain approval for the cataplexy indication. 
 We attended a Type A post-CRL meeting with the FDA on December 12, 2019 to discuss the cataplexy indication, during which we pointed the FDA to additional analyses that were conducted in support of the HARMONY 1 cataplexy data and which were included in the NDA submission. Following additional interactions with the FDA, we received a general advice letter in June 2020 stating that the FDA had re-analyzed data from the HARMONY 1 clinical trial and confirmed that the cataplexy data from the HARMONY 1 clinical trial supported a statistically significant reduction in the daily rate of cataplexy in the pitolisant group when compared with the placebo group. As a result, the FDA recommended we submit a complete response resubmission in pursuit of the adult cataplexy indication for WAKIX, which we sent to the FDA in August 2020. On October 13, 2020 we received regulatory approval for WAKIX for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy.
 Pediatric Narcolepsy 
 Approximately 5% of diagnosed narcolepsy patients (approximately 3,600 patients) are 19 years of age or under. Symptoms often have a more profound effect in children, resulting in reduced function and greater psychological impact. Until the fourth quarter of 2018, no treatments were approved for pediatric patients with narcolepsy, at which time Xyrem received an expanded indication for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients seven years of age or older with narcolepsy. Xywav (low sodium formulation of Xyrem) received the same indication in July 2020. We intend to engage with the FDA in pursuit of pediatric exclusivity and commence a Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients in the second half of 2021 in pursuit of pediatric indications for both EDS and cataplexy. Our current plan is to evaluate approximately 90 to 100 pediatric patients, ages six to up to 18, to assess the safety and efficacy of pitolisant in pediatric narcolepsy patients on improvement in both EDS and reduction in cataplexy. 
Develop Pitolisant in New Patient Populations in Pursuit of Additional Indications 
 Prader-Willi Syndrome 
 PWS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a loss of function of specific genes on chromosome 15 resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction and decreased levels of hypocretin in some patients with PWS. The hypothalamus controls both sleep-wake states and hunger-satiety; therefore, two of the main symptoms in patients with PWS are EDS and hyperphagia. Other features include low muscle tone, short stature, behavioral problems and cognitive impairment. It is estimated that approximately one in 15,000 to 20,000 people in the United States suffer from PWS, and over half of those suffering from PWS also have reported or experienced EDS. We submitted an IND for PWS in October 2019 and received acknowledgement from the FDA that the proposed clinical investigation may proceed. We subsequently completed a Phase 1 PK clinical trial in pediatric patients with PWS in the fourth quarter of 2019, and initiated a long-term, open-label safety trial in these patients. In December 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate pitolisant for the treatment of EDS and other key symptoms in patients with PWS and anticipate topline results from this trial in the first half of 2022. 
 35


PWS poses a heavy burden for both patients and caregivers and there are few therapeutic options available and no FDA-approved treatments for EDS in patients with PWS. Clinical development programs in PWS have focused on hyperphagia, with no other programs focusing on EDS or cognitive function. EDS is thought to have a negative effect on behavior and cognitive function and could exacerbate these symptoms in patients with PWS.  In addition, impaired histamine signaling in the brain can contribute to behavioral symptoms and impaired cognition. We believe there is a compelling opportunity for the mechanism of action of pitolisant to impact the EDS component of this disorder as well as other symptoms, such as behavioral issues and cognitive impairment. 
 We have collaborated with the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research (the “FPWR”) to advance our clinical program and underscore our commitment to this patient population. We are members of the FPWR Clinical Trials Consortium and are working with members of its Scientific Advisory Board to gain their insights for our development program. Progress to date includes (i) opening an IND for PWS in October 2019, (ii) the completion of a Phase 1 PK trial in patients with PWS in the fourth quarter of 2019, with patients actively rolling over into an open-label, long-term safety trial, (iii) the submission of a Phase 2 clinical protocol to the FDA for review and comment, and (iv) initiation of a Phase 2 trial in December 2020.
 The Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of pitolisant in patients with PWS ages 6 to 65. An estimated 60 to 70 patients will be enrolled at approximately 10 sites across the United States. Patients will be randomized to low-dose pitolisant, high-dose pitolisant or placebo in a 1:1:1 treatment ratio and titrated over three weeks up to their randomized dose, followed by eight weeks of stable dosing. The primary trial objective is to assess for improvement in EDS as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Secondary endpoints include several behavioral symptom scales as well as specific measures of cognitive function using validated computer-based assessments. Clinician global impression of disease severity, caregiver global impression of EDS severity, and overall caregiver burden will be measured. Exploratory endpoints include the effect of pitolisant on hyperphagia and measurements of ghrelin levels. Patients who complete the trial will be eligible to participate in an open-label extension phase to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of pitolisant in patients with PWS, which will run throughout the duration of the PWS development program. 
 Myotonic Dystrophy
 DM is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that affects the neuromuscular system as well as several other systems. The primary symptom in patients with DM is myotonia, which is an impairment in the ability of muscles to relax; progressive muscle weakness is another prominent symptom of the disorder. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and there are two main types: DM1 and DM2. The underlying cause of DM1 is a mutation in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19. DM1 is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy and affects as many as 140,000 patients in the United States. EDS and fatigue are hallmark clinical characteristics in the majority of patients with DM1 and are referred to as the most frequent non-muscular symptoms in patients with DM1. EDS and fatigue occur in approximately 80% to 90% of patients with DM1. Cognitive impairment is also a prominent symptom in patients with DM1 and all of these symptoms are thought to be mediated through H3 receptors and histaminergic pathways located throughout the CNS. DM2 is not as common as DM1 with an estimated prevalence of between 3,000 and 29,000 patients in the United States. The underlying cause of DM2 is a mutation in the CBNP gene on chromosome 3. Patients with DM1 and DM2 share similar phenotypes but disease onset is later in patients with DM2 and symptoms tend to be milder. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for patients with DM, which represents a significant unmet medical need. 
 The therapeutic application of pitolisant may provide benefits across the key symptoms of EDS and fatigue which are often among the chief complaints of patients with DM. In a survey of 451 DM1 patients, daytime sleepiness and fatigue were second only to muscle weakness in symptom prevalence and impact. Our clinical program will be designed to demonstrate effect on measures of EDS and fatigue, as well as assess performance related to cognitive function, such as attention, vigilance and working memory. Progress to date includes working with key opinion leaders to develop the scientific rationale for the investigation of pitolisant in patients with DM, development of a Phase 2 clinical protocol, submission of an IND at the end of 2020, the opening of an IND in January 2021 and receipt of a “Study May Proceed” letter from the FDA in February 2021. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with DM1 in the first half of 2021.
 36


The proposed Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of pitolisant in adult patients with DM ages 18 to 65. An estimated 130 to 140 patients will be enrolled at approximately 14 to 16 sites across the United States. Patients will be randomized to low-dose pitolisant, high-dose pitolisant, or placebo in a 1:1:1 treatment ratio and titrated over three weeks up to their randomized dose, followed by eight weeks of stable dosing. The primary trial objective is to assess for improvement in EDS as measured by the MWT and the ESS. Secondary endpoints include assessments of fatigue as well as specific measures of cognitive function using validated computer-based assessments. Clinician and patient global impression of disease severity using the CGI-S and PGI-S, respectively, will be measured as well as disease-specific patient assessments of overall disease burden. Plasma samples will be collected to generate pharmacokinetic data and a PK/PD analysis will be performed. Patients who complete the trial will be eligible to participate in an open-label extension phase to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of pitolisant in patients with DM, which will run throughout the duration of the DM development program. 
 Other Potential Indications 
 The next phase of clinical development for pitolisant will be guided by the signals generated from the clinical trials described above and other potential trials in patients with PWS and DM. If we observe favorable results in these trials on the symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, we plan to investigate pitolisant in other rare neurological patient populations in which these symptoms are a prominent part of the disease process and result in significant impact on daily functioning. Furthermore, we believe opportunities exist in adjacent disorders to narcolepsy, including other CNS disorders of hypersomnolence, which could lead to additional potential new indications.
Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution
 We sell WAKIX to our customers, a limited number of specialty distributors, that, in turn, distribute WAKIX to patients.
 We have secured a commercial drug supply to support the launch of WAKIX in the United States. Although we do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing, we have contracted directly with third parties for each of these functions. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements that govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, and more. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and compliance is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 
 Our current supply chain for WAKIX involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, specifically, intermediate and starting material manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing, and drug product manufacturing, labeling and secondary packaging, and distribution services: 
  
• | Interor S.A. manufactures our BF4 and BF6 intermediate and starting material used in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”).

Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change as research provides a deeper understanding of rare neurological disorders, including narcolepsy, and as new therapies are developed. We face potential competition from multiple sources, including large pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of WAKIX, and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 
WAKIX competes with currently FDA-approved products for the treatment of EDS or cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy, all of which are controlled substances. Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Xyrem (sodium oxybate) is an FDA-approved product for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with  narcolepsy Xyrem is a Schedule III controlled substance available only through a restricted access REMS program. Xywav, a lower sodium formulation of Xyrem, was approved in July 2020, (became commercially available in November 2020), and is also a Schedule III controlled substance subject to the same restricted access REMS program as Xyrem. Provigil and Nuvigil, which are Schedule IV WPAs, and stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamine (both Schedule II controlled substances), are approved for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy. Anti-depressants and certain other agents are sometimes used off-label for the treatment of cataplexy in narcolepsy. Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Sunosi (solriamfetol) was approved by the FDA in March 2019 and launched in July 2019. Sunosi (solriamfetol) is a Schedule IV controlled substance and is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with EDS associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. It is not indicated for cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Additionally, Avadel Pharmaceuticals is working on a once nightly formulation version of sodium oxybate, with approval expected in 2021 or beyond, and Xyrem is expected to go generic in 2023. Beyond 2023, there are other potential future competitive products in development, including Axsome Therapeutics’s AXS-12 (reboxetine) product candidate and Takeda’s TAK-925/994 (orexin 2 receptor agonist) product candidates. 
 We believe WAKIX offers a differentiated product profile that is competitive with each of the products listed above, some of which are only approved for EDS while others (Xyrem and Xywav) are approved for the treatment of both EDS or cataplexy in  patients with narcolepsy. It should be noted that WAKIX has not been compared with these products in head-to-head clinical trials, but its non-scheduled status represents a distinct competitive advantage relative to those same products. Additionally, WAKIX is priced lower than Xyrem and Xywav, which we believe is a competitive advantage for WAKIX and may contribute to third-party payor preferences for WAKIX relative to Xyrem and Xywav. Conversely, WAKIX is priced higher than other competitors such as Provigil, Nuvigil, Sunosi and certain generic competitors, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, which may contribute to third-party payor preferences for those lower-priced treatment options relative to WAKIX. 
 Customers and Suppliers
 We depend on a few major customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, three customers accounted for 100% of gross product revenues; Caremark LLC accounted for 40% of gross product revenues; PANTHERx Specialty Pharmacy LLC accounted for 33% of gross product revenues; and Accredo Health Group, Inc. accounted for 27% of gross product revenues. We also depend on a single source supplier for our product, product candidates and active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Strategic Agreement 
 License and Commercialization Agreement with Bioprojet 
 On July 28, 2017, we and Bioprojet entered into the Bioprojet License Agreement. Bioprojet granted to us an exclusive, sublicensable license to commercialize, in the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and protectorates, including Puerto Rico, a product containing pitolisant currently known as WAKIX for narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnia, Parkinson’s disease, and any other indication agreed upon by the parties (which currently include PWS and DM), or the field, as well as rights to related patent rights, know-how, trademarks, trade dress, regulatory filings and approvals (the “Bioprojet Assets”). Bioprojet also granted us a co-
 38


exclusive (with Bioprojet), sublicensable license to Bioprojet Assets to clinically develop and register the pitolisant product in the field in the United States. Bioprojet retains the right to manufacture the product in the United States, and to develop outside the United States and commercialize other products that contain pitolisant as an active ingredient anywhere in the world.

Bioprojet shall keep us informed of the course of prosecution and other proceedings in the United States. We have the first right to enforce the licensed patent rights with respect to any infringing products in the United States. If we do not bring an action to enforce such patents against infringing activities that involve such infringing products, Bioprojet has the right to bring such action. 
 We paid Bioprojet an initial license fee of $150.0 million, a milestone payment of $50.0 million upon FDA acceptance of the NDA in February 2019, and a milestone payment of $75.0 million plus an addition $2.0 million fee for approval of the NDA in November 2019. Upon the Cataplexy Milestone Trigger Date, we became obligated to make the Cataplexy Milestone Payment to Bioprojet pursuant to the terms of the Bioprojet License Agreement. Subsequently, in October 2020, we made a payment to Bioprojet of $2.0 million to extend the Cataplexy Milestone Payment due date to within 90 days of the Cataplexy Milestone Trigger Date. On January 6, 2021, we made the $100.0 million Cataplexy Milestone Payment in full to Bioprojet. In addition, we are subject to a milestone payment of $40.0 million upon the attainment of aggregate net sales of WAKIX in the United States of $500.0 million subsequent to the date of NDA approval by the FDA pursuant to the Bioprojet License Agreement. We agreed to pay royalties on the product at tiered royalty rates of 13% to 24% based on annual total net sales during the period commencing on first commercial sale of the product and ending on the latest of 10 years from first commercial sale of the product, expiration of all regulatory exclusivity, or expiration of the last Bioprojet patent covering the product. Such royalty payments are subject to reductions based on royalties paid to any third party in order for us to commercialize the product. We also agreed to pay royalties in consideration for a trademark license at a rate of 3% of net sales for 20 years after first commercial sale of the product. We further agreed to pay minimum royalties during the third through tenth year of the Bioprojet License Agreement if the product is approved for narcolepsy to the extent such minimum royalties exceed the royalties payable as described above, which minimum amounts were calculated based on sales materially below our sales forecast. 
 The Bioprojet License Agreement will continue until the expiration of the obligation to pay royalties with respect to the product. We and Bioprojet may each terminate the Bioprojet License Agreement for a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days. Bioprojet may terminate the Bioprojet License Agreement in its entirety if we or our sublicensees challenge the licensed patents. In addition, we and Bioprojet have the right to terminate the Bioprojet License Agreement upon the other party’s insolvency. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, is important to our business. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary intellectual property protection for our WAKIX product and potential future pitolisant-based products, as well as for future 
 39


product candidates and novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among other methods, licensing or filing U.S. and foreign patents and applications relating to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. 
 
Our patent portfolio comprises three U.S. patents exclusively licensed to us from Bioprojet. One U.S. patent, No. 8,207,197, has claims directed to a polymorph, i.e. a specific crystalline form, of pitolisant and, methods for preparing that polymorph of pitolisant, which is expected to expire in February 2029 without taking into consideration any possible patent term extension. A second U.S. patent, No. 8,486,947, has claims directed to methods of treating excessive daytime sleepiness by administering pitolisant, which is expected to expire in September 2029 without taking into consideration any possible patent term extension. With all applicable patent term adjustments available and granted to us, the term of the last-to-expire pitolisant-related patent in our portfolio extends to September 2029. We may receive additional patent term based on the patent term extension described below. 
 The term of individual patents in our portfolio depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term adjustment, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for delays incurred at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) during the patent prosecution process. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent per approved drug may be extended under the Hatch-Waxman Act. We have applied for patent term extension on two patents covering pitolisant, only one of which will receive patent term extension, if at all. While we have received confirmation from the USPTO that the patents are eligible for patent term extension, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extension should be granted. We estimate the length of such extension to be 389 days; however, the USPTO, in conjunction with the FDA, will calculate the length of such extension and there is no guarantee that their calculation will align with our estimate. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, issued patents do not guarantee the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Issued patents only allow us to block potential competitors from practicing the claimed inventions of the issued patents. 
 Further, patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, 
 40


before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
 We and/or our licensor also rely on protections under trade secret laws, and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our trade secrets include, for example, certain program specific synthesis, formulations, patient selection strategies and certain aspects of our research. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us, and for employees and consultants to enter into invention assignment agreements with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Where applicable, the agreements provide that all inventions to which the individual contributed as an inventor shall be assigned to us, and as such, will become our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
 Further, we have in-licensed from Bioprojet the registered trademark product name “WAKIX” in the United States. We also have registered trademark protection in the United States for “KNOW NARCOLEPSY” as well as our brand and logo “HB,” “HB HARMONY BIOSCIENCES” and “HARMONY BIOSCIENCES.” We also have trademark applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for “REM AT THE WRONG TIME” and “NON-REM AT THE WRONG TIME.” 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 
 
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
41


 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS program or to conduct a post-approval study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 
 
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
42


 
• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. Specifically, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety and quality. 
 
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 43


After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 
FDA Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for 
 44


review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The designation includes all of the benefits of a fast track designation. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. 
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later 
 45


discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (“505(b)(2) NDA”) submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 46


Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that (i) affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or (ii) if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants an orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Among other benefits of an orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the user fee for the NDA. 
 Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 We received an orphan designation for pitolisant for the treatment of narcolepsy and, upon approval of WAKIX, we received orphan exclusivity until 2026. 
 DEA Regulation 
 The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”) establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. 
 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The FDA did not recommend that the DEA schedule WAKIX as a controlled substance, and WAKIX is therefore not scheduled as a controlled substance by the DEA. 
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.

The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. 
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also regulate controlled substances. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies are subject to federal healthcare laws and regulations as well as regulation by the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include U.S. federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, consumer protection and transparency laws as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S., including, without limitation, those laws described below. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. 
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Federal government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. 
 48


The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include payments and transfers of value made during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives.
 Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing information and marketing expenditures or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
 Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs, and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Data Privacy and Security Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the U.S., HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information (“PHI”), a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the HHS may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”). The FTC expects 
 49


a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
 In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA, many of which may differ from each other, thus, complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.
 In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), went into effect in May 2018 and imposes stringent data protection requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA as well as to those outside the EEA if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EEA member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”) which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and 
 50


managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. In the United States, no uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products among third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that a product will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell a product profitably. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts (increased to 70 percent pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA in its entirety, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal 
 51


year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. 
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products in an attempt to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures.
