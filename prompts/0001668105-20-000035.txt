Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Talend is a leader in data integration and data integrity. We were founded on the principle that organizations can only maximize the value of their data by putting powerful yet easy-to-use solutions in the hands of users. Our mission is to provide data intelligence for all users by delivering trusted data when and where it is needed. Our customers rely on our software to better understand their customers, offer new applications and services, and improve operations. 
​
Organizations need data to improve operations and make better decisions faster. We help organizations overcome the barriers that stand in the way of harnessing data, enabling them to discover it across systems, aggregate it to power analytics, clean it to correct errors, transform it through machine learning, share it across internal and external stakeholders and govern it holistically through our open source solution, Talend Open Studio, and our paid solution, Talend Data Fabric, a unified platform that provides enhanced software capabilities and customer support services.
Talend Data Fabric consists of a suite of applications that enables users to collect, transform, govern, and share data. It allows organizations to use data to make better strategic decisions, enhance customer experience and drive long-term business value. We provide Talend Data Fabric as a cloud service or an on-premise deployment. Our platform supports running data processing anywhere – in on-premise, hybrid and multi-cloud environments – managed from a central location to deliver end-to-end trusted data that is correct, complete, comparable and credible. 
We are a recognized leader in the hybrid and cloud data integration market. In August 2019, Gartner identified us as a Leader in its report titled Magic Quadrant for Data Integration Tools for the fourth consecutive year and in March 2019, Gartner also named Talend a leader in its report titled Magic Quadrant for Data Quality Tools for the second time in a row. 
As the need to leverage data escalates, so too does the need to ingest, integrate, improve data quality, and share data throughout today’s enterprises. At the same time, trust and quality issues prevent companies from providing true data intelligence –access to the right data by the right people at the right time. International Data Corporation (“IDC”) reports that users spend only 19% of their time on analyzing data, with the remaining 81% on preparing and managing the data. These are some of the issues in the data landscape that Talend helps organizations address by turning their data into a strategic asset that powers their business and unlocks value.
Our platform addresses the markets for Data Integration and Integrity Software, Applied Master Data Management, and Integration and Orchestration Middleware, which IDC forecasts will grow from $18.5 billion in 2020 to $28.2 billion in 2023. Specifically, IDC forecasts the data integration and integrity software market to grow from $7.7 billion in 2020 to $10.6 billion in 2023. We believe the continued expansion of these markets is driven by the transition in spend from hand-coded integrations to software-based integration solutions given the time consuming and expensive process of manual integrations coupled with the scarcity of personnel with the requisite technical skills. In addition, according to IDC, the market for Cloud Data Integration and Integrity Software is forecast to reach $2.8 billion by 2023, representing a 28% compound annual growth rate from 2020. This significant growth rate represents the rapid expansion and pace of change in the markets underlying our opportunity.
We are living in a time of unprecedented innovation and technological change. Organizations are increasingly challenged to utilize new innovations and realize value from their legacy systems, cloud and open technologies are becoming key buying criteria for data integration, integrity and intelligence solutions, organizations need to have access to and trust the integrity and correctness of their data to make mission critical decisions and organizations need to effectively govern their data in light of the proliferation of new data privacy and data protection laws and regulations. 
​
The rapid evolution of innovation and technological change is driving certain key trends shaping our industry:
​
Transition to the Cloud: Information technology, or IT, infrastructures are shifting rapidly toward virtualized, cloud-based platforms to increase agility and reduce operating costs. As a result, even traditionally on-premise workloads, like big data and legacy back-end systems, are increasingly moving to the cloud and new cloud

architectures are evolving to hybrid/multi-cloud, a mix of services running in public cloud and on-premise. The transformative change in information technology, or IT, infrastructure is driving a dramatic shift to cloud platforms to address infrastructure and data warehousing needs.
​
Modular Software: Software is becoming increasingly modular in response to the changing demands of the business to do things faster, at a greater scale, and at a lower cost. As a result, analytics use cases will be able to become increasingly real-time in nature rather than almost entirely batch as they are today. This shift to modular software is driven by high volume streams of things like sensor data, as well as increasing numbers of self-optimizing systems driven by machine learning.
​
Data Governance: As companies are forced to better account for how they manage data security, stewardship, usability and personal data in light of new laws and regulations, business needs, technological change, and consumer and customer expectations, they will need to implement appropriate data governance solutions. The resulting changes in the approach to data governance that will be necessary to manage data-related risks and liabilities may also present opportunities for organizations to promote initiatives that may lead to greater productivity, faster time to market and new revenue opportunities, including data monetization.
​
Machine Learning: Machine learning is becoming a meaningful driver of data usage. It is becoming key to removing the mundane error prone tasks by revolutionizing automation of the processes of data quality, IT operations support, and detection of anomalies. It is increasingly becoming part of every customer interaction, supply chain order, device, website and application. As a result, data volumes continue to explode, leading to more data and metadata management needs and the emergence of increasing growth of data science teams as companies are building capability to leverage their data.
​
Demand for Self-Service Technology: The proliferation of data, coupled with its strategic importance, has significantly increased business users’ demand for tools to access the data themselves, but the available tools are often limited by the data they can access. This has led to demand for a new wave of self-service tools that allow both IT and business users to collect, govern, transform, and share data more quickly than before. 
​
These trends and the underlying need for trusted data to deliver greater insight, are creating an increasing number of new opportunities for organizations to be data driven. Now more than ever, it is critical for organizations to have an IT strategy that enables them to leverage data to support their business initiatives. To do this, IT teams must be able to work with new data platforms and fluidly address high volume, internet-of-things (“IoT”), self-service and real-time scenarios.

​
Our research and development team is globally distributed in France, Germany, the United States and China. We take pride in our ability to attract and retain the best talent to our team and to create a challenging yet fulfilling environment where engineers can thrive, solve complex problems and find innovative ways to address current and future data integration, data processing and data governance challenges. We follow agile development methodologies, work with the latest technologies and have created a modern, state of the art, flexible and automated software development process that has allowed us to deliver high-quality applications and adapt to market changes and new requirements quickly.
​
Talend has deep roots in the open source community. We believe our open source approach helps us maintain greater transparency, create better software and have happier customers. We have an open source core app that anyone can download, improve, enrich, or extend and we are very engaged with the open source community to get feedback to improve our applications. In addition to our own in-house developed open source projects, we employ open source committers to key shared projects from the Apache Software Foundation such as Apache Beam, ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, Karaf and Syncope that are used in our own technology stack but also in many other enterprise software applications.
​
Backlog
​
Backlog represents the consideration amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from contracts with customers that we believe to be firm and are in progress. Backlog is a measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and may not be indicative of future operating results. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. The timing of our invoices to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our support subscription agreements. For multi-year agreements, it is common for us to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. 

9




Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. The change in backlog that results from changes in the average non-cancelable term of our support subscription arrangements may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenue and therefore we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally and do not believe that it is a meaningful measurement of our future revenue. The backlog values we disclose include anticipated revenues associated with: (1) the original contract amounts; (2) change to the term of the contract for which we have received written confirmations from the applicable customers; and (3) change to the term of the contract for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business. Our total backlog was $46.4 million and $32.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the December 31, 2019 backlog, we expect to recognize revenue of $13.2 million in 2020 and $33.2 million thereafter. 
​
Competition
​
The market for our applications is highly competitive, quickly evolving and subject to rapid changes in technology, which may expand the alternatives available to our customers for their data integration and integrity requirements. Our current primary competitors generally fall into six categories:
​

● | Diversified technology companies that offer data integration solutions, including: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------

​
Intellectual Property
​
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents, contractual restrictions and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
​
Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Further, agreements with our employees and consultants may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies to redress any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
​
As of December 31, 2019, we had one issued patent and one pending patent application. While we have applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we do not believe we are materially dependent on the issued or pending patent to protect our products and we believe the duration of our intellectual property rights are adequate. We may pursue additional patent protection in the future to the extent it would be beneficial to us and cost-effective. We also own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our applications and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
