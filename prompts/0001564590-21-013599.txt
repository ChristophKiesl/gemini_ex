Overview
 We are a clinical-stage bio-pharmaceutical company focused on fighting cancer and other life-threatening diseases by discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs that target cellular metabolism. Tumor metabolism and immuno-oncology have emerged as promising new fields for cancer drug discovery, and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have created fundamentally new potential therapies for cancer patients. With our unique approach, we have established a broad pipeline of small molecule drug candidates that target enzymes controlling metabolically critical pathways in tumor cells and immune cells. We have multiple internally discovered clinical stage compounds that are all enzyme inhibitors. While we are primarily focused on oncology, we are opportunistically developing therapeutics outside of oncology where we can leverage our existing expertise in immune cell metabolism to treat diseases with unmet need.
 Through genetic mutations that alter fundamental metabolic pathways, cancer cells can acquire the ability to grow in an uncontrolled manner, but they also acquire nutrient dependencies that can differentiate them from normal cells. Targeting these nutrient dependencies by inhibiting specific metabolic pathways in cancer cells is a novel therapeutic approach to blocking the uncontrolled growth of tumors. Our lead product candidate, telaglenastat or CB-839, takes advantage of the critical dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. We believe telaglenastat has the potential to be an important new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of a broad range of cancers, and is the first selective allosteric glutaminase inhibitor to enter clinical trials. We retain all commercial rights to telaglenastat and have been granted a U.S. patent, which includes composition of matter coverage for telaglenastat through 2037 in the U.S. and 2032 outside of the U.S.
 We are currently developing telaglenastat in combination with standard therapies in a select set of solid tumors. Our lead development pathway for telaglenastat is for the treatment of KEAP1 or NRF2 mutated non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. According to third-party market research, U.S. incidence of NSCLC is 192,208 with 20% of these patients harboring KEAP1 or NRF2 activating mutations. Recently presented clinical data evaluating front-line standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy treatment for NSCLC patients with mutations in KEAP1/NRF2 demonstrated inferior clinical outcomes compared to patients without these mutations. Thus, NSCLC patients with KEAP1 or NRF2 mutations are a population with an unmet clinical need. Pre-clinical studies have shown that activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in lung tumors makes them dependent on glutaminase activity for growth and survival, and treatment with teleglenastat selectively blocks their growth. In September 2020, we treated the first patient in the KEAPSAKE study, which is a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat in combination with standard-of-care therapy. The KEAPSAKE study will evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of telaglenastat plus standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy as front-line treatment for patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a KEAP1 or NRF2 mutation determined by next-generation sequencing. The double-blind telaglenastat trial will enroll approximately 120 patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC with the KEAP1 or NRF2 mutation. Patients will be randomized to receive telaglenastat or placebo, in combination with pembrolizumab, carboplatin and pemetrexed. The study will evaluate the safety and investigator assessed progression-free survival, or PFS, of telaglenastat plus this standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen. We anticipate sharing interim data from the KEAPSAKE trial in the second half of 2021.
 We were previously developing telaglenastat for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. In January 2021, we announced the results of the CANTATA trial, a 444 patient global, randomized, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telaglenastat in combination with cabozantinib versus placebo with cabozantinib in patients with advanced clear cell RCC who have been treated with one or two prior lines of systemic therapy. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, or PFS. Based on this result, we evaluated our operational and workforce needs to extend our cash runway and ensure long-term sustainability. We reduced our workforce by approximately 35% to preserve cash resources. We currently have no plans to further develop telaglenastat in RCC.
 As part of our Pfizer clinical collaboration, we initiated a trial with the CDK 4/6 inhibitor IBRANCE®, in combination with telaglenastat in July 2019. The Phase 1/2 trial (NCT03965845) of the combination of telaglenastat plus Ibrance is ongoing in patients with KRAS mutated colorectal cancer and KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Encouraging efficacy and safety of the combination was observed in PDAC patients treated in the dose escalation phase of the trial. In November 2020, we announced the expansion of the study to include an additional cohort of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma whose tumors harbor mutations in both KRAS and CDKN2A. Approximately 50 percent of PDAC patients harbor mutations in both KRAS and CDKN2A. 
 Our product candidate, CB-280, is an oral inhibitor of arginase, an enzyme that depletes the amino acid arginine. It is being developed for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or CF. Arginase depletes arginine, which is critical for the generation of NO, or nitric oxide. NO has critical anti-microbial effects in lung and also mediates bronchodilation. CB-280 is a novel oral arginase inhibitor

which is solely owned by Calithera. We completed a Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of oral CB-280 in healthy volunteers. In July 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial in adult patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic airway infection. The randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial will evaluate multiple ascending doses of CB-280, dosed orally twice daily for 14 days, compared to placebo in up to 32 adult CF patients to determine a safe dose range for CB-280. Enrollment in this study is ongoing and we expect to share interim data in the second half of 2021.
An additional arginase inhibitor, INCB001158, was discovered by Calithera and is being developed by Incyte Corporation, or Incyte, for oncology and hematology indications, and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1/2 trials as a monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer agents. 
 We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with expertise in biology and chemistry, and our ongoing research efforts are focused on discovering additional product candidates for the treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases. We have discovered the clinical candidate CB-708, a potent, selective, orally administered small molecule that inhibits CD73, an enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate to generate the immunosuppressive agent adenosine.
 We have also identified CB-668, an investigational first-in-class, potent, orally administered IL4I1 inhibitor as a novel immuno-oncology approach to cancer. IL4I1 is expressed by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells and metabolizes phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan to produce hydrogen peroxide, an inhibitor of T-cell function, and kynurenic acid an immunosuppressive metabolite. In syngeneic mouse models CB-668 exhibited immune mediated, single agent activity and augmented activity in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. IL4I1 expression has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes and expression is elevated in multiple tumor types including ovarian and B-cell tumors.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be the leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel small molecule drugs to address unmet medical needs resulting from diseases affecting tumor and immune cell biology. Leveraging the potentially broad applicability of our tumor and immune metabolism expertise, our primary focus is in oncology, though we are opportunistically developing therapeutics outside of oncology where we can utilize existing expertise to treat diseases with unmet needs. The key elements of our strategy are to:
 
 
• | Develop telaglenastat for the treatment of NRF2/KEAP1 mutated tumors including non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. The NRF2/KEAP1 pathway is known to drive the development of certain cancers, including 20-25% of NSCLC, through the regulation of reactive oxygen species, or ROS, in a manner that requires glutaminase activity. Recently presented clinical data evaluating front-line standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy treatment in NSCLC patients with mutations in KEAP1/NRF2 demonstrated inferior clinical outcomes compared to patient without these mutations. Multiple in vivo preclinical models have demonstrated that activation of this pathway accelerates tumor formation and growth. In addition to making tumor models more aggressive, the activation of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway in these models also makes them very sensitive to the inhibition of glutaminase activity by telaglenastat, or CB-839. The clear mechanistic rationale, strong preclinical data, and high unmet medical need in the NSCLC population have motivated a clinical study that is evaluating telaglenastat, in combination with standard of care chemo-immunotherapy in front line NSCLC patients with tumors that harbor mutations in either KEAP1 or NRF2 that activate this pathway. We anticipate sharing interim data from the KEAPSAKE trial in the second half of 2021.

• | Advance the clinical development of telaglenastat for the treatment of additional cancers. Mutated oncogenes can make cancer cells dependent on glutamine for growth and survival and glutaminase inhibitors have synergistic effects when combined with many cancer drugs. Through the use of clinical collaborations, National Cancer Institute and investigator-sponsored exploratory studies, we are developing telaglenastat for additional oncology indications. We have a clinical collaboration with Pfizer to evaluate Pfizer’s CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, also known as IBRANCE®, in combination with telaglenastat.

• | Advance the clinical development of CB-280 as a new treatment modality for cystic fibrosis, or CF. Arginase and the amino acid arginine are believed to be critical in the pathology of cystic fibrosis. Neutrophils accumulate in the lungs of CF patients and secrete arginase, an enzyme that metabolizes arginine and impairs production of nitric oxide, while generating arginine metabolites that may impair lung function. CB-280 is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of arginase. We are enrolling a Phase 1b trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of oral CB-280 in cystic fibrosis patients and we expect to share interim data in the second half of 2021.

• | Apply our insights in tumor metabolism and immuno-oncology to discover and develop additional targets beyond our current clinical pipeline. Our research focus has remained on metabolic enzymes, but our portfolio has diversified into the therapeutic areas of oncology, immuno-oncology and cystic fibrosis. We have two earlier stage immunotherapy programs which include our clinical candidate CB-708, which targets CD73, an enzyme in the tumor microenvironment that produces the immuno-suppressive metabolite adenosine, as well an IL4I1 inhibitor program.

Our Research and Development Programs
 The following table summarizes our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our lead programs. We also intend to develop additional product candidates from our research and discovery efforts in these fields. 
 
The Evolution of Cancer Therapeutic Agents
 Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of aberrant cells in the body, leading to the invasion of essential organs and often death. Unlike normal cells, which grow only in response to carefully regulated signals from the body, cancer cells are able to proliferate largely without external signals. Cancer cells have gained this ability as the result of genetic alterations that change protein expression or function. Invasive tumors, also known as metastatic tumors, which are the greatest threat to patients, typically have multiple mutations, deletions or amplifications of genes encoding key proteins that regulate cell growth. These alterations allow the cancer cell to grow, invade other tissues, and avoid recognition and destruction by the body’s immune system.
 Initially, the pharmacological treatment of cancer utilized non-specific cytotoxic agents that targeted all rapidly dividing cells, including normal cells. These non-specific cytotoxic agents have anti-tumor effects but their use is often limited by severe toxicities. As the understanding of the proteins and pathways that enable cancer cells to thrive has evolved, newer more targeted agents have been developed that block specific proteins that are activated in cancer cells.
 Tumor metabolism and tumor immunology represent two emerging fields for the development of therapeutics that can address the challenges presented in treating cancers with multiple mutations or with mutations that are difficult to inhibit. Certain fundamental changes in the metabolic pathways of cancer cells are observed in many cancer types with different mutational backgrounds. Emerging therapeutic agents that can take advantage of these changes in metabolism have the potential to act broadly against many cancers. Similarly, genetically diverse tumor types have developed mechanisms to escape destruction by the body’s immune system. We believe additional opportunities exist to develop novel therapeutics that can further enhance the cancer-fighting ability of the immune system, either as single agents, or in combination with approved therapeutics.
 Rationale for Targeting Tumor Cell Metabolism
 Cancer cells acquire the ability to grow rapidly and spread to new sites in the body by accumulating genetic alterations in important genes that control growth and survival. These same genetic changes also result in altered metabolic pathways within the cancer cells that fuel the high demand for energy and the production of new proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA needed for rapid proliferation. We and others have observed that many types of cancer cells develop a unique dependence on specific metabolic pathways upon which normal cells are less reliant. Accordingly, when these metabolic pathways are blocked, cancer cells are essentially starved of critical nutrients and stop growing or die, whereas normal cells are largely unaffected.
 5


Rewired metabolic signaling pathways are a hallmark of many cancers. Targeting oncometabolism is a novel therapeutic approach to blocking cancer growth. Many cancer cells excessively consume nutrients, such as glutamine and glucose, to meet increased metabolic demands. Glutamine is a critical fuel for the metabolic demands of cancer cell growth. Glutaminase catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and is frequently overexpressed in cancer. Cancer cells can become dependent on glutaminase in response to oncogene signaling and thus glutaminase is emerging as a novel target for cancer therapeutics.
 Our Programs
 Our Glutaminase Inhibitor Telaglenastat (CB-839)
 Our lead product candidate, telaglenastat, takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. Telaglenastat is a novel, selective glutaminase inhibitor that blocks glutamine consumption in tumor cells and demonstrates synergistic antitumor effects with multiple anticancer therapies in preclinical studies.
Inhibition of glutaminase prevents glutamine from serving its critical roles in nucleic acid synthesis, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, energy generation, and protection from oxidative stress. Telaglenastat produces synergistic anti-tumor effects in preclinical studies when used in combination with multiple classes of anti-cancer therapies. Because telaglenastat has multiple mechanisms for impacting cellular metabolism, it has anti-tumor effects on a number of different tumor types when combined with a variety of different agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents (such as platinum agents and taxanes), immune checkpoint inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors and PARP inhibitors.
 Telaglenastat binds to a site on glutaminase distinct from the glutamine-binding active site, making it a highly selective and unique allosteric inhibitor. Telaglenastat is well-tolerated in part because of this selectivity. We believe telaglenastat has the potential to be an important new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of a broad range of cancers, and is the first selective allosteric glutaminase inhibitor currently in clinical trials. We retain all commercial rights to telaglenastat and have been granted a U.S. patent, which provides composition of matter coverage for telaglenastat through 2037, as well as patents applied for/issued in other territories.
 In February 2014, we initiated three Phase 1 clinical trials to assess the safety and tolerability of telaglenastat in patients with solid and hematological tumors. Most patients in these trials were relapsed and refractory to multiple approved therapies. These studies showed that drug concentration generally increases with dose, and increasing concentration of telaglenastat in blood correlates with increasing inhibition of glutaminase in blood platelets and tumors. The half-life of telaglenastat in blood is approximately four hours. We have observed this dosing regimen provides sufficient glutaminase inhibition at steady state dosing and the average exposure is above levels we are targeting. Telaglenastat is dosed with food on a twice-daily regimen.
 Telaglenastat has been generally well-tolerated using doses up to 1000 mg administered either twice or three times daily. The primary reported treatment-related toxicities with monotherapy telaglenastat observed to date include fatigue, gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting, and constipation), elevations in liver function tests, or LFTs, and photophobia. The majority of these adverse events have been mild to moderate (Grade 1/2) in severity.
 Evaluation of telaglenastat in combination in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with NRF2/KEAP1 pathway mutations
 Effective treatments for patients with KEAP1 or NRF2 mutations remain a large unmet clinical need. According to third-party market research, U.S. incidence of NSCLC is 192,208. Activating mutations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, which occur in an estimated 20 percent of non-squamous NSCLC patients, occur early in tumor development and drive aggressive tumor growth. Recently presented clinical data demonstrate that activation of this pathway through the loss of KEAP1 function results in very poor outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving front line standard of care chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy. In a recently published observational study (Skoulidis, ASCO 2019) the survival of patients with KEAP1 genomic alterations treated with standard-of care first line chemo-immunotherapy was statistically significantly shorter when compared to patients without the mutations (7.8 months vs. 20.4 months p=0.002). 
 Proliferating tumors are metabolically active and can accumulate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway induces the expression of many genes that allow the tumor to better manage these high levels of ROS. A key subset of these activated genes regulate the uptake and metabolism of glutamine and the synthesis of glutathione, making tumors that harbor these mutations dependent on the activity of glutaminase. Multiple in vivo preclinical models have demonstrated that activation of this pathway, through loss of KEAP1 function or a gain-of-function NRF2 mutation, accelerates tumor formation and spread. In addition to making tumor models more aggressive, the activation of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway in these models also makes them very sensitive to the inhibition of glutaminase activity by telaglenastat. Genetic analysis of adenocarcinoma NSCLC tumors from patients indicate that NRF2/KEAP1 mutations occur early in tumor development. The clear mechanistic rationale, strong preclinical

data, and high unmet medical need in the NSCLC population have motivated a randomized clinical study that will evaluate telaglenastat, in combination with standard of care chemo-immunotherapy in front line NSCLC patients with tumors that harbor mutations in either KEAP1 or NRF2 that activate this pathway. 
 In September 2020, we treated the first patient in the KEAPSAKE (NCT04265534) study, which is a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat in combination with standard-of-care therapy. The KEAPSAKE study will evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of telaglenastat plus standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy as front-line treatment for patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a KEAP1 or NRF2 mutation determined by next-generation sequencing. The double-blind telaglenastat trial will enroll approximately 120 patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC with the KEAP1 or NRF2 mutation. Patients will be randomized to receive telaglenastat or placebo, in combination with pembrolizumab, carboplatin and pemetrexed. Patients are stratified by STK11/LKB1 mutational status and the M stage of cancer (M1a-b vs. M1c). The study will evaluate the safety and investigator assessed progression-free survival, or PFS, of telaglenastat plus this standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen. Guardant360 liquid biopsy test will be provided by the study sponsor as an investigational use only, or IUO, testing option for patient selection. We anticipate sharing interim data from the KEAPSAKE trial in the second half of 2021.
 Evaluation of telaglenastat in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
 Telaglenastat has been evaluated in two randomized trials for the treatment of RCC, but is not currently being developed for this indication. RCC commonly exhibits genetically-driven metabolic alterations that increase their dependence on glutamine, which creates opportunities to develop novel agents targeting glutamine metabolism that could improve patient outcomes. In January 2021, we reported the topline results of the CANTATA trial. The CANTATA trial (NCT03428217) was a global, randomized, double-blind trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telaglenastat in combination with cabozantinib versus placebo with cabozantinib in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC who have been treated with one or two prior lines of systemic therapy, including at least one vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF-pathway targeted anti-angiogenic therapy, or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. The CANTATA trial enrolled 444 patients at multiple centers globally. Exelixis, Inc. provided cabozantinib for the trial through a material supply agreement with Calithera. As compared to treatment with cabozantinib, the combination of telaglenastat and cabozantinib did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression free survival, or PFS, in the study population. The primary study endpoint is PFS by blinded independent review. The hazard ratio was 0.94 (p=0.65). Median PFS was 9.2 months among patients treated with telaglenastat and cabozantinib as compared to 9.3 months with cabozantinib and placebo. Sixty-two percent of patients were treated with prior PD(L)-1 containing therapy, and the arms were well balanced. The frequency and severity of adverse events in the telaglenastat-treated population were comparable to that of cabozantinib alone. We have submitted the results for presentation at a medical meeting. 
 The ENTRATA trial (NCT03163667) was a Phase 2 randomized, double blind trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telaglenastat in combination with everolimus versus placebo with everolimus in patients with advanced clear cell RCC who have been treated with at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, including at least one VEGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The trial opened for enrollment in August 2017 and completed enrollment in January 2019. The trial enrolled 69 patients at multiple centers in the United States and results were presented earlier this year. Key demographics were balanced between the two treatment arms. Patients enrolled were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior lines of therapy for advanced metastatic disease including 70% (72% vs. 65% in telaglenastat and placebo arms, respectively) with two or more prior TKIs, and 68% (70% vs. 65%) with intermediate/poor MSKCC prognostic score. Eighty-eight percent of patients received prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (91% vs. 83%). Telaglenastat, when added to everolimus, doubled the median PFS to 3.8 months as compared to 1.9 months for everolimus alone and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 36% (HR=0.64, p=0.079 one-sided). The primary endpoint of the trial was PFS per investigator assessment with a predetermined threshold of p ≤ 0.2 one-sided. Overall response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1) was 2.2% vs. 0%, and stable disease was 56.5% vs. 47.8%. Based on a data cutoff of September 30, 2020, the median overall survival is 14.4 months vs. 9.7 months in the telaglenastat and control arms, respectively (HR=0.80, p=0.24 one-sided).
 Frequency of all-grade adverse events in the telaglenastat-containing arm were comparable to that of everolimus alone. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 80.4% of patients in the telaglenastat plus everolimus arm versus 60.9% in the everolimus plus placebo arm. The most frequently reported Grade ≥ 3 adverse events in the treatment versus control arms, respectively, were anemia (17.4% vs. 17.4%), pneumonia (6.5% vs. 4.3%), abdominal pain (6.5% vs. 0%), thrombocytopenia (6.5% vs. 0%), and fatigue (4.3% vs. 8.7%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation of any study drug were comparable (28.3% vs. 30.4%).
 Evaluation of telaglenastat in combination with palbociclib (Ibrance)
 In October 2018, we announced a collaboration with Pfizer to evaluate the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance) in combination with telaglenastat for the treatment of patients with KRAS mutated colorectal cancer and patients with KRAS mutated

non-small cell lung cancer. Preclinical data suggest that telaglenastat, which is designed to starve tumor cells of the key nutrient glutamine, synergizes with CDK4/6 inhibitors by enhancing cell cycle arrest and blocking cancer cell proliferation. The combination of telaglenastat with CDK4/6 inhibitors has demonstrated synergistic activity in a number of preclinical cancer models, including colorectal cancer, or CRC, non-small cell lung carcinoma, or NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and ER+ breast cancer. Based on these data, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of the combination of telaglenastat plus palbociclib in patients with KRAS mutated CRC and patients with KRAS mutated NSCLC in July 2019. The Phase 1/2 trial (NCT03965845) of the combination of telaglenastat plus Ibrance has been evaluating patients with KRAS mutated colorectal cancer and KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer. In the ongoing trial, encouraging efficacy and safety of the combination was observed in PDAC patients treated in the dose escalation phase of the trial. In November 2020, we announced the expansion of the study to include an additional cohort of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma whose tumors harbor mutations in both KRAS and CDKN2A. Approximately 50 percent of PDAC patients harbor mutations in both KRAS and CDKN2A. In preclinical studies with KRAS-mutated cancer models, telaglenastat showed synergistic anti-tumor effects when used in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, enhancing cell cycle arrest and blocking cancer cell proliferation.
 Evaluation of telaglenastat in additional indications
 Telaglenastat is also the subject of several additional investigator-sponsored clinical trials and is available under the NIH/NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, or CTEP, collaborative agreement for clinical and non-clinical studies. Investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trials are ongoing and recruiting patients with PIK3CA mutant CRC, RAS wild-type CRC and myelosdysplastic syndrome, or MDS. A clinical trial in patients with PIK3CA mutant CRC is ongoing at Case Western and Cleveland Clinic. This research is supported by a Stand Up To Cancer Colorectal Cancer Dream Team Translational Research Grant (Grant Number: SU2C-AACR-DT22-17). As of the June 2018 data presentation, 16 patients have been enrolled, including 12 patients with CRC. CRC patients must have progressed on prior fluoropyrimidine-containing therapy. In the dose escalation phase of the trial, there were no dose limiting toxicities and telaglenastat plus capecitabine was well tolerated at the full dose of telaglenastat. All late-line CRC patients had progressed on at least one prior fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen. For CRC patients with PIK3CA-mutated cancer (n=7), the median PFS was 26 weeks and for patients with PIK3CA wild-type cancer (n=5) the median PFS was 16 weeks (p=0.058). These results compare favorably to historical data in third line CRC patients receiving standard of care therapies, where the median PFS is approximately 8 weeks. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion of this study in patients with PIK3CA mutant colorectal cancer is ongoing. Additional investigator sponsored trials include the following:
 •A clinical trial in patients with KRAS wild-type CRC is ongoing at Vanderbilt evaluating telaglenastat plus panitumumab in anti-EGFR-refractory patients. Dose escalation is complete and the Phase 2 portion of this trial is ongoing. 
 •A clinical trial in patients with high risk MDS is ongoing at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Phase 2 is ongoing and an interim analysis was presented at the 2020 American Society of Hematology Annual meeting. As of the data cutoff of July 2020, 23 patients had been enrolled and 6 patients remained on study.  
 •A clinical trial in patients with platinum resistant BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer is ongoing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham evaluating teleglenastat plus niraparib. 
 In addition to the investigator sponsored trials, a total of five NIH/NCI CTEP trials are ongoing. These trials include the following:
 •A study of telaglenastat in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma
 •A study of telaglenastat plus radiation therapy and temozolomide in patients with IDH mutant glioma
 •A study of telaglenastat plus osimertinib in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC 
 •A study of telaglenastat monotherapy in patients with solid tumors with NF1, KEAP1/NRF2 or STK11 mutations
 •A study of telaglenastat plus sapanisertib in patients with advanced NSCLC with KEAP1/NRF2/STK11 mutations 
 Preclinical Activity of Telaglenastat
 Telaglenastat is a novel, selective glutaminase inhibitor that blocks glutamine consumption in tumor cells and demonstrates synergistic antitumor effects with multiple anticancer therapies in preclinical studies. Telaglenastat targets an allosteric binding site that is highly specific for glutaminase. Inhibition of glutaminase prevents glutamine from serving its critical roles in nucleic acid synthesis, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, energy generation, and protection from oxidative stress. Single-agent telaglenastat blocks growth and survival in glutamine-dependent cancer cell lines and tumor xenograft models.

At plasma concentrations of telaglenastat of 300 nM or above, maximal effects on glutamine and glutamate levels in tumors were observed. In contrast, normal tissues in the same animals showed only small changes in the levels of glutamine and glutamate, despite exposure to high levels of telaglenastat. We believe that normal cells and tissues can utilize other pathways to produce glutamate, whereas most tumor cells have been genetically re-wired to be highly reliant on glutaminase as their principal source of glutamate. This provides a potential explanation for why high doses of telaglenastat are well tolerated in animals.
 Inhibition of glutaminase also results in the reduction of the antioxidant molecule glutathione. The master transcriptional regulator NRF2 induces more than 200 genes related to antioxidant stress including genes responsible for glutathione biosynthesis. Somatic mutations in the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway are present in lung cancers, head and neck cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancer types. Lung cancer models with NRF2/KEAP1 pathway mutations showed marked sensitivity to inhibition by telaglenastat which is believed to be due to pronounced dependence on tumor cell glutathione production that is blocked by glutaminase inhibition.
 Telaglenastat produces synergistic antitumor effects in preclinical studies when used in combination with multiple classes of standard-of-care anticancer therapies. Telaglenastat acted synergistically when combined with drugs that target the Ras/Raf and PI3K/mTOR branches of growth factor signaling pathways. The two agents acting together have a greater effect on the growth and survival of tumor cells than either agent used separately. Telaglenastat was synergistic with the epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, inhibitor erlotinib (marketed as Tarceva®) in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC cells, with the multikinase inhibitors sunitinib (marketed as Sutent®), sorafenib (marketed as Nexavar®), trametinib (marketed as Mekinist®), selumetinib (in development), pazopanib (marketed as Votrient®), and cabozantinib (marketed as Cabometyx®) and the mTOR inhibitors everolimus (marketed as Afinitor®) and temsirolimus (marketed as Toricel®) in RCC, cells. We believe these synergistic activities likely result from the fact that growth factor pathways also control tumor metabolism and ultimately tumor cell dependence on glutamine and glucose.
 Glutaminase inhibition blocks the formation of key metabolic intermediates needed for nucleotide synthesis in cancer cells and enhances the activity of DNA synthesis blocking agents, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, and DNA repair inhibitors, such as PARP inhibitors. Telaglenastat is synergistic with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in ER+, estrogen-resistant breast cancer lines, which results from enhanced cell cycle blockade. Furthermore, telaglenastat was recently shown to induce double-strand DNA breaks in tumor cells and had synergistic activity in vitro and in vivo in RCC cell lines with the PARP inhibitor olaparib (marketed as Lynparza®).
 In preclinical models, telaglenastat enhances the antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors by relieving nutrient competition in the tumor microenvironment, which potentially supports T-cell function. Telaglenastat also acted synergistically when combined with I-O drugs that inhibited the PD-1/PD-L1 immune cell checkpoint. Because many tumor cells consume large quantities of glutamine, an important nutrient for T-cells and NK cells, the tumor microenvironment is thought to be severely depleted of this nutrient. We believe that T-cells and NK cells benefit indirectly from treatment with telaglenastat by the increased availability of glutamine in the tumor microenvironment. Telaglenastat significantly increased the number of tumor regressions observed in syngeneic mice bearing CT-26 colorectal tumors when used in combination with an anti-PD‑1 checkpoint inhibitor. Similar activity was observed when an anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor was used in combination with telaglenastat. Anti PD-1 is known to increase glucose utilization in T-cells, and we believe that telaglenastat, by blocking tumor consumption of glutamine, increases the concentration of glutamine in the tumor microenvironment to further activate and stimulate the proliferation of T-cells and NK cells.
 In IND-enabling toxicity studies, telaglenastat was well tolerated, with no dose limiting toxicities observed. The plasma concentration of telaglenastat measured at the highest dose in rats in these studies was greater than ten-fold above the 300 nM concentration required in mice to achieve maximal effects on glutamine and glutamate levels in tumors and suppress tumor growth. In independent studies, telaglenastat was shown to distribute broadly to all tissues except the brain, indicating that glutaminase could be strongly inhibited in normal tissues without causing any major toxicological effects.
 Arginase Inhibitor CB-280
 Arginase has been proposed to be critical in the pathophysiology of several non-oncology diseases, including cystic fibrosis, or CF. CF patients have a mutation in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator, or CFTR, making them particularly susceptible to progressive loss in lung function. Airway disease in CF has a complex pathophysiology and, despite recent advances in developing therapies for CF, there still remains an unmet need. CB-280 is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of arginase. Neutrophils accumulate in the lungs of CF patients and secrete arginase. Sputum from patients with CF has elevated arginase activity leading to diminished arginine levels. Reduced arginine is thought to exacerbate pulmonary disease in CF by impairing production of nitric oxide, leading to a diminished anti-microbial response and impaired airway function. It is known that airways of patients with CF have lower than normal nitric oxide, or NO, production, and lower NO levels directly correlate with worsened lung 
 9


function and increased colonization with pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Research in CF patients has demonstrated that increasing arginine levels can increase the production of nitric oxide and improve lung function. In addition, published preclinical data also demonstrated that arginine-dependent NO-based signaling was associated with increased function of the CFTR (Wu et al. Molecular Pharmacology 2019). The result was that the use of an arginase inhibitor improved the function of delta 508 mutant CFTR in the presence or absence of a CFTR modulator as demonstrated by a change FLIPR fluorescence from baseline.
 We, along with our pre-clinical collaborators, have validated arginase inhibitors in mouse models of CF. In October 2020, we presented a trial in progress poster detailing the trial design at the North American Cystic Fibrosis 2020 Virtual Conference. The poster presentation includes preclinical study results which suggest CB-280 significantly improved lung function and reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa colony-forming units in pre-clinical models. Arginase inhibition with CB-280 resulted in improved central airway resistance in CFTR knockout mice, and decreased lung infection in wild type and DeltaF508-CFTR-expressing mice infected with Pseudomonas. Based on pre-clinical studies in a mouse model of CFTR-mutated CF, we believe that arginase inhibition can lead to reduced infection and improved lung function in CF patients and that these data support the clinical development of CB-280 in CF. In February 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 trial conducted under an IND application. The first-in-human Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose trial, which is now complete, evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of oral CB-280 in healthy volunteers. A Phase 1b clinical study in CF patients was initiated in July 2020, evaluating multiple doses of CB-280 compared to placebo in 32 adult CF patients to determine a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, range for CB-280 in CF patients. Patients at study entry must be stable on CF background therapies with FEV1 40-90% of predicted. Patients will receive CB-280 or placebo for 14 days; lung function as well as microbes in sputum will be evaluated. A dose-finding expansion of this study is planned in which additional cohorts of patients will receive different doses of CB-280 or placebo for 28 days in order to select the optimal dose of CB-280 to improve lung function. For the entire study, patients will continue their existing therapies for CF (including CFTR modulators). 
 
In November 2020, we were awarded up to $2.4 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
 Under our collaboration agreement with Incyte, we retained the sole right to develop and commercialize CB-280 in specific non-oncology rare disease indications, including CF. Arginase is also thought to play an important pathophysiologic role in several other diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases, primary pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and others. 
 Arginase Inhibitor INCB001158
 Immune surveillance is the process whereby the body identifies pathogens as well as abnormal cells that are either infected with viruses or have become cancerous. Upon recognition of foreign or abnormal cells, a number of immune processes are activated to allow the body to attack and clear cells. However, excessive or inappropriate activation of the immune system can have negative consequences such as autoimmune disease, inflammation, or maternal-fetal rejection. Compensatory mechanisms have evolved to control excessive inflammatory activity by dampening the immune stimulation. Cancerous cells that successfully evade immune surveillance do so, in part, by blocking or reducing immune-stimulatory and/or enhancing immune-inhibitory activities. Immuno-oncology therapies interfere with mechanisms that tumors have used to dampen the immune response.
 Tumors have evolved a number of strategies to avoid recognition and destruction by the immune system. One key mechanism is through suppression of cytotoxic T-cells that would otherwise attack and kill the cancer cells. Arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic T-cells. Without arginine, tumor specific cytotoxic T-cells fail to activate, proliferate, and mount an effective anti-tumor response.
 In response to tumor-secreted factors, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, and neutrophils accumulate in the tumor and secrete the enzyme arginase, resulting in depletion of arginine from the tumor microenvironment. Significant infiltration by arginase-expressing myeloid cells has been reported in many solid tumor types including lung cancer, colorectal esophageal, bladder, head and neck, kidney cancer, and other tumor types. We have confirmed that arginase-expressing MDSCs are found by immunohistochemistry, or IHC, in a wide range of tumor types including non-small cell lung (both adenocarcinoma and squamous types), gastrointestinal cancers and bladder cancers. Arginase enzyme levels are elevated in the plasma of cancer patients across a wide range of malignancies. We believe that arginase inhibitors can promote an anti-tumor immune response by restoring arginine levels, thereby allowing activation of the body’s cytotoxic T-cells.
 INCB001158, a potent and selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of the enzyme arginase, was discovered by us and is being developed with Incyte. Arginase depletes arginine, a nutrient that is critical for the activation and proliferation of the body’s cancer-fighting immune cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer (NK)-cells. During normal activation of the immune system, arginase, which is expressed by suppressive myeloid immune cells, plays an important role in halting T-cell proliferation. But in many tumors, including lung, gastrointestinal, bladder, renal cancer, squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, and acute myeloid leukemia, 
 10


arginase-expressing myeloid cells accumulate and maintain an immunosuppressive environment, blocking the ability of T-cells and NK-cells to kill cancer cells. We believe that inhibitors of arginase can promote an anti-tumor immune response by restoring arginine levels, thereby allowing activation of the body’s own immune cells, including cytotoxic T-cells and NK-cells. INCB001158 entered clinical trials in September 2016 and is currently being tested in four ongoing clinical trials. The first Phase 1b/2 trial (NCT02903914) is designed to evaluate the safety and recommended Phase 2 dose of INCB001158 as a mono-therapy and in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. 
 A second clinical trial (NCT03314935) designed to evaluate INCB001158 in combination with chemotherapy opened for enrollment in November 2017. The Phase 1/2 trial in patients with solid tumors (including metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, biliary tract cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer), is evaluating INCB001158 administered orally twice daily with either FOLFOX, gemcitabine/cisplatin or paclitaxel. Primary endpoints include safety and objective response rate.
 Two additional Phase 1/2 trials are ongoing. One is evaluating the safety and anti-tumor activity of INCB001158 in combination with daratumumab compared to daratumumab alone in refractory multiple myeloma patients (NCT03837509). The other is evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of INCB001158 alone and in combination with INCMGA00012, an experimental PD-1 inhibitor (NCT03910530).
 In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, with Incyte Corporation. Under the terms of the Incyte Collaboration Agreement, we granted Incyte an exclusive, worldwide license to co-develop and co-commercialize our small molecule arginase inhibitors for hematology and oncology indications. In April 2020, we filed a complaint against Incyte in the Superior Court of California, San Francisco County, asserting claims for breach of contract arising out of Incyte’s failure to pay two milestone payments we believe are due under the Collaboration and License Agreement between us and Incyte, or the Incyte Collaboration Agreement. While we remain committed to and confident in the INCB001158 development program, we have decided to opt out of our co-development obligations at this time effective September 30, 2020, as permitted under the terms of the Incyte Agreement, in order to focus our resources on our own internal development programs. As a result of our decision to opt out, Incyte will pay all costs to develop INCB001158 or any other licensed products. In addition, our rights to U.S. profit sharing will no longer be in effect, and instead Incyte will pay us tiered royalties ranging from the low double digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products in the U.S., additional royalties to reimburse us for previously incurred development costs, and total remaining potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestones of $738.0 million (increased from over $418.0 million prior to the opt out). Our rights to royalties outside the U.S. remain unchanged. We will also have no further rights to research, develop or co-detail INCB001158 and Incyte will have the right to take over the conduct of all activities related to the research, development and commercialization of INCB001158 for all indications in the hematology/oncology field.
 In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Arginase License Agreement, with Mars, Inc., by and through its Mars Symbioscience division, or Symbioscience, under which we have been granted the exclusive, worldwide license rights to develop and commercialize Symbioscience’s portfolio of arginase inhibitors for use in human healthcare. Under the Arginase License Agreement, we are responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of the licensed products at our cost, are required to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to such development and commercialization activities, and must meet certain general diligence obligations. We hold the first right to prosecute and to enforce all licensed rights under the Arginase License Agreement throughout the world, and Symbioscience will retain certain step-in enforcement rights. Under the exclusivity provisions of the Arginase License Agreement, each party agrees not to develop any other arginase inhibitors for use in human healthcare outside of the scope of the Arginase License Agreement.  
 Early Immuno-Oncology Programs
 Our research focus has remained on metabolic enzymes. We have two earlier stage immunotherapy programs which include our candidate CB-708, which targets CD73, an enzyme in the tumor microenvironment, as well an IL4I1 inhibitor program.
 CD73 is an enzyme that produces adenosine, a powerful inhibitor of immune function in tumors. CD73 is expressed across a wide range of tumors and tumor infiltrating leukocytes, and often correlates with poor prognosis. Blockade of adenosine production by CD73 inhibition is expected to reverse immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and enhance the immune system’s ability to fight the cancer. We have developed an orally-bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73, CB-708, that has anti-tumor activity in mouse syngeneic models both as monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors as well as chemotherapy. Preclinical data were presented at the 2019 American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in April and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting in November demonstrating that CB-708 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CD73 that has immune-mediated, single agent activity in syngeneic mouse tumor models. In pre-clinical studies CB-708 was well-tolerated and shows enhanced anti-tumor activity when combined with either an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy or with chemotherapeutic agents, such 
 11


as oxaliplatin or doxorubicin. Despite the promising preclinical data on CB-708, we have chosen to de-prioritized development of this program at this time and we do not have any current plans to advance the candidate into clinical trials.
 We have also identified CB-668, an investigational first-in-class, potent, orally administered IL4I1 inhibitor as a novel immuno-oncology approach to cancer. CB-668 is an inhibitor of the enzyme IL4I1, an enzyme that is expressed by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, metabolizes phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan to produce hydrogen peroxide, an inhibitor of T-cell function. In particular, IL4I1 can metabolize tryptophan to kynurenic acid and other metabolites that lead to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical data were presented at the 2020 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting. In syngeneic mouse models CB-668 exhibited immune mediated, single agent activity and augmented activity in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. IL4I1 expression has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes and expression is elevated in multiple tumor types including ovarian and B-cell tumors. We plan to begin a preclinical study in canine lymphoma patients in the second half of 2021. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, including telaglenastat, INCB001158, CB-280, our preclinical compounds, and our core technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business strategy. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 We file patent applications directed to our product candidates, preclinical compounds and related technologies to establish intellectual property positions on these compounds and their uses in treating disease. We are also seeking patent protection for the use of biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment with our product candidates. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 20 issued U.S. patents, 42 issued foreign patents, and approximately 302 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications in the following foreign jurisdictions: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Vietnam. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between April 2031 and October 2041.
 As of December 31, 2020, the intellectual property portfolio for our glutaminase inhibitor program, which includes telaglenastat, included ten issued U.S. patents. Six of these U.S. patents expire between 2032 and 2037 and claim compositions of matter for and methods of treating cancer with telaglenastat. The other U.S. patents expire between 2035 and 2037, claiming methods of treating cancer with telaglenastat. We also have 36 issued foreign patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications and 97 corresponding pending PCT and foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter for telaglenastat and related chemical compounds, as well as methods of using these compounds. This portfolio includes one granted U.S. patent and one pending U.S. patent application relating to methods for measuring biomarkers in cancer patients to identify patients suitable for treatment with glutaminase inhibitors. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between November 2032 and September 2041.
 The intellectual property portfolio for our arginase inhibitor program, which includes INCB001158 and CB-280, includes issued patents and pending patent applications that we have exclusively licensed from Symbioscience as well as issued patents and pending patent applications that we own. This portfolio includes 17 issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications, 150 corresponding pending foreign patent applications, and 50 issued foreign patents directed to various arginase inhibitors, therapeutic methods of using the compounds, methods of making the compounds, and intermediates useful in preparing the compounds. We expect that these patents and patent applications, if issued, would expire between April 2031 and May 2038.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture clinical supplies of telaglenastat and CB-280. Telaglenastat and CB-280 are organic compounds of low molecular weight. Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing telaglenastat and CB-280 for use in our clinical trials utilizing reliable and reproducible synthetic processes and common manufacturing techniques. We obtain our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have any long-term arrangements. In addition, we do not currently have arrangements in place for bulk drug substance or drug product services of telaglenastat and CB-280. We intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide bulk drug substance and drug product services prior to submission of a new drug application to the FDA if necessary to ensure sufficient commercial quantities of telaglenastat and CB-280. Incyte Corporation has responsibility for manufacturing of INCB001158 drug substance and drug product.
 12


Research and Development
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drugs for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 There are also a number of product candidates in preclinical and clinical development by third parties to treat cancer by targeting cellular metabolism. Our principal competitors in the fields of tumor immunology, tumor metabolism, and/or other product candidates in development for advanced cancer treatment include Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arcus Biosciences, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bayer Pharma AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dracen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Incyte Corporation, iTeos Therapeutics SA, Merck & Co., Merck KGaA, Nektar Therapeutics, Novartis International AG, Pfizer Inc, Roche Holdings AG and its subsidiary Genentech, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
 Our primary competitors in the field of Cystic Fibrosis include AbbVie, Inc., Beyond Air Inc., Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., Novartis AG, Novoteris, LLC, Proteostatis Therapeutics, Inc., Translate Bio, Inc., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted drug therapy, and immunotherapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Any product candidates we develop will compete with many existing drug and other therapies. To the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of therapeutics in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These therapeutics in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any product candidate for which we may obtain market approval.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved therapeutics than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 13


The key competitive factors affecting the success of telaglenastat, INCB001158, and any future product candidates we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, synergy with other approved therapies, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our competitors may develop and commercialize therapeutics that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapeutics that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their therapeutics more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party and government programs seeking to control healthcare costs.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States Drug Approval Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implements regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production or purchase of clinical supplies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and IND
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 14


Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.

After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track Designation
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Priority Review
 Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for Priority Review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is accepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for Priority Review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA’s criteria for Priority Review.
Accelerated Approval
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 A sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for breakthrough therapy designation.
 16


Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request), relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license application and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication where orphan designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Overview of FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 We may seek to develop in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. In August 2014, the FDA issued a guidance document that states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The guidance addresses issues critical to developing and obtaining approval or clearance for companion diagnostics and provides guidance as to when the FDA will require that the in vitro diagnostic, which is regulated as a medical device, and the drug be approved simultaneously. The FDA requires in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval simultaneously with approval of the drug.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMs, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase four clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often 
 17


require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Additional U.S. Healthcare Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include, among others, anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute and false claims laws are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with this law. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 We may also be subject to additional federal and state laws related to physician transparency, data privacy and security, and pharmaceutical manufacturer compliance guidelines, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 94 employees, 92 of which were full-time employees, including 26 employees with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these full-time employees, 62 employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. On January 4, 2021, we announced a reduction in force by approximately 35%, which we anticipate the majority to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2021.
Facilities 
 We occupy approximately 54,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California. Our lease term is through January 2024, with an option to extend another two years to January 2026. In March 2021, we entered into an amendment to our lease where we reduced our leased space to approximately 34,000 square feet. We believe that our facility is sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
