•Invest our excess funds opportunistically in real estate situations that we believe can maximize stockholder value.
Tobacco Operations
General.  Our Tobacco segment operates through our two subsidiaries, Liggett and Vector Tobacco. Liggett is the operating successor to Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, which was founded in 1873. Vector Tobacco is a discount cigarette manufacturer selling product in the deep discount category. In this report, certain references to “Liggett” refer to our tobacco operations, including the business of Liggett and Vector Tobacco, unless otherwise specified.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Liggett was the fourth-largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States in terms of unit sales. Liggett’s manufacturing facilities are located in Mebane, North Carolina where it manufactures most of 
Vector Tobacco’s cigarettes pursuant to a contract manufacturing agreement. At present, Liggett and Vector Tobacco have no foreign operations.
The U.S. cigarette market consists of premium cigarettes, which are generally marketed under well-recognized brand names at higher retail prices to adult smokers with a strong preference for branded products, and discount cigarettes, which are marketed at lower retail prices to adult smokers who are more value conscious. In recent years, however, the discounting of premium cigarettes has become far more significant in the marketplace. Since 2004, Liggett has only produced discount cigarettes and all of Liggett’s units sold in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were in the discount segment. 
According to data from Management Science Associates, Inc., the discount segment represented 28.6% of the total U.S. cigarette market in 2020 compared to 28.3% in 2019 and 27.7% in 2018. Liggett’s domestic shipments of approximately 9.2 billion cigarettes during 2020 accounted for 4.1% of the total cigarettes shipped in the United States during such year. Liggett’s market share was 4.1% in 2020, 4.0% in 2019 and 4.0% in 2018. According to Management Science Associates, Liggett held a share of approximately 14.2% of the overall discount market segment for 2020 compared to 14.3% for 2019 and 14.3% for 2018.
Liggett produces cigarettes in approximately 100 combinations of length, style and packaging. Liggett’s current brand portfolio includes:
•Eagle 20’s — a brand positioned in the deep discount segment for long-term growth re-launched as a national brand in 2013; Eagle 20’s represented 62.0% of Liggett’s unit volume in 2020, 59.9% in 2019 and 53.5% in 2018. Eagle 20’s is the largest seller in Liggett’s family of brands,
•Pyramid — the industry’s first deep discount product with a brand identity re-launched in the second quarter of 2009; Pyramid represented 23.2% of Liggett’s unit volume in 2020, 26.5% in 2019 and 32.5% in 2018,
•Montego — In August 2020, Liggett expanded the distribution of its Montego deep discount brand by 10 states, primarily located in the southeast. Prior to August 2020, Montego was sold in select targeted markets in four states. 
•Grand Prix — re-launched as a national brand in 2005,
•Liggett Select — a discount category brand originally launched in 1999,
•Eve — a 120-millimeter cigarette in the branded discount category, and
•USA and various partner brands and private label brands.
Under the Master Settlement Agreement (“MSA”) reached in November 1998 with 46 states and various territories, cigarette manufacturers selling product in the U.S. must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually. Liggett, however, is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds its grandfathered market share established under the MSA of approximately 1.65% of the U.S. cigarette market. Additionally, Vector Tobacco has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately 0.28% of the U.S. cigarette market. We believe our tobacco subsidiaries have gained a sustainable cost advantage over their competitors as a result of the settlement.
Liggett’s and Vector Tobacco’s payments under the MSA are based on each respective company’s incremental market share above the grandfathered market share applicable to each respective company. Thus, if Liggett’s total market share is 3%, its MSA payment is based on 1.35%, which is the difference between Liggett’s total market share of 3% and its approximate applicable grandfathered market share of 1.65%. We anticipate that both Liggett’s and Vector Tobacco’s payment exemptions will be fully utilized for the foreseeable future.
The source of industry data in this report is Management Science Associates, Inc., an independent third-party data management organization that collects wholesale and retail shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers and distributors and provides analysis of market share unit sales volume for individual companies and the industry as a whole. Management Science Associates, Inc.’s information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates developed by Management Science Associates, Inc.
Business Strategy.  Liggett’s business strategy is to capitalize on its cost advantage in the United States cigarette market resulting from the favorable treatment our tobacco subsidiaries receive under our settlement agreements with the states and territories. Liggett’s long-term business strategy is to build incremental value by ensuring its product management efforts provide superior products in the discount market and focusing its marketing and selling efforts on building volume and margin in its core discount brands (Eagle 20’s, Pyramid, Montego, Grand Prix, Liggett Select and Eve) and to utilize its core brand equity to selectively build distribution. Liggett will continue to seek increases in efficiency by developing and adapting its organizational structure to maximize profit potential. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution.  Liggett’s products are distributed from a central distribution center in Mebane, North Carolina to 15 public warehouses located throughout the United States by third-party trucking companies. These warehouses serve as local distribution centers for Liggett’s customers. 
Liggett’s customers are primarily wholesalers and distributors of tobacco and convenience products as well as large grocery, drug and convenience store chains. Two customers accounted for 18% and 12% of Liggett’s revenues in 2020, 17% and 12% of Liggett’s revenues in 2019, and 18% and 12% of Liggett’s revenues in 2018. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are generally limited due to Liggett’s large number of customers. Liggett’s two largest customers, represented approximately 5% and 4%, respectively, of net accounts receivable at December 31, 2020, 2% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2019, and 11% and 4%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition are performed and, generally, no security is required. Liggett maintains appropriate reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded management’s expectations.
Trademarks.  All of the major trademarks used by Liggett are federally registered or are in the process of being registered in the United States and other markets. Trademark registrations typically have a duration of ten years and can be renewed at Liggett’s option prior to their expiration date.
In view of the significance of cigarette brand awareness among consumers, management believes that the protection afforded by these trademarks is material to the conduct of its business. These trademarks are pledged as collateral for certain of our senior secured debt.
Manufacturing.  Liggett purchases and maintains leaf tobacco inventory to support its cigarette manufacturing requirements. Liggett believes that there is a sufficient worldwide supply of tobacco to satisfy its current production requirements. Liggett stores its leaf tobacco inventory in warehouses in North Carolina and Virginia. There are several different types of leaf tobacco, including flue-cured, burley, Maryland, oriental, cut stems and reconstituted sheet. Leaf components of American-style cigarettes are generally the flue-cured and burley tobaccos. While premium and discount brands use many of the same tobacco products, input ratios of these products may vary between premium and discount products. Liggett purchases its tobacco requirements from both domestic and foreign leaf dealers, much of it under long-term purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of Liggett’s commitments were for the purchase of foreign tobacco. 
Liggett’s cigarette manufacturing facility was designed for the execution of short production runs in a cost-effective manner, which enables Liggett to manufacture and market approximately 100 different cigarette brand styles. Liggett’s facility produced approximately 8.9 billion cigarettes in 2020, but maintains the capacity to produce approximately 17.4 billion cigarettes per year. Vector Tobacco has contracted with Liggett to produce most of its cigarettes at Liggett’s manufacturing facility in Mebane. 
Competition.  Liggett’s competition is divided into two segments. The first segment consists of the three largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States: Philip Morris USA Inc. (“Philip Morris”), which is owned by Altria Group, Inc., RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (“RJ Reynolds”), which is owned by British American Tobacco Plc, and ITG Brands LLC, which is owned by Imperial Brands Plc. These three manufacturers, while primarily premium cigarette-based companies, also produce and sell discount cigarettes. The second segment of competition is comprised of a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell deep discount cigarettes. 
Historically, there have been substantial barriers to entry into the cigarette business, including extensive distribution organizations, large capital outlays for sophisticated production equipment, substantial inventory investment, costly promotional spending, regulated advertising and, for premium brands, strong brand loyalty. However, after the MSA was signed, some smaller manufacturers and importers that are not parties to the MSA (“Non-Participating Manufacturers”) were able to overcome these competitive barriers due to an unintended cost advantage resulting from the MSA. These Non-Participating Manufacturers were subsequently impacted by the state statutes enacted pursuant to the MSA; however, these companies still have significant market share in the aggregate through competitive discounting in this segment.
In the cigarette business, Liggett competes on dual fronts. Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds compete among themselves for premium brand market share based on advertising, promotional activities, trade rebates and incentives. They compete with Liggett and others for discount market share, primarily on the basis of price and in store merchandising. These competitors have substantially greater financial resources than Liggett, and most of their brands have greater sales and consumer recognition than Liggett’s products. Liggett’s discount brands must also compete in the marketplace with the smaller manufacturers’ and importers’ deep discount brands.
According to Management Science Associates Inc.’s data, the unit sales of Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds accounted in the aggregate for 74% of the domestic cigarette market in 2020. Liggett’s domestic shipments of approximately 9.2 billion cigarettes during 2020 accounted for 4.1% of the approximately 226 billion cigarettes shipped in the United States, compared to 9.0 billion cigarettes in 2019 (4.0%) and 9.4 billion cigarettes in 2018 (4.0%).
From 2015 to 2019, industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States declined at a compounded rate of 3.4% per annum, however, according to Management Science Associates Inc.’s data, domestic industry-wide shipments increased by 1.5% (approximately 3.4 billion units) in 2020. Despite this increase, which Liggett’s management believes was the result of increased consumer demand related to changes in underlying cigarette purchasing patterns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, Liggett’s management believes that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will continue to decline as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in public places, as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to higher cigarette prices in recent years.
Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds dominate the domestic cigarette market, controlling approximately 74% of the U.S. cigarette market in 2020, which makes it more difficult for Liggett to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market, either of which could have a material adverse effect on its sales volume, operating income and cash flows.
Historically, because of their dominant market share, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, have been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry. Market pressures have historically caused other cigarette manufacturers to bring their prices in line with the levels established by these two major manufacturers. Off-list price discounting and similar promotional activity by manufacturers, however, has substantially affected the average price differential at retail, which can be significantly less than the manufacturers’ list price gap. In addition, in recent years, the discount segment has experienced increased price competition from smaller manufacturers and this has led to more aggressive price discounting of certain “deep discount” brands when compared to “traditional discount” brands.  Consequently, changes in the price gap of products at retail between “deep discount” and “traditional discount” has led to shifts in price segment performance.
Legislation and Regulation
In the United States, tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation, taxation, and litigation, which have a negative effect on revenue and profitability. 
The cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts. The industry faces increased pressure from anti-smoking groups and continued smoking and health litigation, the effects of which, at this time, we are unable to quantify. Product liability litigation, particularly in Florida in the Engle progeny cases, continues to adversely affect the cigarette industry. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which contain a description of litigation.
The harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and, in the opinion of Liggett’s management, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales. Since 1964, the Surgeon General of the United States and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have released a number of reports stating that cigarette smoking is a causative factor with respect to a variety of health hazards, including certain cancers and heart and lung disease and have recommended various government actions to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1997, Liggett publicly acknowledged that, as the Surgeon General and respected medical researchers have found, smoking causes health problems, including lung cancer, heart and vascular disease, and emphysema.
On June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (the “TCA”) became law. The law grants the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although FDA is prohibited from banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products. Among other measures, the law (under various deadlines):
•requires FDA to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages and grants FDA authority to require new warnings;
•imposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products, including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion, as well as the use of brand and trade names;
•bans the use of “light,” “mild,” “low” or similar descriptors on tobacco products;
•bans the use of “characterizing flavors” in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol;
•gives FDA the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (by, for example, requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components, requiring product testing, or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction, constituents, properties or labeling);
•requires manufacturers to obtain FDA review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products which could ultimately result in FDA prohibiting Liggett from selling certain of its products;
•requires pre-market approval by FDA for tobacco products represented (through labels, labeling, advertising, or other means) as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco-related disease;
•requires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires FDA to disclose certain constituent information to the public;
•mandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by FDA as requiring such testing to protect the public health and allows FDA to require the disclosure of testing results to the public;
•requires manufacturers to submit to FDA certain information regarding the health, toxicological, behavioral or physiological effects of tobacco products;
•requires FDA to establish “good manufacturing practices” to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities;
•authorizes FDA to require the reduction of nicotine (although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero) and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents, including menthol;
•imposes (and allows FDA to impose) various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers; and
•grants FDA broad regulatory authority to impose additional restrictions.
The TCA imposes user fees on certain tobacco product manufacturers in order to fund tobacco-related FDA activities. User fees are allocated among tobacco product classes according to a formula set out in the statute, and then among manufacturers and importers within each class based on market share. FDA user fees for 2020 were $24,842 for Liggett and Vector Tobacco combined and will likely increase in the future.
The law also required establishment of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (“TPSAC”) to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to safety, dependence and health issues related to tobacco products. 
Menthol and Flavorings
TPSAC completed its review of the use of menthol in cigarettes and issued a report with recommendations to FDA in March 2011. The report stated that “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States,” but did not expressly recommend that FDA ban menthol cigarettes. In July 2013, FDA made available its preliminary scientific evaluation (“PSE”) of public health issues related to the use of menthol in cigarettes, in which it concluded that menthol cigarettes likely pose a public health risk above that seen with non-menthol cigarettes. FDA also issued and accepted public comment on an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ANPR”) seeking input related to potential regulatory options it might consider in determining what future regulatory action, if any, it believes is warranted. A decision by FDA to ban menthol in tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on us. In July 2014, the federal district court for the District of Columbia ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment in a lawsuit brought by several cigarette manufacturers against FDA challenging the composition of the TPSAC. The district court granted, in part, the manufacturers’ motion for summary judgment, ordering FDA to reconstitute the TPSAC and barring the agency from relying in any manner on the March 2011 TPSAC report on menthol. FDA appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In January 2016, the D.C. Circuit vacated the district court’s decision due to the manufacturers’ lack of standing and lifted the prohibition on FDA relying on the March 2011 TPSAC report. The D.C. Circuit’s decision does not preclude future challenges if FDA ultimately relies on the March 2011 TPSAC report to restrict or ban menthol in cigarettes. 
In July 2017, FDA announced a comprehensive plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation. As part of this comprehensive plan, FDA announced its intent to issue an ANPR requesting public stakeholder input on the impact of flavors (including menthol) on increased initiation among youth and young adults, as well as assisting adult smokers to switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery. In 2020, approximately 19% of our cigarette unit sales were menthol flavored. FDA issued this ANPR on March 21, 2018, seeking comments, data, research results, or other information about, among other things, how flavors attract youth to initiate tobacco product use and about whether and how certain flavors may help adult cigarette smokers reduce cigarette use and switch to potentially less harmful products. In the ANPR, FDA stated that potential regulatory actions include, but are not limited to, tobacco product standards and restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products with flavors. We cannot predict how a tobacco product standard or a restriction on the sale and distribution of tobacco products with menthol, if ultimately issued by FDA, will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.
In December 2019, Massachusetts enacted a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes effective June 1, 2020. Although certain municipalities throughout the United States have banned the sale of menthol cigarettes, Massachusetts is the first state to do so. We cannot predict how the menthol ban in Massachusetts will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than 
other companies in the industry. We also cannot predict whether other states will enact similar bans on the sale of menthol cigarettes. 
Minimum Age of Sale for Tobacco Products
On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Tobacco-Free Youth Act, increasing the national age of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21 years of age. The law took effect immediately. We cannot predict how the change in the minimum age of sale will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.
Advertising and Warnings on Packaging
The TCA imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. For example, as required under the law, FDA reissued certain regulations previously issued in 1996 (which were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2000 as beyond FDA’s then authority). Subject to limitations imposed by a federal injunction (discussed below), these regulations took effect on June 22, 2010. As written, these regulations significantly limit the ability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products, by, for example, restricting the use of color and graphics in advertising, limiting the use of outdoor advertising, restricting the sale and distribution of non-tobacco items and services, gifts, and sponsorship of events, and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for nontobacco products.
In August 2009, several cigarette manufacturers filed a federal lawsuit against FDA challenging the constitutionality of a number of the restrictions imposed by the TCA, including the ban on color and graphics in advertising, the color graphic and non-graphic warning label requirement, limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products, restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising, and the ban on the distribution of product samples. In March 2012, a federal appellate court let stand many of the advertising and promotion restrictions, but held that the ban on the use of color and graphics in advertising was unconstitutional. 
In April 2010, a number of cigarette manufacturers filed a federal lawsuit challenging the TCA restrictions on trade or brand names based upon First Amendment and other grounds. In May 2010, FDA issued a guidance document indicating that FDA was aware of concerns regarding the trade and brand name restrictions and while the agency was considering the matter, it intended to exercise its enforcement discretion and not commence trade or brand name enforcement actions for the duration of its consideration where: (1) the trade or brand name of the cigarettes or smokeless tobacco product was registered, or the product was marketed, in the United States on or before June 22, 2009; or (2) the first marketing or registration in the United States of the tobacco product occurs before the first marketing or registration in the United States of the non-tobacco product bearing the same name; provided, however, that the tobacco and non-tobacco product are not owned, manufactured, or distributed by the same, related, or affiliated entities (including as a licensee). The lawsuit was stayed by agreement of the parties. In November 2011, FDA issued a proposal to amend its trade name restrictions and, in November 2013, the lawsuit was dismissed. FDA’s proposal remains under consideration. We cannot predict the future impact of the proposed amendment.
On March 18, 2020, FDA issued a final rule to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements. This rule requires each cigarette package and advertisement to bear one of eleven textual warning statements accompanied by a corresponding graphic image covering 50% of the area of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and at least 20% of the area at the top of cigarette advertisements. The rule establishes marketing requirements that include the random and equal display and distribution of the required warnings for cigarette packages and quarterly rotation of the required warnings for cigarette advertisements. The final rule provided for an effective date of June 18, 2021, 15 months after issuance of the final rule. The inclusion of new warnings and rotation requirements pursuant to the final rule would likely increase Liggett’s production costs. On April 3, 2020, Liggett, along with other tobacco companies, commenced an action against the FDA in the United States District Court, District of Texas (Tyler Division) challenging the legality of the graphic warning final rule. On May 8, 2020, the court issued an updated scheduling order and granted a joint motion to postpone the effective date of the final rule by 120 days to October 16, 2021. On December 2, 2020, the court granted a motion by the plaintiffs to postpone the effective date by an additional 90 days to January 14, 2022.
We cannot predict whether the court will delay the effective date and/or determine that some or all of the proposed textual and/or graphic warnings, or proposed prominence of the warnings, violate the First Amendment, Administrative Procedure Act, or other legal requirements, or what the impact of such a court ruling will have on the compliance timeline or requirements imposed on industry.
FDA requires each tobacco manufacturer to submit a plan providing for the random and equal display and distribution of the required warnings on cigarette packaging and the quarterly rotation of the required warnings in cigarette advertising. FDA 
must review and approve the plan prior to implementation. Liggett and Vector Tobacco have each submitted a plan to FDA and the plans are currently under review. We cannot predict whether FDA will approve the plans or the timing of FDA’s decisions.
Product Review
The TCA requires premarket review of “new tobacco products.” A “new tobacco product” is one that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007 or that was modified after that date. In general, before a company may commercially market a “new tobacco product,” it must either (a) submit an application and obtain an order from FDA permitting the product to be marketed; or (b) submit an application and receive an FDA order finding the product to be “substantially equivalent” to a “predicate” tobacco product that was commercially marketed in the U.S. as of February 15, 2007. A “substantially equivalent” tobacco product is one that has the “same characteristics” as the predicate or one that has “different characteristics” but does not raise “different questions of public health.”
Manufacturers of products first introduced after February 15, 2007 and before March 22, 2011 who submitted a substantial equivalence application to FDA prior to March 23, 2011 may continue to market the tobacco product unless FDA issues an order that the product is not substantially equivalent (“NSE”). Failure to timely submit the application, or FDA’s conclusion that such a “new tobacco product” is not substantially equivalent, will cause the product to be deemed misbranded and/or adulterated. After March 22, 2011, a “new tobacco product” may not be marketed without an FDA substantial equivalence determination. Prior to the deadline, Liggett and Vector Tobacco submitted substantial equivalence applications to FDA for each of their respective cigarette brand styles.
To date, Liggett has received NSE orders relating to 20 cigarette brand styles. With respect to the first six NSE orders, Liggett discontinued the cigarette brand styles subject to the orders. Sales of these discontinued cigarette brand styles were de minimis. With respect to NSE orders issued in September 2017 relating to 14 cigarette brand styles, Liggett has elected to pursue administrative appeals with FDA. Sales of these 14 cigarette brand styles accounted for approximately 0.7% of the tobacco segment’s annual revenue in 2020. Liggett is continuing to sell the affected cigarette brand styles during the administrative appeal process. Vector Tobacco received NSE orders relating to three cigarette brand styles in November 2017. Sales of these three cigarette brand styles accounted for approximately 0.4% of the tobacco segment’s annual revenue in 2020. Vector Tobacco elected to pursue administrative appeals with FDA and is continuing to sell the affected cigarette brand styles during the administrative appeal process. There can be no assurance as to the timing or outcome of these appeals and adverse decisions on the appeals could require these cigarettes or other cigarette styles to be removed from the market.
On April 5, 2018, FDA announced a change in its process for reviewing “provisional” substantial equivalence applications. These are the substantial equivalence applications for the subset of tobacco products introduced into commercial distribution after February 15, 2007 and before March 22, 2011, that were permitted to remain on the market because substantial equivalence applications were submitted before March 22, 2011. Both Liggett and Vector Tobacco submitted provisional substantial equivalence applications before the deadline for all of their respective cigarette brand styles. FDA announced that it will continue to review the approximately 1,000 pending provisional applications that were determined to have the greatest potential to raise different questions of public health and will remove from review the approximately 1,500 provisional applications that were determined less likely to do so. 
As a result, Vector Tobacco received a letter from FDA in April 2018, advising that FDA does not intend to conduct further review of Vector Tobacco’s remaining substantial equivalence applications that have not yet received a substantial equivalence determination unless one of the following occurs: (i) the new tobacco product that is the subject of the provisional application is also the subject of another pending application submitted by the same manufacturer; (ii) FDA receives new information (e.g., from inspectional findings) suggesting that the new tobacco product that is the subject of a provisional application is more likely to have the potential to raise different questions of public health than previously determined; or (iii) FDA has reason to believe that the new tobacco product was not introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution in the United States after February 15, 2007, and prior to March 22, 2011 ((i), (ii) and (iii) are collectively, the “Conditions”).
Liggett also received a letter from FDA requesting additional information on certain products subject to provisional applications. The letter requested that Liggett certify the date on which each listed product was introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution in the United States between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011. On April 12, 2018, Liggett provided the requested certification for all of the products identified in the FDA letter. On May 21, 2018, FDA sent a letter to Liggett stating that the products identified in the letter would be removed from review unless one of the Conditions occurs. 
We cannot predict whether FDA will deem Liggett’s outstanding applications, including its responses to “Preliminary Finding” letters for pending substantial equivalence applications, to be sufficient to support determinations of substantial equivalence for the products covered by these substantial equivalence reports. It is possible that FDA could determine that some, or all, of these products are “not substantially equivalent” to a preexisting tobacco product, as the agency has already 
done for 20 of Liggett’s applications. NSE orders for other cigarette styles may require us to stop the sale of the applicable cigarettes and other cigarette styles and could have a material adverse effect on us.
In April 2015, a number of cigarette manufacturers filed a federal lawsuit challenging FDA’s March 4, 2015 “guidance” document, “Guidance for Industry: Demonstrating the Substantial Equivalence of a New Tobacco Product: Responses to Frequently Asked Questions.” The guidance document would have required FDA’s prior approval for all changes to the label of a tobacco product that would render the product “distinct” and a “new tobacco product,” even though there was no change to the product itself. Similarly, the guidance document would have required prior approval for changes in the quantity of products sold within a package. The complaint alleged, among other things, that FDA’s guidance was contrary to and exceeded FDA’s authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). 
In September 2015, FDA issued a revised version of the same document entitled, “Guidance for Industry: Demonstrating the Substantial Equivalence of a New Tobacco Product: Responses to Frequently Asked Questions (Edition 2).” The revised version did not materially change the requirements set forth in the prior version regarding changes to product labels and changes to the quantity of products sold within a package. Accordingly, in September 2015, certain cigarette manufacturers filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the District of Columbia challenging FDA’s September 2015 “guidance” document. In August 2016, the court ruled that a modification to an existing product’s label does not result in a “new tobacco product” and therefore such a label change does not give rise to the substantial equivalence review process. Accordingly, the court vacated the revised guidance insofar as it pertains to label changes, but upheld the guidance in all other respects, including its treatment of product quantity changes as modifications that give rise to a “new tobacco product” requiring substantial equivalence review. The parties did not appeal this decision, concluding the litigation.
In May 2016, FDA issued a final “deeming” regulation that extended the agency’s authority under the TCA to other tobacco products not then regulated by the agency, such as e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah. Under the “deeming” rule, manufacturers of the newly-regulated products, including e-cigarettes, are subject to the same TCA provisions and relevant regulatory requirements that already apply to cigarettes.
Nicotine
As part of the comprehensive plan announced in July 2017, FDA said it would focus on nicotine addiction, with the goal of lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes through a product standard developed through notice and comment rulemaking (based upon, among other things, stakeholder comments as well as published literature). On March 16, 2018, FDA issued an ANPR to obtain information for consideration in developing a tobacco product standard to set the maximum nicotine level for cigarettes. FDA stated that it is considering taking this action to reduce the level of nicotine in cigarettes so they are minimally addictive or non-addictive, using the best available science to determine a level that is appropriate for the protection of the public health. In the ANPR, FDA sought comments on a number of issues regarding the development of a tobacco product standard that would limit the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, including: (i) product categories that should be covered by a tobacco product standard; (ii) the appropriate maximum nicotine level and how the nicotine level should be measured; (iii) whether a standard should be implemented through a gradual stepped-down approach or all at once; (iv) the technical achievability of nicotine reduction; and (v) potential countervailing effects, such as the illicit trade of cigarettes containing nicotine at levels higher than a non-addictive threshold that may be established by the FDA. Under the TCA, FDA may adopt a tobacco product standard for nicotine if the agency concludes that such a standard is appropriate for the protection of the public health. FDA may refer the proposed regulation to the TPSAC for a report and recommendation. FDA may consider a wide range of issues prior to the promulgation of a final rule, including the technical achievability of compliance with the proposed product standard. The rulemaking process could take many months or years and once a final rule is published it ordinarily would not be expected to take effect until at least one year after the date of publication. We cannot predict how a tobacco product standard, if ultimately issued by FDA, will impact product sales, whether it will have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.
Certain States may attempt to pass minimum price legislation
The State of Colorado placed a referendum, called Proposition EE, for taxes on cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine products on the November 3, 2020 ballot. Proposition EE was approved by the voters. In addition to raising the Colorado state excise tax on cigarettes, Proposition EE includes a provision that fixes the minimum retail price of cigarettes in Colorado at $7.00 per pack beginning January 1, 2021, thus reducing the competitive advantage of our Company’s discount priced cigarettes in the Colorado marketplace. We commenced litigation against Colorado challenging the legality of the minimum price provision contained in Proposition EE, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. Although no other state has adopted a fixed minimum retail price law for cigarettes, other states may attempt to do so if the minimum price provision in Proposition EE is determined by the courts to be legal. In the event that litigation challenging the minimum price legislation is not successful or other states 
pass similar legislation that withstands judicial scrutiny, the result could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
It is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation or as a result of additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising or labeling of tobacco products.
Liggett’s management believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the laws regulating cigarette manufacturers in all jurisdictions in which we operate.
The MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements
In March 1996, March 1997, and March 1998, Liggett entered into settlements of tobacco-related litigation with 45 states and territories. The settlements released Liggett from all tobacco-related claims within those states and territories, including claims for health care cost reimbursement and claims concerning sales of cigarettes to minors.
In November 1998, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and two other companies (the “Original Participating Manufacturers” or “OPMs”) and Liggett (together with any other tobacco product manufacturer that becomes a signatory, the “Subsequent Participating Manufacturers” or “SPMs”), (the OPMs and SPMs are hereinafter referred to jointly as the “Participating Manufacturers”) entered into the MSA with 46 states and various territories (collectively, the “Settling States”) to settle the asserted and unasserted healthcare cost recovery and certain other claims of those Settling States. The MSA received final judicial approval in each Settling State.
As a result of the MSA, the Settling States released Liggett and Vector Tobacco from:
•all claims of the Settling States and their respective political subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to: (i) past conduct arising out of the use, sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising and marketing of tobacco products; and (ii) the health effects of, the exposure to, or research, statements or warnings about, tobacco products; and
•all monetary claims of the Settling States and their respective subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to future conduct arising out of the use of, or exposure to, tobacco products that have been manufactured in the ordinary course of business.
The MSA restricts tobacco product advertising and marketing within the Settling States and otherwise restricts the activities of Participating Manufacturers. Among other things, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products; bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion; limits each Participating Manufacturer to one tobacco brand name sponsorship during any 12-month period; bans all outdoor advertising, with certain limited exceptions; prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media; bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended recipient is an adult; prohibits Participating Manufacturers from licensing third parties to advertise tobacco brand names in any manner prohibited under the MSA; and prohibits Participating Manufacturers from using as a tobacco product brand name any nationally recognized non-tobacco brand or trade name or the names of sports teams, entertainment groups or individual celebrities.
The MSA also requires Participating Manufacturers to affirm corporate principles to comply with the MSA and to reduce underage usage of tobacco products and imposes restrictions on lobbying activities conducted on behalf of Participating Manufacturers. In addition, the MSA provides for the appointment of an independent auditor to calculate and determine the amounts of payments owed pursuant to the MSA.
Under the payment provisions of the MSA, the Participating Manufacturers are required to make annual payments of $9.0 billion (subject to applicable adjustments, offsets and reductions). These annual payments are allocated based on unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments. The payment obligations under the MSA are the several, and not joint, obligations of each Participating Manufacturer and are not the responsibility of any parent or affiliate of a Participating Manufacturer. 
Liggett has no payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately 1.65% of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Vector Tobacco has no payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately 0.28% of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Liggett and Vector Tobacco’s domestic shipments accounted for 4.1% of the total cigarettes sold in the United States in 2020. If Liggett’s or Vector Tobacco’s market share exceeds their respective market share exemption in a given year, then on April 15 of the following year, Liggett and/or Vector Tobacco, as the case may be, must pay on each excess unit an amount equal (on a per-unit basis) to that due from the OPMs for that year. 
Liggett may have additional payment obligations under the MSA and its other settlement agreements with the states. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.

Douglas Elliman operates as a broker in residential real estate transactions. In performing these services, the company has historically represented the seller or buyer, either as the listing broker for the seller, or as a co-broker for the buyer side of the transaction. In acting as a broker for the seller, their services include assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, advertising the property, showing the property to prospective buyers, and assisting the seller in negotiating the terms of the sale and in closing the transaction. In exchange for these services, the seller pays to the company a commission, which is 
generally a fixed percentage of the sales price. In a co-brokered arrangement, the listing broker typically splits its commission with the selling co-broker involved in the transaction. The company also offers buyer brokerage services. When acting as a broker for the buyer, its services include assisting the buyer in locating properties that meet the buyer’s personal and financial specifications, showing the buyer properties, and assisting the buyer in negotiating the terms of the purchase and closing the transaction. In exchange for these services, a commission is paid to the company which also is generally a fixed percentage of the purchase price and is usually, based upon a co-brokerage agreement with the listing broker, deducted from, and payable out of, the commission payable to the listing broker. With the written consent of a buyer and seller, subject to certain conditions, the company may, in certain circumstances, act as a selling broker and as a buying broker in the same transaction. The company’s sales and marketing services are provided by licensed real estate sales persons or associate brokers who have entered into independent contractor agreements with the company. The company recognizes revenue and commission expenses upon the consummation of the real estate sale.

DE Title Services. DE Title Services provides full-service title insurance services to real estate buyers and financial institutions. DE Title Services acts in the capacity of a title insurance agent and sells title insurance to property buyers and mortgage lenders. DE Title Services is licensed as a title insurance agent in New York and Florida. Its affiliate, DE Title Services of Nevada, LLC, provides title insurance services in Nevada.
Portfolio Escrow. In November 2020, Douglas Elliman acquired Portfolio Escrow, an escrow company based in Southern California. Portfolio Escrow is licensed and governed by the California Department of Financial Protection and is a neutral third party that is contracted to uphold the real estate purchase contract. After execution of the purchase contract, purchase funds are deposited by the buyer into a Portfolio Escrow trust account. After all parties agree that all contingencies of the sale contract have been satisfied, Portfolio Escrow delivers all pertinent documents for recording to the appropriate County Clerk’s Office and, then, releases funds to the seller and any other agreed upon entity. Portfolio Escrow, as an escrow holder, is paid a fee equal to a percentage of the sales price.
elliman.com. Douglas Elliman’s website, elliman.com, serves as a destination where consumers can search properties throughout all regions serviced by Douglas Elliman and access current market information on all of those regions as well as comprehensive building and neighborhood guides and other interactive content. 
Marketing.  Douglas Elliman offers real estate sales and marketing and relocation services, which are marketed by a multimedia program. This program includes direct mail, newspaper, internet, catalog, radio and television advertising and is conducted throughout Douglas Elliman’s operating areas. In addition, the integrated nature of the real estate brokerage companies’ services is designed to produce a flow of customers between their real estate sales and marketing business.
Competition.  The real estate brokerage business is highly competitive. However, Douglas Elliman believes that its ability to offer its customers a range of inter-related services and its level of residential real estate sales and marketing help position it to meet the competition and improve its market share.
In the brokerage company’s traditional business of residential real estate sales and marketing, it competes with multi-office independent real estate organizations and, to some extent, with franchise real estate organizations, such as RE/MAX, Century 21 Real Estate, Coldwell Banker Real Estate, Keller Williams, Sotheby’s International Realty, EXIT Realty, ERA, United Country, Weichert, Better Homes and Gardens, and other privately-owned companies. Douglas Elliman believes that its major competitors in 2021 will also increasingly include multi-office real estate organizations, such as Realogy Brokerage Group (formerly NRT LLC, whose affiliates include the New York City-based Corcoran Group as well as Coldwell Banker and Sotheby’s International offices owned by Realogy), Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices of America, Inc., Compass, eXp Realty, Redfin and other privately-owned companies. Specific to New York City, Douglas Elliman’s competitors include 
Corcoran, Compass, Brown Harris Stevens, Sotheby’s International and Warburg Realty. Residential brokerage firms compete for business primarily on the basis of reputation, personal contacts, marketing and public relations services; and, recently, technological innovations and, to a greater degree, commission.
Government Regulation.  Several facets of real estate brokerage businesses are subject to government regulation. For example, the real estate brokerage divisions are licensed as real estate brokers in the states in which they conduct their real estate brokerage businesses. In addition, real estate sales associates must be licensed as real estate brokers or salespersons in the states in which they do business. Future expansion of the real estate brokerage operations of Douglas Elliman into new geographic markets may subject Douglas Elliman to similar licensing requirements in other states.
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) and state real estate brokerage laws restrict payments that real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws may, to some extent, restrict preferred alliance and other arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, settlement services and relocation businesses. In addition, our relocation and title and settlement services businesses, RESPA and similar state laws require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, administration of RESPA was transferred from United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and it is possible that the practices of HUD, taking very expansive broad readings of RESPA, will continue or accelerate at the CFPB creating increased regulatory risk. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes.
Title Services Regulation. Many states license and regulate title agencies/settlement service providers or certain employees and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States sometimes unilaterally lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States also require title agencies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital.
Trade Names.  The “Douglas Elliman” trade name is a registered trademark in the United States. The name has been synonymous with the most exacting standards of excellence in the real estate industry since Douglas Elliman’s formation in 1911. Other trademarks used extensively in Douglas Elliman’s business, which are owned by Douglas Elliman and registered in the United States, include “We are New York,” “Bringing People and Places Together,” “If You Clicked Here You’d Be Home Now” and “Picture Yourself in the Perfect Home.”
The taglines “The Next Move is Yours,” “askelliman,” “From Manhattan to Montauk,” and “It’s Time for Elliman” are used extensively in the Douglas Elliman’s brokerage operations. In addition, Douglas Elliman’s brokerage operation continues to use the trade names of certain companies that it has acquired.
Residential Property Management Business.  Douglas Elliman is also engaged in the management of cooperative apartment buildings, condominium apartment buildings and rental apartment buildings though its subsidiary, Residential Management Group, LLC, which conducts business as Douglas Elliman Property Management and is one of the leading New York City based property managers in the New York metropolitan area according to a survey in the November 2018 issue of The Real Deal. Residential Management Group provides full service third-party fee management for approximately 390 properties, representing approximately 46,500 units in New York City, Nassau County, Long Island City and Westchester County. Among the notable properties currently managed are the Dakota, Museum Tower, Olympic Tower Condominium, Manhattan House, CitySpire Condominium, RiverHouse and The Sovereign, all buildings located in New York City. Residential Management Group employs approximately 258 people, of whom approximately 192 work at Residential Management Group’s headquarters and the remainder at remote offices in the New York metropolitan area.
PropTech Industry Investments
We believe that agents in the residential real estate brokerage industry are increasingly requesting and requiring superior access to technology and back office support services. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate in the future. Consequently, we have increased our focus on investing in the rapidly expanding PropTech industry. PropTech investments offer an innovative approach to enhance the real estate experience by offering research analytics and services around the acquisition, management and disposal of real estate. New Valley, through its subsidiary New Valley Ventures LLC, is actively seeking to capitalize on its unique real estate knowledge and experience by investing in PropTech ventures that will both supplement and enhance the technology-based experience of Douglas Elliman’s agents and the general real estate industry as well as improve the operating efficiency of New Valley.
New Valley Ventures’ investments, all of which are currently $1.0 million or less, include: 
•Rechat – an investment in February 2021 in a mobile-centric real estate agent marketing, customer relationship management and transaction-management software. This investment aligns strategically with Douglas Elliman’s multi-year services agreement with Rechat for its agents.
•MetaProp Venture Capital Fund – an investment in a New York-based venture capital firm. This investment provides New Valley with exposure to opportunities in the emerging PropTech industry. 
•Camber Creek Venture Capital Fund – an investment in a fund which invests in a pipeline of new PropTech ventures. Camber Creek’s portfolio includes Notarize, a digitized notary service, and Curbio, a renovation firm designed to increase a property’s selling price.
Real Estate Investments
We own, and seek to acquire investment interests in various domestic and international real estate projects through debt and equity investments. Our current real estate investments include the following projects (as of December 31, 2020): 
Investments in Real Estate, net
Escena. We are developing a 450-acre approved master planned community in Palm Springs, CA. The development consists of 667 residential lots, which include both single and multi-family lots, an 18-hole golf course, clubhouse restaurant, golf shop and seven-acre site approved for a 450-room hotel.
Townhome A (11 Beach Street). In November 2020, we received, as part of a liquidating distribution from a real estate joint venture, Unit TH-A, a townhouse located in Manhattan, NY. The unit is complete and was actively marketed for sale as of December 31, 2020. 
Condominium and Mixed-Use Development
As of December 31, 2020, we owned investments in condominium and mixed-use development real estate ventures, carried at $68.2 million. We had condominium and mixed-use development real estate ventures, carried at $30.5 million as of December 31, 2020, in the New York City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (“SMSA”). Of these condominium and mixed-use development real estate ventures in the New York City SMSA, all ventures with carrying values of $10.0 million or greater were closing on units or completed as of December 31, 2020, and the remainder had projected construction completion dates between February 2021 and February 2023. We had condominium and mixed-use development real estate ventures carried at $37.8 million in other U.S. areas as of December 31, 2020. Ventures with a carrying value of $36.0 million as of December 31, 2020 had projected construction completion dates between April 2021 and August 2023, while the remaining ventures had been completed as of December 31, 2020.
Apartment Buildings
As of December 31, 2020, we owned an investment in a venture that owns multiple apartment buildings located in the Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan area, which was carried at zero. The investment was operating as of December 31, 2020.
Hotels
As of December 31, 2020, we owned investments in hotels carried at $4.5 million, with ventures carried at $2.6 million located in the New York City SMSA and the remainder located in Bermuda. All but one of the hotels were operating as of December 31, 2020. 
Commercial
As of December 31, 2020, we owned investments in commercial real estate ventures carried at $9.7 million, one located in the New York City SMSA and one located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Both of the commercial real estate ventures were operating as of December 31, 2020.
In our real estate investment business, we seek to acquire investment interests in domestic and international real estate projects through debt and equity investments. We focus on new condominium development in Douglas Elliman markets and investing in well-located real estate assets that generate, or have the potential to generate, long-term, predictable and sustainable cash flows with attractive growth and development potential. We believe our ownership of Douglas Elliman provides us with a strategic advantage through its relationships with developers in jurisdictions where we operate. We and our partners seek to enhance the cash flows and returns from our investments by using varying levels of leverage. In addition, we and our partners may earn incentives on certain investments if the investments achieve rates of return that exceed targeted thresholds. Our real estate investments are located in the United States and Bermuda and we may pursue growth in other markets where we identify attractive opportunities to invest in or acquire assets and to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns. We strive to invest at attractive valuations, capitalize on distressed situations where possible, create opportunities for superior valuation gains and cash flow returns and monetize assets at appropriate times to realize value. As of December 31, 2020, our real estate investment business held interests in joint ventures recorded on our financial statements at approximately $85.4 million and approximately $15.6 million in consolidated real estate investments.
For additional information concerning these investments, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and “Summary of Real Estate Investments” located in Item 7. - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Human Capital
We have long believed that the diversity and talent of our people provide a competitive advantage to Vector and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,275 employees, of which 500 were employed by Liggett, 750 were employed by Douglas Elliman and 25 were employed at Vector’s corporate headquarters.
Liggett. Approximately 40% of the Liggett workforce has been with the Company for more than 15 years. Liggett has maintained long relationships with its employees due to its philosophy of listening to their comments and concerns and regularly engaging them to enhance its human capital management objectives. 
Historically, this has occurred with frequent communication across all levels of the company and in-person events with senior management. We believe this philosophy served Liggett well during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving our human capital objectives. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Liggett’s management proactively took the step of closing its cigarette factory for two weeks, beginning March 15, 2020, for scheduled maintenance and to plan for the necessary COVID-19 manufacturing protocols. Liggett’s management implemented an extensive set of additional protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of its workforce. Among other things, Liggett introduced mandatory mask-wearing, physical distancing and reconfigured certain workspaces in its cigarette factory and the headquarters of Liggett Vector Brands. 
Mandatory temperature screenings are currently being administered upon entry to Liggett facilities. Beginning in March 2020, management provided employees with periodic updates on Liggett’s business, including its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Liggett believes that these initiatives were key in the successful execution of its manufacturing and sales operations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Liggett offers comprehensive benefit programs to its employees which provide them with, among other things, medical, dental, and vision healthcare; 401K matching contributions; paid maternity leave; tuition assistance; and paid vacation time. 
Of the 500 employees at Liggett as of December 31, 2020, approximately 280 were employed at Liggett’s Mebane factory, 165 were employed throughout the United States in sales positions and the remaining 55 were employed in administrative functions supporting and coordinating sales and marketing efforts. 
Of the employees at Liggett’s factory, approximately 200 were hourly employees who are represented by four unions affiliated with either the AFL-CIO or the Teamsters. Liggett has not experienced any significant work stoppages since 1977.
Douglas Elliman. The residential real estate business is built upon personal relationships and we have long believed Douglas Elliman’s team of approximately 750 employees and approximately 6,700 agents distinguishes it from other residential real estate brokerage firms. Forbes recently recognized Douglas Elliman in its 2021 list of America’s best large employers and we believe this recognition is a testament to the hard work and resiliency of the Douglas Elliman family.
While most of Douglas Elliman’s employees are located in the New York metropolitan area, its agents are located throughout the United States in New York, Florida, California, Colorado and New England. In an effort to continue to foster 
relationships with our employees and agents, as well as to address the social and economic impact of COVID-19, Douglas Elliman’s management implemented the following initiatives:
•Hosted, and continue to host, more than 20 company-wide virtual town halls, podcasts and communications across all regions. These town halls are intended to promote a spirit of camaraderie and educate our employees and agents about working in a COVID-19 environment, among other things.
•Converted all of its training and educational courses to its online platform. 
•Continued to support diversity efforts, including sponsoring Aspen Gay Ski Week, matching employees’ and agents’ contributions to NAACP Legal and Education Fund, and various other health and social charitable organizations.
Douglas Elliman offers comprehensive benefit programs to its employees which provide them with, among other things, medical, dental, and vision healthcare; 401K matching contributions; paid parental leave; and paid vacation time.
We will continue to listen, while engaging and connecting with employees at Liggett and Douglas Elliman as well as Douglas Elliman’s agents, to further our human capital management objectives by continuing the initiatives we first began during the COVID-19 pandemic.
