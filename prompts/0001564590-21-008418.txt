Item 1. Business
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “HMH” and the “Company” refer to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, formerly known as HMH Holdings (Delaware), Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. 
 Our Company 
 We are a learning technology company committed to delivering connected solutions that engage learners, empower educators and improve student outcomes. As a leading provider of Elementary and Secondary School (K–12) core curriculum, supplemental and intervention solutions, and professional learning services, we partner with educators and school districts to uncover solutions that unlock students’ potential and extend teachers’ capabilities. We estimate that we serve more than 50 million students and three million educators in 150 countries, while our award-winning children’s books, novels, non-fiction, and reference titles are enjoyed by readers throughout the world.
 We are organized along two business segments: Education and HMH Books & Media (formerly referred to as Trade Publishing). Within our Education division, we focus on the kindergarten through 12th grade (“K-12”) market and, in the United States, we are a market leader. We specialize in comprehensive core curriculum, supplemental and intervention solutions, and we provide ongoing support in professional learning and coaching for educators and administrators. Our offerings are rooted in learning science, and we work with research partners, universities and third-party organizations as we design, build, implement and iterate our offerings to maximize their effectiveness. We are purposeful about innovation, leveraging technology to create engaging and immersive experiences designed to deepen learning experiences for students and to extend teachers’ capabilities so that they can focus on making meaningful connections with their students.
 Our diverse portfolio enables us to help ensure that every student and teacher has the tools needed for success. We are able to build deep partnerships with school districts and leverage the scope of our offerings to provide holistic solutions at scale with the support of our far-reaching sales force and talented field-based specialists and consultants. We provide print, digital, and blended print/digital solutions that are tailored to a district’s needs, goals and technological readiness. 
 For nearly two centuries, our HMH Books & Media segment has brought renowned and awarded children’s, fiction, non-fiction, culinary and reference titles to readers throughout the world. Our distinguished author list includes ten Nobel Prize winners, forty-nine Pulitzer Prize winners, and twenty-six National Book Award winners. We are home to popular characters and titles such as Curious George, Carmen Sandiego, The Lord of the Rings, The Whole 30, The Best American Series, the Peterson Field Guides, CliffsNotes, and The Polar Express, and published distinguished authors such as Tim O’Brien, Temple Grandin, Tim Ferriss, Kwame Alexander, Lois Lowry, and Chris Van Allsburg. In November 2020, we announced that we were beginning to explore a potential sale of the HMH Books & Media segment. Such a sale would be intended to build on the Company’s other strategic restructuring efforts and further align its cost structure to its digital-first strategy.
 Market Overview 
 We operate predominantly within the U.S. K-12 education market, which represents over $740 billion of total spending annually. Specifically, we focus on the U.S. market for K-12 instructional materials and services, which we estimate to be approximately $11.0 billion in size.
 The U.S. Education market comprises approximately 13,000 K-12 public school districts, 130,000 public and private schools, over 3.7 million teachers and 56.4 million total student enrollment across public, private and charter schools. From Fall 2020 to Fall 2029, total elementary and secondary school enrollment, an important driver of long-term growth in the K-12 Education market, is projected to increase by 0.8% to 56.8 million students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

The primary sources of funding for public schools in the U.S. are state and local tax collections, with Federal funding accounting for approximately 8% of public education spending nationally. Consequently, general or localized economic conditions as well as legislative and political decisions which affect the ability of state and school districts to raise revenue through tax collections can have a significant impact on spending and growth in the K-12 Education market. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on tax revenues and other financial resources in some states, which could adversely affect state and local spending on public schools, although it is expected that federal pandemic relief funding will help to mitigate those impacts. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 collectively provide $112. billion one-time emergency support for education through an Education Stabilization Fund, including $67.8 billion exclusively designated for public K-12 education. Public K-12 education has been, and remains, a high priority for political leaders, historically accounting for more than one-fifth of all state and local government spending.
 
Education policy and curriculum choices have traditionally been local prerogatives in the U.S., but Federal law and policy also play an important role. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (“ESEA”), reauthorized in 2015 by the Every Student Succeeds Act (“ESSA”), requires that states, as a condition to receiving Federal education funds, adopt challenging academic content standards, administer annual student tests aligned to those standards, develop systems of accountability tied to specific goals for student achievement, and take measures to identify and support low performing schools. ESSA gives states more flexibility than they had under prior law, but still requires standards-based, largely assessment-driven accountability with a focus on the achievement of students in all demographic subgroups.
 
Title I, the largest program within ESEA, and other ESEA programs provide targeted funding for specific activities, such as early childhood education, school improvement, dropout prevention, and before- and after-school programs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. Generally, school districts are permitted to spend ESEA funds on instructional materials, including core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services.
 
Academic content standards, which are grade-level expectations for student learning, are established at the state level. States generally review and revise standards in each of the various subject areas every six to eight years, and the revision or adoption of new standards typically gives rise to the need for new instructional materials and services aligned to the new or revised standards. Content standards in English language arts and reading in many states are modeled to varying degrees after Common Core State Standards (“CCSS”) and in science after the Next Generation Science Standards (“NGSS”). Both the CCSS and NGSS are products of state-led collaborations. The promulgation of these model standards has led to greater consistency among states’ content standards but has not completely eliminated differences or the need for customized state-specific instructional materials.
 Internationally, we export and sell K-12 English language education products to premium private schools that utilize the U.S. curriculum, who are located primarily in Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. We also participate in the U.S. consumer book publishing market, which is estimated to be approximately $16.0 billion per year according to the Association of American Publishers. 
 Education net sales and billings are derived from Core Solutions and Extensions. Core Solutions products address the core curriculum market with grade-level, educational standards-aligned materials. Extensions products address the markets for supplemental programs, intervention programs, and professional learning. HMH Books & Media products primarily address the consumer book publishing market.

Market Segments 
 Core Curriculum 
 Our core curriculum offerings cover state-level educational standards within a subject and include a comprehensive offering of teacher and student materials necessary to conduct grade-level instruction throughout the entire school year. Products and services include students’ print and digital resources and a variety of supporting materials such as teacher’s editions, formative assessments, whole group instruction materials, practice aids and ancillary materials. 
 Core curriculum programs traditionally have been the primary resource for classroom instruction in most K-12 academic subjects, and as a result, enrollment trends are a major driver of industry growth. Although economic cycles may affect short-term buying patterns, school enrollments, a driver of growth in the educational content industry, are highly predictable and are expected to trend upward over the longer term. 
 Demand for core curriculum programs is also affected by changes in state curriculum standards, which drive instruction, assessment, and accountability in each state. A significant change in state curriculum standards requires that assessments, teacher training programs, and instructional materials be revised or replaced to align to the new standards, which historically has driven demand for new comprehensive curriculum programs. 
 In the U.S., core curriculum is typically selected and purchased at the school district level and, in some cases, at the individual school level. In 19 states, before districts make their selections, programs are first evaluated at the state level for alignment to state academic standards and other criteria. These states are commonly referred to as “adoption states,” while states that do not have a state level review process are called “open states” or “open territory states.” The National Center for Education Statistics estimated the student population in adoption states represented approximately half of the U.S. public school elementary and secondary school-age population in 2020. In some adoption states, districts are required to select materials from the state-adopted list; in other adoption states, the state list serves as a recommendation, and districts are free to purchase and use any materials they choose, whether or not adopted by the state. Adoption states typically review materials in the various subject areas on a six- to eight-year cycle. School districts in those states tend to follow the state review cycle and replace core programs in the year or years immediately following state adoption. In open territory states, each individual school or school district evaluates and purchases materials independently, typically according to a five- to ten-year cycle. As a result, in individual adoption states, purchases of core instructional materials in a particular subject area tend to be clustered in a window of one to three years, while in individual open territory states they may occur over several years.
 Supplemental 
 Supplemental resources encompass a wide variety of targeted solutions that enrich learning and support student achievement beyond core curriculum. Supplemental resources can be print and/or digital, and can include software, workbooks, test-prep materials, formative assessment, games, and apps. Newer technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, combined with more sophisticated algorithms are also driving the rise in supplemental computer-adaptive practice solutions that can both support teachers who are often time and bandwidth constrained, as well as improve personalization of learning for students. 
 Many teachers augment their core curriculum with supplemental resources for additional practice and personalized instruction around particular areas of need, such as Math, Reading, Writing, or Vocabulary. Supplemental materials are purchased by districts, schools, or individual teachers. These purchases are typically not tied to adoption schedules and leverage funding from local, state and federal sources. We estimate this market to be approximately $2.0 billion per year.
 6

Intervention 
 Intervention solutions are generally purchased by individual schools or districts. Demand for intervention materials is significant and growing in the United States. We estimate this market to be $1.5 billion per year. In the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress assessments conducted in 2019, more than 60 percent of public school students tested below proficiency in most grade levels in both literacy and mathematics. These students are strong candidates for intervention programs that are focused on improving outcomes and ensuring students perform at grade level. As demand for digital content and personalized learning solutions is growing, traditional distinctions between core, supplemental and intervention materials and assessments are blurring. 
 Intervention products and services are funded through state and local funding as well as Title I and other federal funding allocations pursuant to the ESEA and IDEA. Title I provides funding to schools and school districts with high concentrations of students from low income families and is often used to purchase intervention products and services. 
 Professional Learning 
 The professional learning market includes consulting and support services to assist individual schools and school districts in raising student achievement, implementing new programs and technology effectively, developing effective teachers, principals and leaders, as well as school and school-district turnaround and improvement solutions. We believe all districts and schools contract for some level of professional services. These services may include support for up-front training, in-classroom coaching, institutes, author workshops, professional learning communities, leadership development, technical support and maintenance, and program management. 
 One important source of funding for professional learning in the K-12 market is Title II, Part A of ESEA, Supporting Effective Instruction. Title II, Part A focuses on the role of the profession in improving student achievement and requires that funds be used to support professional development that is sustained, job-embedded, data-driven, and personalized. There are also significant funding opportunities for professional learning as part of state programs, especially in states that have consolidated program funding and want solutions that are evidence-based. 
 The professional learning market, which is relatively fragmented in the United States, is expected to grow as the transition to digital learning in classrooms increases the need for technology training and implementation support for educators. We currently estimate the professional learning market to be approximately $2.3 billion per year. We believe that the use of interim data, differentiation, teacher content knowledge (in mathematics) and the use of technology in the classroom are the areas in which teachers and leaders are most seeking support. Also, demand for teacher training and professional development opportunities tied to the implementation of new or revised standards at the state level is expected to continue. In addition, the need for new teacher development over the next several years is expected to grow as we continue to see the “greening” of the teaching force, with approximately 340,000 new teachers hired every year and approximately 44% of teachers leaving within their first five years in the profession, a trend that may accelerate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Consumer Book Publishing 
 The consumer book publishing market includes children’s, fiction, non-fiction, culinary and reference titles offered to consumers in print hardcover and softcover, ebook and audio formats, as well as multimedia extensions of the titles, content and intellectual property associated with these titles. Our sales in this market consist of frontlist titles (newly introduced titles, in their first year of publication) and backlist titles (current and updated copyright editions of titles sold after their first year of publication). In addition to new frontlist sales, market growth is driven by extended branding (e.g., movie tie-ins and anniversary releases of backlist titles) and new intellectual property creation (e.g., extension of characters and franchises into additional formats).
 7

Between 201 and 201, the consumer book publishing market grew 0.4% to $16.2 billion, according to the Association of American Publishers (the “AAP”). Since 2015, the same market has increased by 2.6%, or approximately $410 million, according to the AAP.
 Print remains the primary format in which consumer books are produced and distributed and accounts for 74.7% of revenue. Hardback units account for 36.0% of total consumer book revenue despite representing only 24.2% of total consumer book units sold in 2019, per the AAP.
 Digital formats show mixed results as downloaded audio sales grew 15.9% from 2018 to 2019 and 143.8% from 2015 to 2019; however, ebook revenue fell 4.9% from 2018 to 2019 and declined 30.8% from 2015 to 2019, according to the AAP.  
 Our Products and Services 
 We are organized in two business segments: Education and HMH Books & Media. Our primary segment measures are net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. The Education segment is our largest business, representing approximately 81%, 87% and 85% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Education 
 Our Education segment provides connected solutions that engage learners, empower educators and improve student outcomes. The principal customers for our Education products are K-12 school districts, which purchase core curriculum, supplemental and intervention solutions and professional learning services. 
 The Education segment net sales and Adjusted EBITDA were $839.6 million and $145.9 million, $1,210.6 million and $196.9 million, and $1,122.7 million and $210.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with our 2020 financial results being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

By leveraging our leading position in the U.S. instructional materials market, we aim to engage our customers with solutions addressing the variety of instructional needs across the educational achievement spectrum. We believe that by integrating our solutions on a single platform, which uses a common student dataset, and by developing ongoing connections with the teachers who use our solutions, we will be well positioned to increase and sustain market share and grow our Education segment revenues.
 HMH Books & Media 
 Founded in 1832, HMH Books & Media develops, markets and sells consumer books in print and digital formats and licenses book rights to other publishers and electronic businesses in the United States and abroad. Our principal distribution channels for this segment are retail stores (both physical and online) and wholesalers. Reference materials are also sold to schools, colleges, libraries, office supply distributors and other businesses. 
 HMH Books & Media offers an extensive library of general interest, young readers and reference works that include well-known characters and brands. Our award-winning general interest titles include literary fiction, culinary, and non-fiction in hardcover, ebook and paperback formats, including the Mariner Books paperback line. Among the general interest properties are the popular J.R.R. Tolkien titles, the prolific The Best American Series and major cookbook brands such as Betty Crocker and Better Homes and Gardens in addition to recent best sellers including the How to Cook Everything series and The Whole30. 
 In young readers publishing, our list addresses a broad age group and includes recognized characters and titles such as Curious George and Martha Speaks, Five Little Monkeys, Gossie & Friends, Polar Express, Little Blue Truck, and many more. We also publish novels for young adults, a growing genre, including titles from Lois Lowry, author of The Giver, and Kwame Alexander. Our HMH Books & Media business collaborated on the launch of a new animated series Carmen Sandiego on Netflix as part of our strategy to expand our content across media platforms. In February 2019, we also launched HMH Audio with the goal of capitalizing on the growth of downloaded audiobooks; in Fall 2019, we released new audiobook editions of many of our adult and young reader frontlist books, as well as select titles from our substantial backlist.
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, HMH Books & Media net sales and Adjusted EBITDA were approximately $191.7 million and $26.6 million, $180.0 million and $14.9 million, and $199.7 million and $21.9 million, respectively. 
 In November 2020, we announced that we were exploring a potential sale of the HMH Books & Media segment. Such a sale would be intended to build on the Company’s other strategic restructuring efforts and further align its cost structure to its digital-first strategy.
 Seasonality 
 Approximately 81% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from our Education segment, which is a markedly seasonal business. Schools conduct the majority of their purchases in the second and third quarters of the calendar year in preparation for the beginning of the school year. Thus, over the latest three completed fiscal years, approximately 66% of our consolidated net sales were realized in the second and third quarters. Sales of K-12 instructional materials are also cyclical, with some years offering more sales opportunities than others based on the state adoptions calendar. The amount of funding available at the state level for educational materials also has a significant effect on year-to-year net sales. Although the loss of a single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business, schedules of school adoptions and market acceptance of our products can materially affect year-to-year net sales performance. 
Competition 
 We sell our products in highly competitive markets. In these markets, product quality, innovation and customer service are major differentiating factors between companies. Other factors affecting competition include: (i) competitive pricing, sampling and gratis costs; (ii) digitization and innovative delivery; and (iii) educational effectiveness of the program. In addition to national curriculum publishers, we also compete with a variety of specialized or regional publishers that focus on select disciplines and/or geographic regions in the K-12 market. There are also multiple competitors in the HMH Books & Media, supplemental and assessment markets offering 
 10

content that school districts increasingly are using as part of their core classroom instructional materials. In addition, school districts in many states are able to spend educational funds on “instructional materials” that include core and supplemental materials, computer software, digital media, digital courseware, and online services. Our larger competitors in the educational market include Savvas Learning Co. (formerly Pearson Education, Inc.), McGraw Hill Education, Stride Inc. (formerly K-12 Inc.), Cengage Learning, Inc., Scholastic Corporation, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Curriculum Associates, LLC, Benchmark Education, LLC, Accelerate Learning, Inc., and Amplify Education, Inc. Also competing in our market as a substitute are open educational resources. These resources are free, digital solutions that range from supplemental resources to full Core Solutions programs. 
 Printing and binding; raw materials 
 We outsource the printing and binding of our products, with approximately 49% of our printing requirements handled by a small group of suppliers. We have procurement agreements that provide volume and scheduling flexibility and price predictability. We have a longstanding relationship with these parties. Approximately 22% of our printed materials (consisting primarily of teacher’s editions and other ancillary components) are printed outside of the U.S. and approximately 78% of our printed materials (including most student editions) are printed within the U.S. Paper is one of our principal raw materials. We purchase our paper primarily through one paper merchant and also directly through suppliers for limited product types. We maintain various agreements that protect against supply availability and unbound price increases. We manage our paper supply concentration by having primary and secondary sources and staying ahead of dramatic market changes. 
 Distribution 
 We operate three distribution facilities from which we coordinate our own distribution process: one each in Indianapolis, Indiana; Geneva, Illinois; and Troy, Missouri. We also utilize select suppliers to assist us with coordinating the distribution process for a limited number of product types. Additionally, some states require us to use in-state textbook depositories for educational materials sold in that particular state. We utilize various delivery firms, such as United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Freight, etc., to facilitate the principally ground transportation of products. 
Human Capital 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,600 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be good.
Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Following Occupational Safety and Health Administration best practices in our distribution centers, we measure, document and post incident rates for safety transparency; host local employee safety committees at each distribution center; and hold quarterly distribution center safety committee meetings for cross-location collaboration.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and continue to implement additional safety measures in all our offices and facilities including: adding work from home flexibility; adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home; increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures; implementing temperature screening of employees at our distribution facilities and offices; establishing new physical distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite; providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies; modifying work spaces with plexiglass dividers and touchless faucets; implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure; prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees; and requiring masks to be worn in all locations where permitted by local law.
Talent and Development: Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.  In 2020, we provided a company-wide employee engagement survey to all regular employees. We outperformed 
 11

benchmarked peer companies with engagement among our employees in the 86th percentile. Frequent employee pulse surveys were conducted during 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to quickly collect and respond to feedback – including with more activities and initiatives to support our employees. We additionally continue to provide all of our employees with a variety of training and development opportunities. All regular employees have access to Knowledge Network, HMH’s online learning management system offering over 6,000 on demand training courses and programs, live webinars and in-person training opportunities. More than 2,900 employees participated in training programs in 2020, including Unconscious Bias, Cybersecurity, Sales, Product and Compliance Training as well as Leadership and Management Development Workshops, with more than 15,000 corporate training hours logged.
 
Diversity and Inclusion: We embrace the diversity of our employees, customers and stakeholders, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. We take direct actions to attract, hire, and retain more diverse talent, nurture an inclusive workplace, and create opportunities for meaningful conversations about diversity. We aim to increase the diversity of our employee base by growing our diverse talent pipeline, including partnerships with organizations like Resilient Coders, Girls Write Now, Hacker X, and Editors of Color. We have a goal to build a highly engaged team by increasing retention year over year. As of December 31, 2020, our domestic workforce was approximately 67% female and approximately 77% white, approximately 9% Hispanic or Latino, approximately 8% Black or African American, approximately 5% Asian American, and approximately 1% two or more races or other. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 38% of executive management roles were held by women and our executive management team was approximately 77% white, approximately 15% Black or African American, and approximately 8% Hispanic or Latino.
 
As a learning technology company, we are committed to ongoing opportunities for education and growth. This includes formal and informal opportunities for meaningful conversations—from roundtable discussions to company-wide unconscious bias training. Learning and unlearning are lifelong practices that we must actively foster—in our schools, communities, and workplaces. Our cross-functional DEI (“Diversity, Equity and Inclusion”) Council’s work centers around four pillars—leadership, talent, culture, and business—and promotes social justice through Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), DEI trainings, and discussions on how to build an anti-racist community. We have ERGs to support Black and African American, Latinx and Hispanic, LGBTQ+, Asian, disabled and neurodiverse, and female employees, in addition to ERGs focused on mental health and wellness. The ERGs hosted virtual activities throughout 2020.
  Intellectual property 
 Our principal intellectual property assets consist of our trademarks and copyrights in our content. Substantially all of our publications are protected by copyright, whether registered or unregistered, either in our name as the author of a work made for hire or the assignee of copyright, or in the name of an author who has licensed us to publish the work. Ownership of such copyrights secures the exclusive right to publish the work in the United States and in many countries abroad for specified periods: in the United States, in most cases, either 95 years from publication or for the author’s life plus 70 years, but in any event a minimum of 28 years for works published prior to 1978 and 35 years for works published thereafter. In most cases, the authors who retain ownership of their copyright have licensed to us exclusive rights for the full term of copyright. Under U.S. copyright law, for licenses granted by an author during or after 1978, such exclusive licenses are subject to termination by the author or certain of the author’s heirs for a five year period beginning at the end of 35 years after the date of publication of the work or 40 years after the date of the license grant, whichever term ends earlier. 
 We do not own any material patents, franchises or concessions, but we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in connection with our publishing businesses. We believe we have taken, and take in the ordinary course of business, appropriate available legal steps to reasonably protect our intellectual property in all material jurisdictions. 
 Environmental matters 
 We generally contract with independent printers and binders for their services, and our operations are generally not otherwise affected by environmental laws and regulations. However, as the owner and lessee of real 
 12

property, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the remediation of contaminated sites and the handling and disposal of wastes. It is possible that we could face liability, regardless of fault, and can be held jointly or severally liable, if contamination were to be discovered on the properties that we own or lease or on properties that we have formerly owned or leased. We are currently unaware of any material environmental liabilities or other material environmental issues relating to our properties or operations and anticipate no material expenditures for compliance with environmental laws or regulations.

 As a corporate citizen, we accept and promote a community responsibility to minimize our impact on the environment to ensure that we will be able to serve teachers, students and all readers for years to come. As such, we seek to make environmentally responsible choices in our business practices. We set objectives for continual improvement of our environmental and sustainability management procedures. Looking ahead, we are working to expand our company-wide sustainability efforts, setting additional goals and measuring progress in other areas material to our business.
 Responsible Paper Usage
 One of our on-going sustainability focus areas is our approach to how we source, use and dispose of paper related to our products. In 2019, we strengthened and updated our Paper Sourcing and Usage Policy that reflects our continuing commitments to our environment and surroundings. Key 2020 progress highlights were: 99% of HMH purchased paper for education products was manufactured with no less than 10% recycled fiber; 87% of paper we procured domestically for HMH Books & Media segment products was Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified; and 86% of the paper we procured internationally for HMH Books & Media segment products was FSC-certified.
Transportation 
 
A major aspect of our business involves the transportation of our products, and we work to promote environmentally friendly modes of such transportation. In 2020, HMH estimates that it saved 332,000 pounds of CO2 emissions by managing our carbon footprint by consolidating shipments and shipping directly from vendors to end recipients when possible. 
 
HMH participates in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) SmartWay program.  The EPA’s SmartWay program helps companies advance supply chain sustainability by measuring, benchmarking, and improving freight transportation efficiency. Through this program, HMH partners with the EPA to improve our shipping operations to achieve a more sustainable transportation process that directly facilitates a reduction in our carbon footprint. In 2020, HMH estimates that it saved 130,000 pounds of CO2 emissions by participating in the SmartWay program.
 
Waste Management and Recycling 
 
Whenever possible, we aim to recycle our excess product and waste generated at our Distribution Centers to avoid sending recyclable products and other waste to landfills. 
 
•Donation is HMH’s preferred method of disposal for excess books and materials (rather than destruction) and HMH donated more than one million books to 228 organizations during 2020.
 •96% of the waste generated at HMH’s Distribution Centers is recycled.
 
In our corporate offices, each employee has a recycling and a garbage bin.  We work to increase employee awareness regarding waste management and recycling with bins and signage.

We continue to strive to reduce energy consumption at our HMH Warehouses and related offices through: 
 
•Conversion to high efficiency fluorescent bulbs 
 •Conference rooms with motion sensor lighting
 •Energy-efficient HVAC and Heating Units
 •LED light fixtures in parking lots
 
In addition, the building that houses HMH’s Boston Headquarters at 125 High Street has received the LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold Certification for Existing Buildings™, which is the second highest LEED Certification level attainable.  
 
Further, HMH is listed in Forbes’ “Work from Home 2019: The Top 100 Companies for Remote Jobs” due to our remote location positions across the company that contribute to the reduction in facility energy use and employee transportation fuel consumption.
 
Human Rights & Conduct
 
Our values guide every aspect of our work. We believe that respecting and protecting human rights is fundamental to our work as a responsible company. We align with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights laws and standards and strive to embody these values in our culture. We seek to embed respect for human rights across our business and with vendors and suppliers with whom we do business as set forth in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
At HMH, we believe in social justice. The critical work to improve diversity, equity and inclusion is an inward and outward process—we are constantly seeking new ways to better our own culture as we strive to better our world. We aim to create and cultivate an employee community, company culture and business strategy that reflects the diverse demographics and perspectives of our customers. Further, we embrace the diversity of our employees, customers and stakeholders, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, thoughts and talents. We strive to cultivate a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level.  We take direct actions to nurture an inclusive workplace.
 
In 2020, we established a DEI Council made up of a cross-functional, diverse group of employees. The DEI Council supports our company-wide DEI efforts and takes actionable steps toward reaching our DEI goals. The council supports HMH’s Employee Resource Groups, DEI trainings, and discussions on how to build HMH as a model antiracist community. In 2020, we also named a Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to guide our DEI work, engaging critical stakeholders company-wide in our DEI goals and areas of focus. Last year, we provided opportunities for education and growth, including formal and informal opportunities for meaningful conversations — namely, antiracism roundtable discussions and company-wide unconscious bias training for managers.
 
As a learning technology company focused on empowering students and teachers, it is our responsibility to build content and provide services and resources that foster a holistic understanding of our world and honor the diverse communities we serve. As an organization, we too are always learning and growing, and we will continue to be intentional about improvements we make as part of our continuous evolution. To that end, we established a Content Review Panel – a cross-disciplinary internal advisory board that focuses on equity, inclusion, and diversity in our solutions. The panel reviews our content, striving for equitable, nonbiased, and sensitive treatment and representation for all individuals, communities, and experiences across all HMH programs, services, and platforms. In 2020, the Content Review Panel reviewed over 4,000 pages of content, including a full, proactive review of Math180 and Confronting Racism curriculum.

As outlined in our Content, Equity, Inclusion and Diversity pledge available on our website at https://www.hmhco.com/diversity-equity-inclusion/our-world, we are committed to producing curriculum in which all students can see themselves and the possibilities for their future success. Our programs are strongest when they resonate with learners, inspire connections and spark dialogue, and honor the unique qualities and experiences of every learner. 
 
In 2020, a cross-functional Supplier Diversity Council was formed to drive HMH’s Supplier Diversity Program forward. The council is focused on fostering meaningful partnerships with diverse suppliers in all areas of HMH’s business – aiming to establish new partnerships with small and diverse suppliers while also deepening relationships with diverse suppliers that HMH already works with. As part of our commitment to supplier diversity, HMH is a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council.
 
COVID-19 Safety Initiatives
 
At HMH, employee safety and welfare is one of our highest priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has required additional healthy and safety measures be implemented company-wide. Upon daily arrival at our Distribution Centers, all employees, vendors and visitors are screened by medical personnel for COVID-19 symptoms or exposures.  HMH staff and visitors wear masks to help prevent community spread. Breaks and lunches are staggered to maintain CDC-guided social distancing. Workstations are sanitized daily and shared equipment is sanitized after each use. In the event an employee is sick or under quarantine with COVID-19, they will receive full COVID-pay.  If an employee has been in a facility and has tested positive for COVID-19, the entire facility is closed for 24-48 hours and is sanitized before anyone can return.
