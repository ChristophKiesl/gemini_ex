Item 1. Business. 
Overview
When used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" refer to Spark Networks SE and its subsidiaries. 
We are a leader in social dating platforms for meaningful relationships focusing on the 40+ demographic and faith-based affiliations. Since our inception, we have had 112 million users register with our dating platforms (which includes inactive accounts). We currently operate a portfolio of brands accessible to customers across the globe. However, our focus is in five key geographies – the United States of America ("U.S."), Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom ("UK") and France – from which we generate the majority of our revenues.
Our vision is to be the world’s leader in social dating for meaningful relationships. It encompasses the following pillars:
•We build world’s best dating communities focused on the 40+ age demographic and religious communities: our users are active, committed and sophisticated.
•We excel in customer safety, privacy and social dating features.
•We create engaging brands and innovative products to help our customers find true love seamlessly.
We offer services both via websites and mobile applications accessed mostly through a “subscription” business model, where certain basic functionalities are provided free of charge, while providing premium features (such as interacting with other community members via messages) only to paying subscribers.
Subscription revenue is our primary source of income, with membership subscriptions accounting for the vast majority of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Subscription length ranges from one-month to 12-months, with most subscriptions renewing automatically unless the member opts to terminate the subscription. We also offer users "pay as you go" features and have a small but growing advertising revenue stream.
The majority of our users' activity is on mobile devices. We have created innovative and tailored mobile applications and plan to continue to improve the features, functionality and engagement of our mobile websites and applications.
Our American Depository Shares ("ADS") are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market ("Nasdaq").
Our Industry
Our primary businesses are in the online personals industry, which fulfills the needs of single adults looking to meet a companion. Traditional methods such as offline dating services and public gathering places often do not meet the needs of single people. Offline dating services are time-consuming, expensive and offer a smaller number of potential partners. Public gathering places such as restaurants, bars and other social venues provide a limited opportunity to learn about others prior to a one-on-one meeting. In contrast, online personals services facilitate interaction between singles by allowing them to screen and communicate with a large number of potential companions before they meet in-person. With features such as detailed personal profiles, email, mobile chat and instant messaging, this medium allows users to communicate with other singles at their convenience and affords them the ability to meet multiple people in an anonymous, convenient and secure setting.
The global online personals industry has experienced significant growth in recent years. North America is currently the largest geographic market in the online personals industry, according to industry research. Industry research estimates that the dating services industry revenue in the U.S. is expected to increase an annualized 1.0% totaling $4.4 billion by 2027. In recent years, we have increased our market share in the United States through the launch of EliteSingles and SilverSingles in conjunction with the 2017 and 2019 acquisitions of the largely North American brands Jdate, Christian Mingle, JSwipe, and Zoosk.
Our Competitive Strengths
Portfolio of strong brands.
We own a portfolio consisting of some of the most well-known and highest quality dating brands. Our brands are primarily tailored to quality dating with real users looking for love and companionship in a safe, comfortable environment. With shared values being one of the most important factors in successful, long-term relationships, our portfolio holds some of the most established and well-respected value-based dating brands in the world. 
The following is a list of our key brands:
Zoosk, EliteSingles, SilverSingles, Christian Mingle, Jdate and JSwipe 
Diverse global platform.
We operate a diverse global platform of premium online dating sites and mobile applications. This diversified suite of dating sites and mobile applications allows us to implement best practices from each of the brands across our geographic footprint helps us to enable rapid and effective roll-out of new brands and products.
Operational and financial scale.
We are one of the largest online dating companies in the U.S. based on revenue. This allows for the operational and financial scale required for significant investments into new technologies and products, while also providing a better platform to attract and retain customers. Importantly, our marketing strength allows us to acquire a big enough pool of local customers at a national level to provide significant choice in potential partners. 
Low-cost operating base in Berlin, Germany.
We have assembled highly skilled teams with deep domain expertise across marketing, technology, and product within our headquarters in Berlin, Germany. Today, Berlin has a lower cost of living, and in turn, lower salaries than other major cities in Europe or North America. As a result, we require less capital to recruit and retain key employees. This cost advantage has allowed us to allocate significant capital to growth investments like direct marketing while also maintaining and scaling profitably.
Our Strategy
Grow in North America.
We continue to focus on expanding our presence in North America. In recent years, we have grown our North American market share through the (i) introduction of established European brands such as EliteSingles, (ii) launch of new brands such as SilverSingles, and (iii) acquisition of established North American brands such as Zoosk, Jdate, Christian Mingle and JSwipe. 
We expect to continue to allocate significant marketing capital towards North America as we look to drive both the organic growth of our existing brand portfolio and expansion through the launch of new or acquired brands.
Cement and grow our leadership position in 40+ age demographic and religious dating segments.
We will continue to invest in product innovation, brand building, customer acquisition and partnerships to provide the best products and strongest brands in the premium and community-based dating areas. We intend to develop solutions and strengthen our brands that speak to the specific needs of our target audiences. In 2022, we developed updated versions of the EliteSingles app on iOS and Android, and we expect a launch in all markets by early third quarter of 2023. In addition, in 2022, we began to revamp our marketing approach for all our products with the aim of taking advantage of more effective and efficient modes of brand and performance marketing, such as TikTok and Instagram.
Create global technology services to enable flexible and powerful dating platforms.
We are developing new, scalable technology services that we believe will support future growth. We are designing and building our new services with a particular emphasis on supporting all platforms and applications that many of our members utilize to access our products. With shared services to power our platforms, we believe we can reduce the time and resources required to launch new brands or to integrate potential acquisitions, and more quickly adopt new features to trends and consumer preferences.
Markets and Geographical Presence of Spark Networks
We plan to continue to focus on premium online dating services catering to the 40+ demographic and faith-based affiliations. Our strategy includes a focus on developing new and maintaining existing products.
We currently operate a portfolio of brands accessible to customers across the globe. While we might enter new geographies in the future, our primary focus remains expanding our presence in North America, which we consider the most attractive market for further growth based on the relative size of the U.S. and Canadian markets and the potential for us to garner additional market share. We will also consider launching existing brands in markets where we already have a geographic presence to complement our service offerings and create a broader offering in these markets.
Industry research indicates that market demand is expected to have continued growth over the next five years as internet penetration continues to rise and continued trends towards destigmatizing online dating. 
Sales and Marketing
We engage in a variety of marketing activities intended to drive consumer traffic to our websites and mobile applications and allow us the opportunity to introduce our products and services to prospective visitors, members and subscribers. Our marketing efforts are focused online and offline. Our online marketing approach employs a combination of search engine marketing, social media marketing and direct e-mail campaigns to attract potential members and paying subscribers, and use a network of online affiliates, through which we acquire traffic.
We supplement our online marketing by employing a variety of offline marketing. These include television, radio and podcasting. We believe a more consistent, targeted marketing message, delivered through an array of available marketing channels, will improve consumer awareness of our brands, drive more traffic to our products, and therefore increase the number of active users and paying subscribers.
Customer Service
Our customer support services aim to ensure an enjoyable, smooth and safe journey for all of our users. Our multi-lingual support teams provide comprehensive support for our users, which includes assisting members with billing questions, helping members complete personal profiles and answering technical questions. Customer support is also engaged in monitoring our products for fraudulent activity. Certain of our customer support services are provided by our third-party commercial partners, and all customer service personnel receive ongoing training in an effort to better personalize the experience for members and paying subscribers who contact us and to capitalize on upselling opportunities.
Technology
Our product teams are focused on the development and maintenance of products. They work in close cooperation with the technical teams, who build and manage our software and hardware infrastructure. We intend to continue investing in the development of new products, such as mobile applications, and enhancing the efficiency and functionality of our existing products and infrastructure.
Our network infrastructure and operations are designed to deliver high levels of availability, performance, security and scalability in a cost-effective manner.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties.
Spark Networks, Spark, Zoosk, Jdate, Christian Mingle, SilverSingles and EliteSingles, amongst others, are registered trademarks in the U.S. Spark Networks, Zoosk, Jdate, Christian Mingle, EliteSingles and SilverSingles, amongst others, are registered trademarks in the European Union ("EU"). We also have a number of other registered and unregistered trademarks, and many of our trademarks are also registered in other jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, Iceland and Canada. Our rights to these registered trademarks generally continue as long as we use and renew them periodically. 
We rely on internal and external controls, including applicable laws and regulations and contractual provisions with employees, contractors, customers and others, to protect and control access to our intellectual property rights.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment with minimal barriers to entry. We believe the primary competitive factors in creating a community on the internet are functionality, brand recognition, reputation, critical mass of members, member affinity and loyalty, ease-of-use, quality of service and reliability. We compete with a number of large and small companies. Our principal online personals services competitors include Match Group (which operates the Match.com, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Tinder and Hinge brands), Bumble (which operates the Bumble and Badoo brands) and ParshipMeet Group (which operates the eHarmony, Parship, ElitePartner and Meet brands). In addition, we face competition in free and freemium mobile applications such as Tinder, Hinge and Bumble, as well as social networking sites such as Facebook.
Government Regulation
Our business is regulated by diverse and evolving laws and governmental authorities in the European Union, North America and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject to laws and regulations related to internet communications, privacy, consumer protection, security and data protection, intellectual property rights, commerce, taxation, entertainment, recruiting and advertising. These laws and regulations are becoming more prevalent, and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the European Union, individual EU Member States, the U.S. Congress, U.S. state legislatures and other governments. Failure by us to comply with existing laws and regulations may subject us to liabilities. New laws and regulations governing such matters could be enacted or amendments may be made to existing regulations at any time that could adversely impact our services. Plus, legal uncertainties surrounding domestic and foreign government regulations could increase our costs of doing business, require us to revise our services, prevent us from delivering our services over the internet or slow the growth of the internet, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the risks and related matters, see e.g. “Risk Factors." The varying and rapidly evolving regulatory framework on privacy and data protection across jurisdictions could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.”
Human Capital Disclosure
As a human-capital intensive business, we believe the long-term success of our firm depends on our people. We are not only striving for communities and relationships that last for our users but also for our workforce by establishing a supportive and empowering culture. Our goal is to ensure that we have the right talent in the right place at the right time.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 271 employees based in Germany and the U.S.
We monitor and evaluate various turnover and attrition metrics. We believe our annualized turnover among our high performing personnel is healthy for our industry, which we attribute to our strong values-based culture, commitment to career development, attractive compensation and benefit programs, and an inclusive, diverse and safe work environment. 
Value Based Culture
We strive to attract individuals who are people-focused and share our core values. We promote recognition of behavior, initiatives, and projects which model our values across the organization. We continue to intensely focus on creating a highly engaged workforce, driving improvements across our communications, our culture, our reward programs, and our work environment and fostering a collaborative, inclusive and inspiring experience for all of our employees. These efforts are reflected in a strong commitment across our workforce. The results of our Year End 2022 Annual Employee Survey, which was completed by 79% of our workforce, revealed that more than 84% of our employees are satisfied with their employment and 86% are motivated to achieve our goals. 91% of our employees confirmed that we offer a supportive work environment. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Commitment to Career Development
We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers, through a multitude of training and development programs. We offer our employees several tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, and in-house learning opportunities, including Spark Academy (our in-house education program offering online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats). In addition, we invest in our executive talent through succession planning and individualized development planning.
Attractive Compensation and Benefit program
We are committed to providing a total compensation package to our employees that is market-competitive and performance based, with the goal of driving innovation and operational excellence. One of our primary objectives with respect to employee compensation is to attract and retain the best possible employee talent, to link annual compensation and long-term stock-based compensation to achievement of measurable corporate goals and individual performance, and to align employee’ incentives with stockholder value creation. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Our employees reflect the communities in which we live and work. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 51% of our overall workforce are women. Our six person Board consists of three female directors, and one of the members of our Board is African American. Our Board, CEO and senior executives model high standards of diversity, equity and inclusion. We believe that that the diversity of our management and workforce is key to our success.
Healthy Work Environment
During 2022, we continued to focus significant attention on the effective handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our response has included a reorganization of our office plans to ensure compliance with social distancing and hygiene requirements and a safe work environment. We made additional investments in company-wide engagement events to ensure connectivity and collaboration across the organization and implemented the use of flexible and remote work arrangements and other creative solutions. We also modified training programs to comply with distancing requirements, limited visitor entry, increased virtual meetings, and provided additional support through mental and behavioral health resources. We also developed resources to support employees and their families with additional time off, flexible schedules and employer paid benefits.
