Item 1. Business.
General
 
Discovery Energy Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on May 24, 2006 under the name “Santos Resource Corp”. The current business of the Company is the exploration and development of the 584,651 gross acres (914 sq. miles) area in South Australia (“Prospect”) held under Petroleum Exploration License PEL 512 (“License”). The Prospect is located in the “Western Flank” area, which is the southwest Permian edge of the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, the most prolific producing onshore region in Australia. There are three separate acreage blocks in the Prospect: West (~400,000 acres), South (~181,000 acres) and Lycium (~4,000 acres). In May 2012, the Company incorporated a wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Discovery Energy SA Ltd. (“Subsidiary”), for the purpose of acquiring a 100% working interest in the License. In May 2016, the Subsidiary’s legal entity status changed from public to private and its name changed to Discovery Energy SA Pty Ltd. The Company is in the initial exploration phase of determining whether or not the Prospect contains economically recoverable volumes of crude oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids (collectively “Hydrocarbons”). Although the Company’s current focus is primarily on the Prospect, management from time-to-time exchanges information with other industry participants regarding additional investment opportunities in Australia. The Company’s internet address is https://discoveryenergy.com.

Recent Developments and Events
 
This section discusses developments and events during fiscal 2021 that are believed to be significant to the Company.
 
Extension of Debentures. On May 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an initial investor (the “Original Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Company issued to the Original Purchaser some of the Company’s Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (each a “Debenture” and collectively the “Debentures”). The Debentures are debt instruments convertible into the Company’s common shares. Eventually a second investor was made a party to the Securities Purchase Agreement and was also issued Debentures. Thus far, the Company has issued to these two investors a total of 14 Debentures having an aggregate original principal amount of $6,850,000. Interest on the Debentures to date has been accrued and added to principal, thereby increasing the outstanding balance on the Debentures to approximately $9,699,000 as of March 31, 2021. Interest will continue to be accrued until such time as the Debentures are repaid or converted to common shares. The original terms of the Debentures provided that the principal amount of and accrued interest on the Debentures was due and payable in a single balloon payment on or before May 27, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”). For more information about the Debentures, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing History and Immediate, Short-Term Capital Needs - Debentures Financing” below.

In conjunction with certain issuances of the Debentures, warrants (“Warrants”) were issued to the Original Purchaser that grant to it the right to purchase up to an aggregate maximum number of 19,125,000 common shares at an initial per-share exercise price of $0.20. The Warrants have been amended from time to time to extend their expiration dates (the “Termination Date”). Prior to the extension discussed below, the Warrants had a Termination Date of February 28, 2021. For more information about the Warrants, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing History and Immediate, Short-Term Capital Needs - Debentures Financing” below.
 
On February 4, 2021, the parties to the Debentures and Warrants entered into an amendment to them providing for the following:
 

* | The Maturity Date of the Debentures was extended to December 31, 2023. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | The Termination Date of the Warrants was also extended to December 31, 2023. 
* | The Company agreed to issue to the Original Purchaser additional Warrants to purchase 8,752,058 additional common shares at a per-share exercise price of $0.20, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain customary events. These warrants were issued on May 28, 2021, and have an expiration date of December 31, 2023. These warrants bring the total number of warrant shares that may be acquired by the Original Purchaser to 27,877,058. 

 
Management believes that the extension of the Debentures under favorable terms, and the recent extension of the deadlines for the work commitment on the Prospect have mitigated many of the issues and concerns affecting the Company caused by the effects of Covid-19 in the U.S. and Australia.
 
Suspension of Work Commitment. On August 13, 2020, the Company received from the Government of South Australia, Department of Energy and Mining, confirmation that such agency had approved the Company’s application for an additional 12-month suspension of the work commitment relating to the License. Prior to this further suspension, the Company’s remaining work commitments were due to be completed by October 29, 2022. The deadlines for the Company’s remaining work commitments are detailed in the section captioned “Item 1. Business - Plan of Operation - Current Primary Activity” below.
 
Paycheck Protection Program Loan. In connection with the Paycheck Protection Program established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Company borrowed an initial loan during fiscal year 2021 in the amount of $118,750 and a second loan during fiscal year 2022 in the amount of $120,000. The Company is in the process of applying for the forgiveness of the first draw to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. The Company is also planning on applying for forgiveness of the second draw to the maximum extent permitted.
 
On-going Effects of Coronavirus Pandemic. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”), surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 spread to many countries, including the U.S. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, travel restrictions and other public health safety measures. It resulted in a significant spike in unemployment and a concomitant decline in economic activity in the U.S., Australia and many other countries, and any future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments may have similar effects. Although the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been lessening in the U.S. and other parts of the world overall due to (among other things) effective vaccination programs, these effects could start worsening again in the U.S. and elsewhere, creating renewed uncertainty. The current COVID-19 pandemic could continue to, and future similar epidemics or pandemics could also, materially and adversely impact our ability to finance and conduct our business once it becomes operational, and could materially and adversely impact our operations, financial condition and results. See the risk factor captioned “PANDEMICS OR DISEASE OUTBREAKS (SUCH AS THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, ALSO KNOWN AS THE COVID-19 VIRUS) COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VAREITY OF WAYS.”

Recovery in Hydrocarbons Prices. Almost simultaneously with the initial widespread adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, a Hydrocarbons price war began in early March 2020. At the time that this event started on March 8, 2020, the price of Brent crude was $45.27 per barrel, which was already down from a recent high of $68.91 on January 6, 2020. Such price declined to a low of $19.33 on April 21, 2020. By June 2021, the posted price of Brent had recovered to almost $73 per barrel. Hydrocarbons are volatile and entail certain risks. See the risk factor captioned “HYDROCARBONS ARE COMMODITIES SUBJECT TO PRICE VOLATILITY BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF PRODUCERS, AND LOW PRICES MAY MAKE PROPERTIES UNECONOMIC.” The Company has no assurance that the price of Hydrocarbons will remain at adequate levels or that the Company will not be harmed by future prolonged low Hydrocarbon prices.
 
Historical Milestones
 
To date, the Company has achieved the following milestones:
 

* | On October 26, 2012, the License was granted to the Subsidiary. After the License grant, the Company’s primary focus was on completing a financing to raise sufficient funds so that the Company could undertake a required proprietary seismic acquisition program. After exploring a number of possible financings, the precipitous decline in crude oil prices starting in the summer of 2014 delayed the Company’s ability to successfully complete a financing of the type being sought. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | The Company completed the Debentures and Warrant financing described in “Item 1. Business - Recent Developments and Events - Extension of Debentures” above. Among other uses, the proceeds from the Debentures enabled the Company to undertake required seismic work. For more information about the Debentures and the Warrants, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing History and Immediate, Short-Term Capital Needs - Debentures Financing” below. 
* | On October 30, 2016, fieldwork was completed on the Company’s proprietary Nike 3D seismic survey (the “Nike Survey”) covering an approximately 69 sq. mile (179 sq. km.) section of the western portion of the South Block of the Prospect and directly on trend and in close proximity to mature producing oilfields and recent discoveries on the blocks to the north. The Nike Survey was completed at a “turnkey price” of approximately $2.4 million. 
* | The raw data from the Nike Survey was converted to analytical quality information, processed and interpreted by the Company’s geophysical advisor. Interpretation of the processed data included advanced technical analysis by specialized consultants. This technical work identified an inventory of more than 30 leads judged to be potential areas of crude oil accumulations. The Company has prioritized these initial prospective locations for presentation to potential sources of significant capital. Technical analysis is on-going. 
* | In June 2017, the Company completed the archeological and environmental field surveys of seven prospective drilling locations as required by applicable laws and regulations. It subsequently filed reports on these surveys with the South Australian government; no material issues were identified at any of the prospective drilling sites. 
* | In addition to the amounts raised pursuant to the Debentures arrangements, since the Company adopted its current business plan, the Company has raised funds totaling approximately $4.6 million through private placements of the Company’s common shares. 
* | In several transactions to date, the Company (through the Subsidiary) purchased portions of an original 7.0% royalty interest relating to the Prospect retained by the party that, in effect, transferred and sold the License to the Company. As a result, the Company (through the Subsidiary) now owns an aggregate 5.0% royalty interest, while the previous holder of the original 7.0% royalty interest continues to hold a 2.0% royalty interest. The aggregate purchase price for the aggregate 5.0% royalty interest was $540,500 USD.

Prospect
 
There are producing wells on trend and directly north and east of the Company’s South block. A typical Namur well, a primary producing reservoir in the Western Flank, is drilled to a depth of approximately 5,500 feet. The wellbore is vertical or near vertical and there is no lateral drilling or hydraulic stimulation required. This high-permeability reservoir combined with a strong aquifer system produces high flow and recovery rates. Initial production rates typically range from 450 to 940 barrels of oil per day (“BOPD”). Production is anticipated to be sweet, high gravity (45 degree) crude which is expected to result in premium pricing. As described in the section captioned “Markets and Marketing” below, markets for the Company’s future production are readily accessible via existing infrastructure.
 
Beginning in 2018, Beach Energy began implementing horizontal drilling techniques targeting the lower permeability McKinlay and Birkhead reservoirs in the Western Flank. Several wells, with lateral sections of approximately 2,000 feet, were successfully drilled and completed. Initial production rates ranged from 800 to 2,000 BOPD resulting in an average well productivity improvement of 8.2 times over vertical wells for 1.5 times the cost. Typically, the time and cost to drill a well decreases and production rates and economics improve as additional wells are drilled and the increase in knowledge and experience is incorporated into best practices.
 
Exploration Activity
 
Since 2012, the Company has assembled a database that now includes a substantial inventory of data, analyses and technical information on the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, fields in the Western Flank, operators and operations, all in close proximity to the Prospect. In 2012, an engineering consultant was engaged to prepare an NI 51-101 compliant report which resulted in the identification of more than 110 seismic generated leads over approximately 30% of the Prospect. This was complimented by the reinterpretation of approximately 3,200 miles (5,153 km.) of 2D seismic data and the reprocessing and reinterpretation of approximately 55 sq. miles (141 sq. km.) of 3D seismic data from a survey conducted over the Lake Hope area in the eastern portion of the South block. The data described in the preceding sentence was acquired in connection with the issuance of the License. In late 2016, the Company conducted the approximately $2.4 million Nike Survey covering an area of approximately 69 sq. miles (179 sq. km.) located in the western section of the South block and directly on trend and in close proximity to mature producing oil fields and recent discoveries on blocks to the north. The Company has also undertaken some “work area clearance” (“WAC”) surveys.
 
Terms of the License
 
In 2012, the Subsidiary received a formal grant of the License from the South Australian Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy. The License is a “Petroleum Exploration License” (a “PEL”) granting the right to explore for all regulated resources (including petroleum and any other substance that naturally occurs in association with petroleum) relating to the Prospect, provided, however, that the License does not permit use of the Prospect as a source of geothermal energy or a natural reservoir for the purpose of gas storage.
 
The Company now holds a 100% working interest in the License, subject to a 10% overriding royalty interest in favor of the State of South Australia and an aggregate 3% overriding royalty interests in favor of others. In view of these overriding royalty interests, the Company’s net revenue interest in the License is 87%
 
The License is subject to a five-year work commitment as described below. Failure to comply with the work program requirements could lead to the cancellation of the License. The License also requires that insurance of the types and amounts of coverage that management believes are reasonable, customary and the industry standard be maintained, and contains provisions regarding environmental matters and liabilities that management also believes are reasonable, customary and the industry standard.
 
The initial term of the License is five years, with two five-year renewal terms, subject to the provisions of the South Australian Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000. As discussed herein, the initial five-year term has been suspended a number of times; as a result, this initial term currently remains in effect. At the end of the initial five-year term of the License and assuming that the Company has met its obligations, the License can be renewed for a first five-year renewal term, provided, however, that the Company must relinquish one-third of its acreage or convert all or portions of it to a Petroleum Retention License (a “PRL”). At the end of the first five-year renewal term, assuming that the Company has met its commitment obligations, the License can be renewed for a second five-year renewal term, provided, however, that the Company must relinquish one-third of its original acreage or convert all or portions of the remaining acreage to a PRL. Relevant law requires the South Australian government to grant a PEL with respect to any acreage to be relinquished if the related licensee submits a reasonable application for renewal of the related license. Management believes that (as a matter of practice) the South Australian government almost invariably grants renewals, although the Company has no assurance that this will occur in its case. Any renewal could entail additional requirements, such as additional work commitments. Control over acreage can remain in effect indefinitely, so long as the licensee converts its license to a Petroleum Production License” (a “PPL”) and is producing Hydrocarbons from the related acreage. A PPL has requirements somewhat different from a PEL, and the scope of the acreage in effect “held by production” is limited by applicable law.
 
Plan of Operation
 
Current Status
 
The Company is in the initial phase of its Plan of Operation. To date, field operations have been limited to the successful completion of seismic and related WAC surveys. Without drilling results, the Company does not have the necessary technical data to prepare estimates of Hydrocarbon reserves needed to prepare various reports for submission to regulators. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will find commercially producible volumes of Hydrocarbons.

Current Primary Activities
 
The Company’s current primary activity is to complete either a major financing or a major joint venture relationship, or both, so that it can execute the remaining work commitment described below, and develop the Prospect.
 
The License is subject to a five-year work commitment, which imposes certain financial obligations on the Company. In management’s view, the geotechnical work completed in Years 1 and 2 of the commitment was sufficient to satisfy the License requirements for those two years. Required reports in connection with these activities were timely filed. To date, no comments from the government have been received, and management understands that the relevant government agency is required by law to furnish comments within 30 days after the reports are filed. Moreover, such agency has extended and modified the work commitment a number of times since the filing of the reports, and has been very accommodating with Company requests.
 
Over the term of the License thus far, a number of extensions and modifications of the work commitment have been granted. The current remaining work commitment is as follows:
 

* | Year 3 ending October 28, 2021 - Shoot 2D seismic data totaling at least approximately 62 miles (100 km.) and shoot 3D seismic data totaling at a minimum approximately 77 sq. miles (200 sq. km.) and drill two wells. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | Year 4 ending October 29, 2022 - Shoot 3D seismic data totaling a minimum of approximately 77 sq. miles (200 sq. km.) and drill two wells. 
* | Year 5 ending October 29, 2023 - Drill three wells. 

 
The Company needs a significant amount of additional capital to fulfill its obligations under the work commitment. Moreover, the Debentures will mature in December 2023, and the Company will need to raise additional funds or generate sufficient revenues through Hydrocarbon production to timely repay the Debentures, if they are not converted. The Company’s capital requirements and financing activities are described in the section captioned “Liquidity and Capital Requirements” below. The success of the initial phase of the Plan of Operation depends upon the Company’s ability to obtain additional capital or enter into a suitable joint venture arrangement in order to acquire additional seismic data and successfully drill commitment wells. Failure to obtain required additional capital or enter into a suitable joint venture arrangement will materially and adversely affect the Company and its stockholders in ways that are discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Consequences of a Financing Failure” below. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will obtain the necessary capital and/or enter into a suitable joint venture agreement.
 
Once the Company is in a position to commence drilling, it intends to engage the services of a third-party contractor. No significant impediments to procuring the services of one or more qualified contract operators and drillers in connection with the initial phase of the Company’s Plan of Operation are anticipated. However, a considerable increase in drilling activity in the West Flank area could result in longer wait times and higher costs to obtain materials and services. The contract operator will be responsible for all regulatory compliance matters; hiring the drilling contractor, geologist and petroleum engineer to make final decisions relative to the zones to be targeted; well design; drilling and logging. Should wells comprising the Company’s drilling operations be successful, the operator will then be responsible for completion operations, production facilities procurement, installation, operations and maintenance, interconnecting with gathering or transmission pipelines and attending to various administrative matters.
 
The Company initially plans to focus on oil-bearing formations, and thus crude oil is most likely to be the Company’s principal product for the foreseeable future, if the Company is successful in its exploration and production activities. Natural gas is not expected to be a significant opportunity for the foreseeable future. The Company expects that most of its oil production will be transported through trucking operations owned by others.

-


Any natural gas produced may (depending on the amount produced) be flared or transported through gathering systems and gas pipelines that are owned by others. Transportation capacity on gas gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to the facilities or due to use by other gas shippers with priority transportation agreements or who own or control the relevant pipeline. The Company cannot accurately predict the costs of transporting its natural gas production until it drills, completes and tests its initial successful wells. The cost of installing infrastructure to deliver the Company’s natural gas production to Moomba, which, as described below, is the principal transportation center for the area, or elsewhere will vary depending upon distance traversed, negotiated handling/treating fees, pipeline tariffs and other associated costs. Although issues pertaining to the Company’s natural gas transportation could adversely affect the Company, the Company does not believe that this will be the case due to the minor role that any natural gas production is expected to play in the Company’s business.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
The petroleum industry has been characterized historically by Hydrocarbon prices that fluctuate (sometimes dramatically), and supplier costs can rise significantly during industry booms. The most recent price decline cycle started in early March 2020 when an oil price war began. On March 8, 2020, the price of Brent crude was $45.27 per barrel, which was already down from a recent high of $68.91 on January 6, 2020. Such price declined to a low of $19.33 on April 21, 2020. By March 2021, the posted price of Brent had recovered to almost $70 per barrel. The Company has no assurance that the price of Hydrocarbons will recover to adequate levels or that the Company will not be harmed by prolonged low levels of Hydrocarbon prices. Hydrocarbon prices and markets are likely to remain volatile. Sales prices for these commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include:

* | international political conditions (including embargoes, wars and civil unrest, such as the recent unrest in the Middle East); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | the domestic and foreign supply of Hydrocarbons; 
* | consumer demand; 
* | weather conditions; 
* | domestic and foreign governmental regulations and other actions; 
* | actions taken by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”); 
* | technological advances affecting energy consumption; 
* | technology and knowledge advances’ impact seismic, drilling, development and production; 
* | the price and availability of alternative fuels; 
* | epidemics, pandemics and government action that impedes the ability of companies to undertake their businesses; and 
* | general economic conditions. 

 
Decreases in Hydrocarbon prices might not only decrease the Company’s future revenues on a per unit basis, but could also reduce the volumes that the Company could produce economically. A sustained decline in sales prices could materially and adversely affect the Company’s future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and borrowing capacity, and may require a reduction in the carrying value of the Company’s assets. While the Company’s future revenues may increase if prevailing prices increase significantly, exploration and production costs and acquisition costs for additional properties and reserves could also increase. The Company might enter into hedging arrangements or use derivative financial instruments to hedge in whole or in part the risk associated with fluctuations in Hydrocarbon prices.
 
The Company does not expect to refine any of its production, although it may need to treat or process some of its production to meet the quality standards of purchasing or transportation companies. Therefore, the Company expects that all or nearly all of its production will be sold to a relatively small number of customers. Production from the Company’s properties will be marketed in a manner consistent with industry practices. The Company does not currently have any long-term sales contracts for its future production, but it expects that it will generally sell any production that it develops pursuant to these types of contracts. The Company does not believe that it will have any difficulty in entering into long-term sales contracts for its production, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
 
The principal Hydrocarbon transportation hub for the Western Flank is located in the vicinity of Moomba. This processing and transportation center is approximately 37 miles due east of the Prospect’s easternmost boundary and about 40 miles from the Company’s expected initial drill sites. These sites are located about 20 miles from a privately-owned terminal for trucking oil in Lycium. The Lycium Hub is also the terminal point for a main Trunk Line with a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day, which delivers oil to the Moomba Processing Facility. Management believes that the Company has access to an infrastructure sufficient to transports its Hydrocarbon production to processing facilities or customer markets.

-


The availability of a ready market for the Company’s production will depend on a number of factors beyond the Company’s control, including the availability of other production in the Prospect’s vicinity, the proximity and capacity of Hydrocarbon pipelines, and fluctuations in supply and demand. Although the effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated, the Company does not anticipate any unusual difficulty in contracting to sell its production of Hydrocarbons to purchasers at prevailing market prices and under arrangements that are usual and customary in the industry. However, there can be no assurance that market, economic and regulatory factors will not in the future materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell its production.
 
Sales prices for Hydrocarbon production are negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as the reported trading prices for Hydrocarbons on local or international commodity exchanges, distance from wells to pipelines, well pressure, estimated reserves, commodity quality and prevailing supply conditions. Historically, Hydrocarbon sales prices have experienced high volatility resulting from changing perceptions throughout the industry centered on supply and demand. The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect sales prices or the degree to which such prices will be affected. However, sales prices realized by the Company should be equivalent to the then current market prices in the geographic region of the Prospect. Typically, crude oil prices in Australia reflect or are “benchmarked” against European commodity market trading settlement prices, mainly Brent Crude.
 
The Company will strive to obtain the best sales prices in the area of its production. The Company’s revenues, profitability and future growth will depend substantially on prevailing prices. Decreases in the sales prices would likely adversely affect the carrying value of any proved reserves the Company is successful in establishing and its prospects, revenues, profitability and cash flow.
 
Competition
 
The Company expects to operate in the highly competitive industry of Hydrocarbon exploration, development and production. The Company believes that the level of competition in these areas will continue and may even intensify. In the areas of Hydrocarbon exploration, development and production, competitive advantage is gained through superior capital investment decisions, technological innovation and cost management. The Company’s competitors include major firms and a large number of independent companies. Because the Company expects to have control over acreage sufficient for its exploration and production efforts for the foreseeable future, the Company does not expect to compete for the acquisitions of properties for the exploration for Hydrocarbons. However, the Company will compete for the equipment, services and labor required to explore for, develop and produce its properties and to transport its production. Many of the Company’s competitors have substantially larger operating staffs and greater financial and other resources. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than the Company can, which would adversely affect its competitive position. Moreover, most of the Company’s competitors have been operating in the Western Flank for longer periods than the Company has and they have demonstrated the ability to operate through a number of industry cycles. The impact of this intense competition cannot currently be determined.
Regulation
 
The Company’s operations in South Australia and within the Western Flank are subject to the laws and regulations of the State of South Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia. The License was granted under the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 (SA) and the Company’s operations within and with respect to the License are governed by this Act and by the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Regulations 2013 (SA). This legislation covers all phases of the Company’s operations including exploration, appraisal, development and production of Hydrocarbons from the License area. Other legislation which the Company will be required to comply with at various stages of its operations include: Environment Protection Act 1993 (SA); Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988 (SA); Native Title Act 1994 (SA) and Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). As its Hydrocarbon exploration and production operations in South Australia proceed, the Company will provide more detailed information regarding the material features and effects of these laws and regulations and such other legislation with which the Company will be required to comply.

Employees
 
As of the date of this Report, the Company had three full-time employees. Fiscal 2021 was the first time that the Company had employees since it adopted its current business plan. However, the Company has used a number of consultants and part-time service providers in the past, including members of the Company’s current management team. The Company’s needs for additional personnel in the future are uncertain.
