ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We strive to lead the sustainable agriculture movement through the discovery, development, production and promotion of effective, efficient and environmentally responsible biological products for pest management, plant nutrition and plant health. We target the major markets that use conventional chemical pesticides and fertilizers, where our biological products are used as alternatives for, or mixed with, conventional products. We also target new markets for which there are no available conventional chemical products or where the use of conventional chemical products may not be desirable (including for organically certified crops) or permissible either because of health and environmental concerns, or because the development of pest resistance has reduced the efficacy of conventional chemical pesticides.
 
Biological products for pest management (or crop protection) are referred to as biopesticides, or bioprotection products. Biological fertilizers and fertilizer enhancers are referred to as bionutrition products, and biological products for plant health are referred to as biostimulants. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) registers two major categories of biopesticides, including microbial pesticides, which contain a microorganism such as a bacterium or fungus as the active ingredient, and biochemical pesticides, which are naturally occurring substances such as pheromones that disrupt insect mating or plant extracts and fatty acids that inhibit feeding or stop development. Bioprotection products and biostimulants are both comprised of naturally occurring microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, biochemicals, such as humic acid and fulvic acids, and plant extracts, such as seaweed extract. Our product lines for crop protection are all EPA registered biopesticides. Our biostimulant and bionutrition product lines do not require federal registration and are more lightly regulated around the globe than bioprotection products.
 
We sell our products through distributors and other commercial partners to growers who use our bioprotection products to manage pests and plant diseases, our biostimulants to reduce crop stress and both our biostimulants and bionutrition products to increase yields and quality. Out of our Davis, California facilities we have developed and commercialized several patent-protected product lines based on various active ingredients, which we refer to in this Annual Report as our Marrone products, including our Regalia product line (based on the active ingredient knotweed), for controlling plant disease and increasing plant health, our Grandevo and Venerate product lines (based on two new species of bacteria, Chromobacterium subtsugae and Burkholderia rinojensis), each for insect and mite control, our Majestene product line and its turf and ornamentals counterpart brand Zelto (based on the same active ingredient bacterium in Venerate), each for nematode control, and our Stargus product line (based on a new strain of Bacillus nakamurai), for downy mildew and white mold control and increased plant health. In addition, in 2019, we acquired the peroxyacetic acid-based plant health product lines Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide from Jet Harvest Solutions, which we refer to in this Annual Report as our Jet products, and through our 2019 acquisition of Pro Farm Technologies OY (“Pro Farm”), we added to our portfolio bionutrition and biostimulant product lines, which we refer to in this Annual Report as our Pro Farm products, including UBP and Foramin.
 
All our products can be used in both conventional and organic crop production. Historically, our bioprotection products have been primarily sold to growers of specialty crops such as grapes, tree fruit, fruiting and leafy vegetables, nuts, leafy greens, medicinal plant and hemp crops and turf and ornamentals. In recent years, selling seed treatments for row crops has become a strategic focus. In January 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Albaugh, LLC (“Albaugh”), to bundle our Venerate product into a seed treatment platform, which expanded our reach to row crops, including cotton, soybeans, corn and wheat. In addition, we sell our Pro Farm products as a seed treatment for corn, soybeans, sunflower and canola, and are expanding our Pro Farm product platform for seed treatment globally.
 
In addition to our agricultural biological products for crop protection, plant nutrition and plant health, our Marrone products also include Zequanox, a pest management product line that we sell to the water treatment market. Zequanox selectively controls invasive mussels that cause significant infrastructure and ecological damage across a broad range of in-pipe and open-water applications, including hydroelectric and thermoelectric power generation, industrial applications and recreation. We continue to work with power and industrial plants to treat mussel infestations and have also received continued interest from government agencies to use Zequanox to assist in rehabilitating invasive mussel-infested Great Lakes ecosystems, including fishery habitats. As resources have necessitated our focus on our agricultural business, we are working on a strategy that will allow us to better monetize Zequanox and our algaecide water technologies.

We continue to execute on our strategic plan, which focuses our resources on improving and promoting our commercially available products, making accretive acquisitions that can accelerate our growth and revenues, advancing product candidates that are expected to have the greatest impact on near-term growth potential and expanding our international presence and international commercialization of our products. We also continue to focus on finding ways to reduce expenses, conserve cash and improve operating efficiencies, to extract greater value from our products and product pipeline and to improve our support of the global sustainability movement that is core to our cultural values.
 
In connection with this strategy, in the past two years, we have invested in new headcount in sales and marketing, with increased focus on large growers in our top target crops, on-farm demonstrations, trainings and education on our products, while continuing to provide our product development staff with responsibility for technical sales support, field-trials and demonstrations to promote sales growth. Our research and development efforts are concentrated primarily on supporting existing commercial products with a focus on reducing cost of product revenues, further understanding the modes of action, enhancing product potency, supporting commercial manufacturing and improving formulations while also advancing a select list of pipeline products such as our herbicide and enhanced Majestene products under development.
 
Industry Overview
 
Most of the markets we currently target or plan to target primarily rely on conventional chemical pesticides and fertilizers, or, in the cases of corn, soybean, canola and cotton, genetically modified crops. However, the agrichemical industry for crop protection and the fertilizer industry for crop nutrition are facing rapid change due to regulatory actions, consumer concerns and climate change, with slower overall market growth rates worldwide and most conventional agrichemical markets maturing despite more rapid growth in some emerging agricultural markets. Phillips McDougall, an independent advisory firm, estimates the 2019 world agrichemical market at the distributor level at $57.8 billion, increasing only 0.4% from 2018, with Asia Pacific first at $17.2 billion in size, followed by Latin America at $16.7 billion, Europe at $11.3 billion, the NAFTA region at $10.4 billion and the Middle East and Africa at $2.2 billion. All regions declined in growth except Latin America, which grew at 17.6%. Non-crop pesticides such as those used for home, water, pets and animal production also grew modestly, at 3.5% to $7.8 billion. Phillips McDougall also estimates the market for genetically modified crop seeds at $22.0 billion in 2018, a decrease of 1.1% from 2017. According to the Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market was $155.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at 3.8% annually through 2025, with Asia-Pacific accounting for 60% of the global fertilizer market.
 
In contrast to these low or flat growth rates, demand for effective and environmentally responsible agricultural products continues to expand as growers increasingly turn to biological products to enhance their return on investment. The global market for biocontrol (bioprotection) products was valued by Dunham Trimmer, an independent market research firm, at $3.8 billion in 2018, and has projected this market to grow to $10 billion in 2025, reflecting a 16.5% compound annual growth rate over the period. While the biofertizer (bionutrition) market only comprises about $2.0 billion of the global fertilizer market, according to MarketsandMarkets, it is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 11.2% from 2019 through 2025. According to Dunham Trimmer the biostimulant market, which does not have a direct chemical comparison, has a global market value of about $2.5 billion, and is growing at 13% annually as well. We believe our current product portfolio and pipeline of technologies address this global demand, particularly in burgeoning agricultural categories like seed treatment and organic production.
 
Disruptive Biological Technologies
 
Pest Management
 
Growers are constantly challenged to supply the escalating global demand for food, while reducing the potentially negative impact of crop protection and production practices on consumers, farm workers and the environment. The dominant technologies for crop protection are conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified crops. The cost and time to bring one new chemical pesticide to market is estimated to cost over $286.0 million and take an average of 11 years. In addition, major agrichemical companies have invested billions of dollars to develop genetically modified crops that resist pests or have selectively high tolerance to certain conventional chemical pesticides.

Conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified crops have historically been effective in controlling pests. However, there are increasing challenges facing the use of conventional chemical pesticides such as pest resistance and environmental, consumer and worker safety concerns. Governmental agencies are further pressuring growers, distributors and manufacturers, by restricting or banning, certain classes of conventional chemical pesticide usage. In the European Union (“EU”), many conventional chemical pesticide products have been phased out by key agriculture producing nations, such as France. Also, this trend to ban certain chemical pesticides has expanded into local government levels, where many city and county governments have prohibited the use of certain conventional chemical pesticide products, magnifying the complexity of agrichemical companies’ distribution and regulatory compliance. Consumers, scientists and environmental groups have also voiced concerns about the potential unintended effects of genetically modified crops, including pest and weed resistance. Many weed species have developed resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide that is sprayed over soybean, corn and cotton crops genetically engineered to tolerate this chemical. Crops resistant to the herbicide dicamba have been recently developed to partially address expanding resistance of weeds to glyphosate, but they are already are facing resistance from growers and state governments due to damage to neighboring crops from dicamba drift. Corn rootworm, a key pest of corn in the United States, has evolved resistance to most of the engineered traits.
 
In response, an increasing number of growers are implementing integrated pest management (“IPM”) programs that, among other things, combine bio-based pest management products and crop cultivating practices and techniques such as crop rotation, with conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified crops. Bio-based pest management products are becoming a larger component of IPM programs due in part to continued challenges associated with conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified crops. We have focused attention to the benefits of integrated programs, branding programs that use our products together with traditional products in tank mixtures or rotations as BioUniteTM - the power of biology with the performance of chemistry. With field trials and demonstrations in various crops, we have quantified the added economic return to growers of the combined program compared to their chemical-only program, showing a higher yield and quality.
 
Plant Nutrition
 
Crop nutrition products can be based on natural or synthetically made materials. Chemical fertilizers are under scrutiny because their overuse causes run off and pollution of surface and ground waters. For example, nitrate pollution from nitrogen fertilizers and animal wastes in groundwater has created a widespread water quality problem that can pose serious health risks to pregnant women and infants. As such, a number of mandatory and voluntary programs have been developed by the California State Water Resource Control Board and California Regional Water Quality Control Board to address past and future nitrate pollution. Phosphorus is also a common component of mineral and manure fertilizers, but a large portion of phosphorus applied as fertilizer is not taken up by plants and either builds up in the soil or washes into rivers, lakes and coastal seas or seeps into ground water. This has caused dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, algal blooms in the Great Lakes and eutrophication. Also, research is increasingly demonstrating the negative impact that synthetic fertilizers have on soil health and the soil microbiome. The support and promotion of soil health has become a key focus and goal of more sustainable agricultural practices that reduce chemical inputs, help mitigate climate change and increase farm profitability, e.g. regenerative agriculture.
 
On the other hand, bionutrition products can reduce the need for chemical fertilizers by increasing the efficiency of plant uptake of crop nutrients and by providing or generating necessary plant nutrients without the need for chemical fertilizers, such as with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Our Pro Farm portfolio of technologies of foliar, soil and seed treatment products, enhances growth and yields with much smaller quantities of plant nutrients than would normally be applied to crops by combining key micronutrients with bio-based macromolecules from processed wood waste. We also formally collaborate with the Plant Nutrition division of Compass Minerals to mine our collection of microorganisms for those that help plants take up nutrients more efficiently.
 
Plant Health
 
Plant health products are generally referred to in the industry as plant biostimulants, which the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”) proposed to define as “a substance(s) or micro-organism(s) that, when applied to seeds, plants, or the rhizosphere, stimulates natural processes to enhance or benefit nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, or crop quality and yield.” Since plant stimulants are registered by individual states instead of by the EPA, this is the first time that there is a proposed national definition for this category in the United States.

-


While various coalitions around the world continue work on a common national or international regulatory framework for biostimulants, because of the lower regulatory barriers, there are many more companies developing and selling biostimulants than bioprotection products, and the quality and efficacy of some of the biostimulant products may not match the manufacturers’ claims. We entered this market in 2018 with Haven, a coconut extract based abiotic stress protectant developed for increasing crop yields and quality, especially when crops are stressed by drought and UV radiation (sunburn) conditions.
 
Key Agricultural Categories
 
Seed Treatments
 
We believe that seed treatments, where crop protection, crop nutrition and plant stimulant products are applied to the surface of seeds before or at planting, are the breakout category for biological agricultural products. While industry estimates vary, our research shows that the global seed treatment market was approximately $4.7 billion in 2018, and Absolute Reports, a market research firm, estimates the biological seed treatment market to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% to $1.38 billion in 2023. Most seed treatments today consist of chemical pesticides enhanced with biostimulant and bioprotection technologies. Indeed, one of our Marrone product lines is now used as a seed treatment, both alone and stacked with other Marrone products, and two other product lines as well as our Pro Farm products are in development as seed treatments.
Organic Production
 
Certified organic crops such as food, feed, fiber and ornamental plants, are produced without the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers, genetic modification or any other bioengineering or adulteration. As such, organic growers are limited in the number of alternatives for pest management and crop nutrition. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, published national production and labeling standards for organic food marketed in the United States in 2000. These standards have contributed to the growth of organic food consumption in the United States, and other countries have implemented similar programs. According to the Organic Trade Association, a trade association of organic suppliers, in 2019, U.S. organic sales of food and fiber were $52.5 billion, of which $47.9 billion were organic food sales, representing 5.7% of all food sales. In 2018, organic food sales grew 6.3% compared to only 2.3% growth for total food sales. Organic fruits and vegetables comprised $17.4 billion of sales in 2018, up 5.4% from 2017. Globally, organic food sales surpassed $100 billion in 2018, with 71.5 million hectares planted, according to a study by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture performed on behalf of the International Foundation for Organic Agriculture. We believe this growing demand is primarily driven by concerns about food safety and the adverse environmental effects of conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified crops. All of our EPA-registered products on the market today are certified for use in organic farming.
Regenerative Production
 
Regenerative agriculture, while not a new concept, has experienced a resurgence as growers seek to bring further resilience and sustainability to farming. Regenerative agriculture is a system of farming principles and practices that increases biodiversity, enriches soils, improves watersheds, enhances the ecosystem and promotes higher health and vitality for farming and ranching communities, while at the same time offering increased crop yields and resilience to climate instability. Robert Rodale, founder of the Rodale Institute, recently coined the term “regenerative organic” to describe a holistic approach to farming that goes beyond the current organic certification to also consider pasture-based animal welfare, fairness for farmers and workers, soil health and land management. Biological products fit well into regenerative agriculture by improving growers’ bottom line without harm to the environment and in some cases improving soil health. In February 2020, we announced a study conducted with the help of the University of California Graduate School of Management that showed that our products have a lower carbon footprint than competing chemical pesticides. In addition, Ennoble, a biofumigant we are developing, was shown in an internal study to reduce harmful plant pathogens while enhancing the microbiome of soil microorganisms, known to be beneficial to soil and plant health.

Other Target Markets
 
We are also taking steps to commercialize our existing crop protection products, or variations thereof, for other markets. For example, we have launched our Cultivated Garden (CG) versions of Regalia, Grandevo and Venerate for greenhouse, ornamental and medicinal plant use. Although conventional chemical pesticides have traditionally serviced these markets, governmental regulations are restricting their use, and reports indicate that end users increasingly value environmentally friendly products, with some households willing to forego pest control treatments entirely if alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides are not available.
 
In addition, we have developed Zequanox to address the damage caused by invasive zebra and quagga mussels, which clog pipes, disrupt ecosystems, encrust infrastructure and blanket beaches with razor-sharp shells. Industry reports estimate that these mussels cause approximately $1.0 billion in damage and associated control costs annually in parts of the United States alone. There are limited treatment options available, many of which are toxic to aquatic flora and fauna. To date, most treatment options have been focused either on manual removal of the mussels, which is time consuming and costly, or conventional chemical treatments, which potentially jeopardize the environment and human health and are coming increasing scrutiny by regulatory agencies.
 
Benefits of Biological Agricultural Products
 
While conventional chemical pesticides are often effective in controlling pests, some of these chemicals are acutely toxic, some are suspected carcinogens, and neurotoxins, and some can have other harmful effects on the environment and non-target organisms, such as pollinators and fish. Health and environmental concerns have prompted stricter legislation around the use of conventional chemical pesticides, particularly in Europe, where the use of some highly toxic or endocrine-disrupting chemical pesticides are banned or severely limited and the importation of produce is subject to strict regulatory standards on pesticide residues. Over the past two decades, U.S. regulatory agencies have also developed stricter standards and regulations, especially California, which, for example, recently restricted the use of the insecticide chlorpyrifos, along with New York and Hawaii. Furthermore, a growing shift in consumer preference towards organic and sustainable food production has led many large, global food retailers to require their supply chains to implement these practices, including the use of bio-based pest management and fertilizer solutions, water and energy efficiency practices and localized food product sourcing.
 
Aside from the health and environmental concerns, conventional chemical pesticide users face additional challenges such as pest resistance and reduced worker productivity as workers may not return to the fields for a certain period of time after treatment. Costs of using conventional chemical pesticides are also increasing due to a number of factors, including raw materials costs, stringent regulatory requirements and pest resistance to conventional chemical pesticides, which requires increasing application rates or the use of more expensive alternative products. Twenty-five percent of carbon emissions come from agriculture. Therefore the carbon footprint of agricultural production is under scrutiny, with an increased focus on production practices, tools and technologies that can be more climate friendly, including reduced and more efficient use of crop inputs, including and pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products.
 
With increasing costs, regulatory and consumer pressure on conventional chemical pesticides, fertilizers and genetically modified crops and the efficacy of biological pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products become more widely recognized among growers, biological agricultural products are gaining popularity and represent a strong growth sector. Growers are increasingly incorporating biological products into their integrated pest management (IPM) production programs as they recognize biological products can increase yields, quality and return on investment. Biological products help create the type of sustainable, regenerative agriculture programs that growers, consumers and food companies increasingly emphasize.
 
Many biological products can perform as well as or better than conventional agricultural products. The low cost of gene sequencing and advancements in molecular tools, such as tools to measure plant and microbe responses, at a genetic level, to external stimuli (e.g. fermentation media, bioprotectants and biostimulants) and new formulation technologies have led to significant improvements in the development of biological products. When used in rotation or in spray tank mixtures or combined on the seed with conventional chemical products, biological products can increase crop yields and quality over chemical-only programs. Industry reports, as well as our own research, indicate that biological products can affect plant physiology and morphology in ways that may improve crop yield and can increase the efficacy of conventional chemical products. In addition, pests rarely develop resistance to bioprotection products due to their complex modes of action. Likewise, bioprotection products have been shown to extend the product life of conventional chemical pesticides and limit the development of pest resistance, a key issue facing users of conventional chemical pesticides, by eliminating pests that survive conventional chemical pesticide treatments. Most biological products are listed for use in organic farming, providing those growers with compelling options to protect or increase yields and quality. Given their generally lower toxicity compared with many conventional chemical products, biological products can add flexibility to harvest timing and worker re-entry times and can improve worker safety. Many bioprotection products are also exempt from regulations limiting residues levels that apply to conventional chemical pesticides. Bioprotection products may not be subject to chemical residue restrictions by food retailers and governmental agencies (“exempt from tolerance”), which provides growers with greater flexibility to use biological products in the critical last few sprays before harvest and still allow growers export their crops to the higher priced and array of export markets.

From an environmental perspective, biological products have significant advantages over conventional agricultural products, which not only helps growers and consumers, but also can reduce development and commercialization costs. Biological products have low toxicity, posing low risk to most non-target organisms, including humans, other mammals, birds, fish and beneficial insects. Biological products are biodegradable, resulting in less risk to surface water and groundwater and generally have low air-polluting volatile organic compound content. In addition, biological products can increase soil health, fit into regenerative agriculture systems and reduce growers’ carbon footprint, largely due to the significantly lower overall energy consumption in the manufacture of biological products. Because biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks than conventional pesticides, bio pesticides typically require significantly fewer toxicological and environmental safety studies to demonstrate product safety. The reduced time to review a smaller data package usually associated with biopesticides results in a lower registration fee. As a result, both the time and money required to bring a new product to market are significantly reduced.
 
Our Solution
 
We produce novel, cost competitive and effective biopesticide/bioprotection, bionutrition, and biostimulant products that are designed to be compatible with existing pest management and crop production practices, equipment and infrastructure. This allows them to be used as alternatives to, or mixed with, conventional chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Additionally, our products are available in markets for which there are no available conventional chemicals or the use of conventional chemical products may not be desirable or permissible because of health and environmental concerns, or because the development of pest resistance has reduced the efficacy of conventional chemical pesticides. We believe that compared with conventional chemical products, our products:

● | can be competitive from a cost benefit perspective and provide added return on investment to our customers; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | are exempt from residue restrictions applicable to conventional chemical pesticides in both the agriculture and water markets; 
● | provide viable alternatives where conventional chemical pesticides and fertilizers and genetically modified crops are subject to regulatory restrictions; 
● | meet stringent organic farming and regenerative organic requirements; 
● | comply with market-imposed requirements for sustainability by food processors and retailers; 
● | improve worker productivity by shortening field re-entry times after spraying and allowing spraying up to the time of harvest; 
● | are less likely to result in the development of pest resistance; 
● | can result in significant net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and 
● | are environmentally and pollinator friendly.

-


In addition, our experience has shown that when our products are combined with conventional chemical pesticides and fertilizers, they can:
 

● | increase the effectiveness of conventional chemical products while reducing their required application levels; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increase levels of pest control and consistency of control; 
● | increase plant vigor and crop yields; 
● | increase crop quality, including producing crops with higher levels of protein, better taste and color and more attractive flowers; and 
● | delay the development of pest resistance to conventional chemical pesticides. 

 
We believe that the benefits of our products will encourage sustained adoption by end users. For example, we have seen that growers that have used our products on a trial basis in one year have generally continued to use our products in higher levels in subsequent years.
 
Finally, we are proud of the results of our recently completed study, conducted in cooperation with the UC-Davis Graduate School of Management, showing that switching from conventional chemical pesticide products to our current biopesticides would, potentially, result in average net reductions of greenhouse gas emissions of 69% to 91% (or 39 to 46 Kilograms of CO2 equivalents per acre per year). We believe the environmental benefits of our products and our promotion of environmental stewardship, social responsibility and good governance (“ESG”) through our leadership in the sustainable agriculture movement puts our Company in a strong market position as customers, strategic partners, investors and other stakeholders continue to assess ESG factors in their decision making.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Commitment to Biological Products
 
Our belief in and commitment to our vision is our greatest strength. We believe that the world needs more regenerative, organic and sustainable products and practices, and our goal is to champion that cause with transparency for consumers, and affordability and high performance for growers. Our experience has shown that by using biological pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products, growers can benefit the environment and produce healthier food while improving yields. Additionally, biological products have modes of action that differ fundamentally from conventional chemical products. We believe MBI has long been recognized as a thought leader in the biological product industry, and we have consistently sought to educate growers in the use and benefits of these products, both alone and mixed with conventional chemical products. We believe our drive to convert agricultural acres to these sustainable practices will make us disruptive. We believe biological products are the future of agriculture.
Commercially Available Products for Fast Growing Market Categories
 
Our commercially available biological product portfolio provides growers with comprehensive solutions from planting to harvest: increasing plant vigor and health, controlling pests and diseases, reducing crop stress, increasing yields and improving plant nutrient use efficiency, all of which provide growers a better return on investment for their farming operation. We currently offer six EPA-approved crop protection lines, including Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Stargus, and our recently acquired Jet-Ag/Jet-Oxide offering. We also offer Haven, an abiotic stress solution that is not subject to EPA registration and that we introduced in 2018, and our subsidiary Pro Farm, which we acquired in September 2019, has a portfolio of bionutrition and fertilizer products based on the similar technology for use as seed, soil and foliar treatments, including UBP Seed Treatment, UBP-110, Foramin ST 0-0-11, and Foramin 0-0-8. In addition, in January 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Albaugh for our Venerate product, to be included in their seed treatment platform, which expanded our reach to seed treatment and several millions of acres of row crops including cotton, soybeans and corn. In 2018 we launched the CG (Cultivated Garden) line for Regalia, Grandevo and Venerate, which is targeted for medicinal plant growers, greenhouse flower and vegetable growers, home gardeners and small acreage farmers.

We believe we will be able to leverage growers’ positive experiences using our older products to accelerate adoption of our newer products, increasing the number of product applications in the same season and optimizing our product portfolio. We believe a product portfolio that encompasses a range of grower needs from planting to bloom to harvest allows us to compete with larger companies, to strengthen relationships with growers and distributors and to not be dependent on any one product or product category and to grow faster. Further, we will continue to pursue opportunities to broaden the commercial applications and expand the use of our industry-leading portfolio of existing products lines into several key end markets, including large-acre row crop applications, seed treatment, turf, medicinal plant and hemp crops, forestry and public health to help drive significant growth for our company.
 
Highly Characterized and Proprietary Natural Product Chemistries
 
Our products generally have modes of action that are often both complex and novel. Our expertise in natural product chemistry and analytical chemistry enables us to identify and characterize the compounds produced by the microorganisms, which we optimize and patent. Because we can measure key active compounds in product fermentation and formulation, and do not need to rely on live microbes, we have developed products that are more consistent from batch to batch, have longer shelf lives and allowing them to be more effective against a broader spectrum of pests and applications. We believe this also enables our products to be more effective than competitor biological products that are based solely on live microorganism with little or no characterization of the active biochemical compounds. Our focus on the natural product chemistries allows us to continually drive lower costs, higher product gross margins and efficacy through higher yields and potency. Further, as a result, our technology does not just include patents related to microbes, but also patents and trade secrets related to the work we have done to characterize, formulate, develop and manufacture our products, giving us a strong proprietary position in all our commercialized product lines.
Rapid and Efficient Development Process
 
We believe we have demonstrated our ability to develop and commercialize novel and effective products faster and at a lower cost than most developers of biological products. For example, we have moved each of Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Stargus, Haven and Zequanox through development, EPA approval and first U.S. launch in approximately four years or less at a cost of $3.0 million to $6.0 million per product. Thereafter, we have continued to develop and refine these products, reducing manufacturing costs, producing new formulations, applying for expanded use labels and seeking new overseas markets, in each case at a cost of less than $10.0 million per product line internationally. In comparison, a report from Phillips McDougall shows that the average cost for major agrichemical companies to bring a new crop protection product to market has been over $286.0 million, and these products have historically taken an average of eleven years to move through development, regulatory approval and market launch.
In-House Manufacturing Capabilities
 
In 2014, we completed the repurpose of a manufacturing facility that we purchased in July 2012 by installing three 20,000-liter fermentation tanks and constructing a dedicated building to house them, which has enabled us to manufacture certain of our products in-house, including our National Organic Program compliant products. In 2017, we completed a medium-scale granulation line for Grandevo WDG (Wettable Fry Granule). In 2018, we completed the installation of an automated packaging and labeling line. We have shown that greater control of our own manufacturing capacity allows us to scale-up processes and institute process changes more quickly and efficiently while ultimately lowering manufacturing costs over time to achieve desired margins and protecting the proprietary position of our products. We continue to use third party manufacturers for our Venerate, Majestene/Zelto, Haven, Pro Farm and Jet-Ag products and for spray-dried powder formulations of Grandevo and Zequanox. We are developing plans to retrofit our fermentation tanks in order to permit manufacture of Venerate and Majestene at our plant, and we also expect to bring Haven production into the plant in 2020. We also have a 12% ownership interest in the Russian plant that supplies third party vendors with raw materials for and produces some of our Pro Farm products.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Develop Integrated Programs Under the BioUnite Brand
 
Our products are not “for organic use only.” We have shown that integrating biologicals into agricultural programs with conventional products can provide higher yields and quality than chemical-only programs across a broad range of specialty and row crops. We have branded the integrated program “BioUnite”: “the power of biology with the performance of chemistry.” We believe this approach is driving growth and market share in our targeted key crops.
Promote and Enhance Seed Treatment Portfolio
 
We expect that eventually, substantially all seeds for use in modern agriculture will be treated with one or more biological products. Accordingly, promoting and enhancing our seed treatment portfolio has been a strategic focus for our company. Since 2017, our Venerate technology has been used in Albaugh’s BIOst-branded seed treatment products, stacked along with their traditional chemistries and our technology is also used in Albaugh’s all-biological seed treatment for organic production. We have also developed an all-biological treatment with Groundwork BioAg’s mycorrhizae technology, which has shown efficacy as good as or better than competing seed treatments, whether using synthetic chemicals alone or in combinations with other biological products. Our recently acquired subsidiary Pro Farm is rapidly expanding our global revenues from seed treatments, especially in Europe, where Pro Farm has entered into a strategic, long-term exclusive commercial agreement with Corteva, Inc., one of the two largest seed companies in the world, to develop and commercialize a suite of seed-applied biological products based on our proprietary Pro Farm technology platform. In Latin America, hundreds of trials and demos are underway for seed treatment use of our portfolio of Marrone and Pro Farm bionutrient and bioprotection products.
Acquire or License Accretive Products and Technologies
 
We actively search for products and technologies that can enhance our portfolio and grow our business. In the third quarter of 2019, we acquired Pro Farm and two product lines from Jet Harvest Solutions. The Pro Farm acquisition provides us with an expanded international footprint in markets where biologicals are growing faster than the United States and significantly expanded our seed treatment portfolio. We expect sales of our Pro Farm products to drive rapid growth at gross margins that are expected to be higher than our current bioprotection products, and such sales contributed significantly to our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Jet products are complementary to our fungicide product lines, Regalia and Stargus: Regalia and Stargus prevent fungal and bacterial diseases, while Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide can clean them up after they are already present.
Target International Markets
 
Expanding international sales is an important component of our growth strategy, but the global markets for pest management products are intensely competitive and highly regulated. Our plan is to focus on key countries and regions with the largest and fastest growing biopesticide and plant health product markets for specialty crops and select row crops. We are working with regional distributors and distributors in key countries who have brand recognition and understand how to test and market biopesticides. Our acquisition of Pro Farm has catapulted our international business, especially in Europe where we expect Pro Farm products to be applied to 10 million hectares in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons through a collaboration with Corteva, Inc. one of the largest global seed companies. As bionutrition and biofertilizer products, our Pro Farm lines can enter international markets sooner than our bioprotection products. We also expect our acquisition of Pro Farm will be a driver of growth in Latin America, where we are conducting hundreds of trials and demonstrations.

Leverage Our Technology Through Collaborations
 
Our focus and expertise in biological products and natural product chemistries, as well as our 18,000-specimen microbial collection that is rich in pipeline product candidates, allow us to be a partner of choice for other businesses looking for development partners and for larger companies wanting to leverage their technology into new combination products. For example, Compass Minerals has partnered with us to tap into our microbial collection and potentially combine our technologies and resources with their plant nutrients to develop new products that improve the efficiency of plant nutrient uptake. In addition, Valagro has partnered with us to combine their seaweed extracts with our microorganisms to create products with enhanced functionality and value for growers.

Regalia Product Line
 

● | Biofungicide, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Crop Protection (Specialty and Row Crops), Home and Garden, Ornamentals, Seed Treatment 
● | Commercially Available Domestically and Internationally 

 
Regalia is the master brand name for our plant extract-based fungicidal biopesticide, or “biofungicide,” product line.
 
Regalia is a liquid formulation made from an extract of the giant knotweed plant and acts by turning on a plant’s “immune system,” a process called induced systemic resistance. Regalia also enhances the efficacy of major conventional chemical fungicides, and we have received issued patents on this synergism. Regalia also is effective for seed treatment of soybean, corn and cotton, for which we have filed a patent application and have field tests underway, and we have received an issued patent on the effects on root growth and yield when Regalia is applied to the seed or as a root stimulant.
 
We obtained an exclusive license relating to the technology used in our Regalia product line while Regalia was in the process development and formulation stage of product development. In addition to developing the supply chain to commercially market the product, using our natural product chemistry expertise, we developed an analytical method to measure and characterize the key compounds in the plant extract, and we improved the bioavailability these compounds several times in subsequent, new formulations, providing Regalia with a broader spectrum of activity and better efficacy than the original licensed product. In addition, we improved the physical properties of our Regalia formulations and developed four formulations that meet organic farming standards. We have filed several patent applications with respect to these innovations. In addition, we have received a U.S. patent for modulating plant growth by treating roots of plants with Regalia (or other compounds or extracts of knotweed) and transplanting the plants into soil. The European Patent Office (EPO) has granted a patent relating to the use of Reynoutria sachalinensis as either a plant or seed growth promoter. We have also received a patent on the synergistic combination of Regalia or knotweed extract and some important chemical fungicides.
 
We first launched Regalia SC, an earlier formulation of Regalia, into the Florida fresh tomatoes market in December 2008. This formulation had a limited label with a few crops and uses on the label but was not compliant for organic listing. We have since developed improved and expanded product versions as shown in the table below.

Grandevo is based on a new species of microorganism, Chromobacterium subtsugae, which was discovered by a scientist at the USDA-ARS in Beltsville, Maryland, and which we have licensed and commercialized. Grandevo is a powerful feeding inhibitor: insects and mites become agitated when encountering it, stop feeding in less than one minute, and will starve, or, if they do ingest it, die from disruption to their digestive system. Grandevo also reduces the number of eggs or offspring of many target insects and mites. Grandevo is particularly effective against certain chewing insects (such as caterpillars, some weevils such as pecan weevil and beetles) and sucking insects (such as Lygus mealybugs, as well as thrips and psyllids, which are respectively known as “corn lice” and “plant lice”) and some flies, such as the spotted wing drosophila. Trials to date and reports from grower use have shown instances of commercial levels of efficacy as good as the leading conventional chemical pesticides on a range of chewing and sucking insect and mite pests, including two invasive species of psyllid affecting citrus and potato crops. Grandevo has also shown significant control of other pests such as plant-feeding fly larvae, white grubs in turf grass. Grandevo has also shown efficacy against corn rootworm, a major pest of corn, which has reportedly developing been resistance to corn engineered for rootworm control. Grandevo has also shown efficacy against other soil pests, including wireworms, root maggots and nematodes. Field trials are ongoing to further characterize Grandevo’s activity against new foliar and soil-borne pests in international markets where there are often different but related pests. Grandevo has been tested over three years in the United States in-furrow and as a seed treatment for soil insects and nematodes on corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat. In 2019 seed treatment trials in Europe showed good performance, resulting in higher yields on corn. As liquid formulations are favored in the seed treatment market, a key strategic area for our company, we have developed and are testing a new liquid formulation of Grandevo that is not yet commercially available.
 
We obtained a co-exclusive license for the bacterial strain used in our Grandevo product line while Grandevo was undergoing primary screening as a potential product candidate. However, as of January 2018, the USDA has indicated that we are the only current licensee. Since licensing the microorganism, we completed the testing and development necessary to produce and commercialize an EPA-approved product and have filed our own patent applications with respect to the microorganism, including its genome, synergistic combinations with conventional chemical pesticides, product formulations containing the bacterial strain as well as the chemistry produced by the microorganism upon which Grandevo is based. We have issued U.S. patents on one of these novel compounds produced by the bacteria and novel insecticidal and nematicidal uses. We also have an issued patent on the water dispersible granule formulation of Grandevo. All Grandevo formulations are USDA National Organic Program compliant.
 
Field trials supporting international expansion of Grandevo are underway or completed in many key countries around the world. A June 2015 policy decision by the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority and a Working Group of EU Member States has allowed Grandevo, which contains only non-viable bacterial cells, to be evaluated as a microbial pesticide. Until this EU decision, only pesticides containing live microbes could be evaluated under EU regulation. Grandevo is also being assessed under the Netherlands Government’s “Green Deal” Initiative, which has been created with an aim to “speed up the sustainability of PPPs (plant protection products) in agriculture and horticulture by facilitating the authorization of green PPPs with a low risk for humans, animals and the environment.” Grandevo has received completeness determination from the Netherlands, and the process has begun for the evaluation for Annex 1 listing and commercialization in the EU. A draft decision completed by the Netherlands in 2016 recommended we conduct certain additional toxicology and product characterization studies which are scheduled for completion in 2020. Thereafter, we plan to re-submit Grandevo to the EU in 2021. Our main product labels for our Grandevo product line, as well as our next anticipated label, are summarized in the table below:

Venerate, a liquid formulation, is based on a microbial fermentation of a new bacterial species we isolated using our proprietary discovery process. We have identified compounds produced by the microorganism in Venerate that control a broad range of chewing and sucking insects and mites, as well as flies and plant parasitic nematodes, that on contact, act as a novel growth regulator, disrupting molting and development to the next stage. This mode of action is complementary to the anti-feeding effects of Grandevo and we often recommend them both in programs, starting with Grandevo before populations increase then with Venerate for population control. We have conducted field trials on several crops and insects and mites, many of which show efficacy as good as leading conventional chemical pesticides. Like Grandevo, Venerate has shown positive results in field trials against soil insects of corn, wheat and soybeans applied both in-furrow and as seed treatments, and has shown broad spectrum activity across a wide range of pests, including Asian citrus psyllid, corn rootworm, and certain caterpillars and weevils. Venerate controls some pests that Grandevo is weaker on such as scales, walnut husk fly and pepper weevil, while Grandevo is better on spotted wing drosophila and pecan weevil. Both work well on mites, Lygus, thrips, whiteflies, psyllids and mealybugs. We have focused on the application of Venerate against navel orangeworm on almonds with our BioUnite program in California. All commercial formulations of Venerate are USDA National Organic Program Compliant.
 
We have received a U.S. patent on the microorganism and received patents on the natural product compounds that demonstrate insecticidal and nematicidal activity, and on product formulations containing the microorganism.
 
In August 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Albaugh to expand our reach into the row crop market, including crops such as cotton, soybeans and corn, through Albaugh’s BIOST platform. The BIOST platform delivers a broad portfolio of highly effective and proven biological seed treatments through proprietary formulations that utilize our Venerate product. We supply Albaugh with Venerate, and Albaugh is responsible for the promotion, sale and services related to BIOST products. In 2019, Venerate was applied to five million acres of cotton, corn and soybeans in the United States.
 
Field trials for international expansion of Venerate are underway or completed in many key countries around the world. Our main product labels for our Venerate product line, as well as our next anticipated label, are summarized in the table below:

Majestene is a bionematicide and soil insecticide we have developed based on the microorganism in Venerate. This nematicide is active against a broad range of nematodes, and in field trials it has been as effective as the leading conventional chemical nematicide against soybean cyst, root knot, lesion, stunt, reniform, lance and burrowing nematodes. Crops tested include soybean, corn, cotton, strawberry, turf, tomato, pepper, squash, potato, sweet potato, and banana. We consider our new improved Majestene product (MBI-306) that we are developing to be one of the most promising new products for the company. In 2019, we demonstrated high performance of this version in furrow on corn and soybeans and for soil and foliar treatments of nematode and insect pests at substantially lower rates per acre than our current product. In some trials, it outperformed Majestene and the current commercial chemical standard, and also outperformed Venerate XC against foliar insects. R&D and Regulatory are conducting all the work to submit MBI-306 to the EPA in late 2020 or early 2021. All commercially available Majestene formulations are USDA National Organic Program compliant. We have been issued a U.S. patent for use of the bacterial strain in Majestene/Zelto for use as a nematicide. Our main product labels for our Majestene product line, as well as our next anticipated label, are summarized in the table below:

Stargus is based on microbial fermentations of a newly identified Bacillus nakamurai strain we isolated using our proprietary screening platform. Stargus is a biofungicide, targeting difficult to control plant diseases such as Sclerotinia white molds, gray mold/bunch rot and downy mildews. We have identified different compounds, some of which are novel, produced by the microorganism in Stargus that control a broad range of plant diseases. We have received a U.S. patent covering fungicidal uses and have been issued a U.S. patent on related claims. We have also completed sufficient field trials in Europe to support uses on potatoes, grapes and sugar beets, and anticipate submitting Stargus to the Netherlands, as our EU rapporteur member state, in 2020. We are producing Stargus with a third-party manufacturer. All Stargus formulations are USDA National Organic Program compliant.

Haven is a plant health product that is applied to the leaves of plants to reduce sun stress. In stressful environments, such as intense sunlight or drought, crops lose yield and quality. Haven is based on a technology of naturally-derived, plant-based (coconut) compounds that we licensed from Kao Corporation for use in the United States. The licensed patents are directed to methods of promoting plant growth and increasing biomass and crop yield. Haven reflects light and heat from leaves, which lowers plant temperatures, resulting in less stress to the crops and higher yields and quality. Haven also increases the plant’s uptake of water and nutrients when under stress. Field trials in 2014 in the United States and Chile demonstrated a reduction in sun-stressed fruit and an increase in quality characteristics on citrus, apples and grapes, increased yields on walnuts, almonds and wheat, often equal to or better than the commercial standard, and increased turf growth. Unlike competing products, Haven does not leave an undesirable deposit or residue on crops. Field trials in over the last four years have demonstrated increased yields, plant growth and/or quality of almonds, walnuts, apples, corn, tomatoes, blackberries, grapes and citrus. As an abiotic stress solution, Haven does not require EPA registration, and we launched Haven commercially in March 2017. We received California approval in January 2018 and approval for Canada in December 2018. Commercialization efforts are also underway in the European Union, Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries. Our main product labels for Haven product lines are summarized in the table below:

● | Water Treatment: Targets Invasive Mussels (In-Pipe and Open Water Habitat Restoration) 
● | Commercially Available Domestically and in Canada 
● | USDA “BioPreferred” Program Certified Product 

 
Zequanox addresses the problem of invasive zebra and quagga mussels, which clog pipes, disrupt ecosystems, encrust infrastructure and blanket beaches with razor-sharp shells. These mussels cause approximately $1.0 billion in damage and associated control costs annually in parts of the United States alone. There are limited treatment options available, many of which are time-consuming and costly, or harm aquatic flora and fauna. Zequanox is a biomolluscicide derived from a common microbe found in soil and water bodies, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Zequanox is an environmentally friendly, bio-based pest management product that is designed to kill over 75% of invasive mussels in treated pipe systems without causing collateral ecological damage.

Zequanox is the only EPA-approved product for open water application in the United States other than copper, which is rarely used due to its negative environmental effects. At recommended application rates, Zequanox is not toxic to other aquatic life, including ducks, fish, crustaceans and other bivalve species such as native clams or mussels. Zequanox is safe to workers, less labor intensive and requires shorter treatment times as compared to conventional chemical pesticides. Zequanox can be used by power plants and raw water treatment facilities as an alternative to conventional chemical treatments such as chlorine, or as a complement to those products.
 
We entered into a license agreement with The University of the State of New York pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive license under the University’s rights relating to the bacterial strain used in our Zequanox product line. Their patents under this license have since expired and we have no further obligations under this agreement.
 
We have not allocated any research and development resources to Zequanox since 2014, as we have elected to prioritize our agriculture business, however we continue to work with selected power and industrial customers for in-pipe treatments, as well as with government and non-governmental organizations for open water treatments, including a successful fisheries habitat restoration treatment in Lake Michigan.

Our commercially available Pro Farm product lines are biological fertilizers in various formulations based on the same underlying technology. We use renewable forestry industry byproducts, specifically tree waste from pulp and paper manufacturing processes to produce a molecular level complex that contains macro- and micronutrients in its matrix. In our proprietary process, organic acids and biopolymers are complexed with nutrients into a single organic molecular complex that allows plants to absorb up to 16 beneficial elements in a novel and more effective way (i.e., at a lower dose and lower cost). The nutrient composition and novel nutrient delivery mechanism are designed to have an overall positive effect on the plant physiology, mitigating adverse effects of abiotic stress and improving both yield and quality, especially under less favorable conditions. The technology is protected by two issued patents with a U.S. patent application pending. Our Pro Farm subsidiary has entered into a strategic, long-term exclusive commercial agreement with Corteva, Inc. to develop and commercialize a suite of seed-applied biological products based on our proprietary Pro Farm technology platform. Corteva has announced that they intend to use our Lumi-Bio-branded seed treatment products on 10 million hectares (corn, sugar beets and canola) for the 2020/2021 growing season.

Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide Product Lines
 

● | Fungicide and bactericide 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | Crops, Turf and Ornamentals. Structures, surfaces and pipes 
● | Commercially Available Domestically and Canada 

 
Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide are peroxyacetic acid-based plant health product lines. Prior to acquiring our Jet products in September 2019, we distributed Jet-Ag in certain regions of the United States pursuant to an agreement we entered into an agreement with Jet Harvest Solutions in May 2017. This prior experience as a distributor has allowed us to quickly begin integrating the acquired Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide technology into our overall platform. For example, we have conducted early research into the use of Jet-Ag in conjunction with our Stargus fungicide to control white mold in dry bean production. Compared with the untreated control, we saw a 66% reduction in the incidence of white mold, and somewhat improved control versus the standard chemical treatment. We believe this is one of the many possible applications for growers to use Jet-Ag/Jet-Oxide in an integrated disease management system. We are also aware that many growers have been using a tank-mix of Regalia and Jet-Ag/Jet-Oxide for disease control on a variety of horticultural crops.
 
We believe that our Jet-Ag portfolio opens opportunities for us in the disinfectant market, as sanitation is an increasing concern in agriculture particularly with the recent implementation of portions of the federal Food Safety Modernization Act, that targets management and reduction of food-borne microbial pathogens. In addition, a new regulation in California will require sanitation of water used on leafy greens. We believe the Jet-Ag biological solution can give organic and conventional growers alike a proven option with a strong crop safety profile.


Product Pipeline
 
Our pipeline of Marrone products consists of two product lines under active development, MBI-306 and MBI-014/015, as well as product candidates in various stages of development, including products submitted to the EPA for registration as well as other early-stage discoveries. We have implemented a prioritization plan for our Marrone pipeline candidates, focusing first on those that are expected to have the greatest near-term growth potential and fill the greatest unmet market need.
MBI-306 (“Majestene 3.0”)
 

● | Bionematicide, Bioinsecticide and Biomiticide 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Crop Protection, Home and Garden, Turf 
● | Under Development 

 
MBI-306 is an enhanced version of Majestene (which we refer to as “Majestene 3.0” or “Super Majestene”)) that significantly increases the level of the pesticidal compounds produced in fermentation. As a result, the dose rate used on crops is much lower than the present version of Majestene, with targeted reduction of the amount of product used on the seed from approximately 6.0 oz/acre to 0.5-1.0 oz/acre. We believe this will provide us a more competitive product for seed treatment. For soil uses, such as in-furrow applications, 2019 field trials showed that the use rate can drop from the current 128 oz/Acre to a significantly lower 10.5-21.0 oz/acre while still providing the same control of corn rootworms and seed corn maggots. MBI-306 is different enough from Majestene that it requires a new submission to the EPA. We are currently conducting toxicology studies, fermentation and formulation work in order to prepare for the new submission.
 
MBI-014 and 015
 

● | Bioherbicide 
--+-------------------------------------------
● | Crop Protection, Home and Garden, Turf 
● | Under Development

--


MBI-014 and MBI-015 (formerly referred to as MBI-010) are based on the same species of bacteria used to produce Venerate and Majestene/Zelto, which we isolated using a proprietary discovery process that identifies herbicides that inhibit a certain plant enzyme. MBI-014/015 is manufactured using different fermentation process to produce several herbicidal compounds, some of which are novel, which can kill the weeds when applied to the foliage or taken up by the roots or seeds. We are focusing MBI-014/015 on post-emergence applications (sprayed on the weeds after they emerge) against a range of weeds, including palmer amaranth and water hemp that are resistant to leading conventional chemical herbicides, such as glyphosate. MBI-014/015 have also demonstrated a novel mode of action, and some of their active compounds are transmitted systemically through the vascular structure of weeds. These compounds were found by our USDA collaborators to be orders of magnitude more active than glyphosate, glufosinate and several other chemical herbicide chemistries. We have been issued patents with respect to the MBI-014 formulation uses and its associated natural product compounds as an herbicide. We also received an issued U.S. patent on the process we used to discover MBI-014 and certain other bioherbicides.
 
MBI-014 was submitted to the EPA in August 2018. The EPA subsequently requested additional toxicology studies, which have been completed and the dossier is being prepared for submission to EPA in 2020. During the time spent conducting the additional EPA requirements, we developed an improved, more concentrated, lower cost version, MBI-015. Field trials in 2019 showed that we can control pigweeds, specifically palmer amaranth, one of the worst weeds around the world, nearly as well as glufosinate, the commercial standard. As a different formulation, MBI-015 may require separate product registration from the MBI-014 dossier we are currently reviewing whether such registration is required. We plan to consult with the EPA in 2020 on the data requirements for submitting MBI-015, and additional crop safety studies are being planned.


Other Pipeline Candidates
 
We have also developed patented technology relating to a number of other Marrone product candidates, including MBI-601, a biofumigant based on novel and proprietary genus of fungus that has received EPA and California approvals, MBI-304, a bionematicide product candidate based on the microorganism used in Grandevo; MBI-011 and MBI-005, bioherbicides that have received EPA approval; and MBI-302, a bionematicide candidate. We are also developing Stargus in combination with Regalia and a pre-mixture combination of reduced risk fungicides with Regalia. We have a collaboration with another company to develop a pre-mixture of Regalia with a commercial fungicide and, also, to develop Venerate in a pre-mixture with a commercial insecticide.
 
We have also discovered several microorganisms with algaecidal activity, some of which have been tested by third-party collaborators for efficacy, and over 25 additional fungicide, herbicide, insecticide and nematicide candidates using our proprietary screening platform. In addition, we have produced a collection of microorganisms from taxonomic groups that research shows enhance nutrient uptake in plants, reduce stress and otherwise increase plant growth. In 2019 we developed two significant collaborations with these types of microorganisms – with Compass Minerals Plant Nutrition and Valagro. We have selected a subset of our microorganisms to develop plant nutrient products with Compass Minerals that can enhance the uptake of nutrients by the crop and that can enhance seaweed-based biostimulants with Valagro.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
In the United States, we sell our Marrone, Jet and soon in the future the Pro Farm foliar, products through our own internal sales force, which consists of 15 employees focused on managing distributor relationships and creating grower demand for our products. In addition, a dedicated team of 8 employees provide technical service support to both our customers and sales representatives on the use of our products in IPM and crop production programs, both for conventional growers as well as for an expanding number of organic growers. Our sales force covers all major regions in the United States, including California and the Pacific Northwest, the Southeast, the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and the Great Lakes regions, with an emphasis on high-value specialty crops (fruits, nuts and vegetables). We currently sell our crop protection product lines, Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate, Majestene/Zelto and Stargus, Jet-Ag and Jet-Oxide, as well as Haven, through leading agricultural distributors, such as Nutrien Ag, Helena Chemical, Simplot, Wilbur Ellis and Aligned Ag Distributors. These are the same distribution partners that most major agrichemical companies use for delivering solutions to growers across the country. We use Albaugh for distribution of a version of Venerate for the seed treatment market in the United States and Canada.
 
With respect to sales of Marrone products outside of the United States, we have exclusive legacy international distribution agreements for Regalia with major international distributors such as FMC (for certain markets in Latin America) and Syngenta (for specialty crop markets in Europe). Our current strategy is to work with regional distributors and distributors in key countries who have brand recognition, established customer bases, who can effectively conduct field trials and grower demonstrations with biopesticides and lead or assist in regulatory processes and market development. As such, we have signed a number of distribution agreements: Agristar (for Grandevo and Venerate in Mexico), Nufarm (for Grandevo for certain markets in New Zealand and Australia), Jocanima (for Regalia, Grandevo, Venerate and Majestene in the Philippines), Elephant Vert and Kenya Biologics (for Regalia, Venerate, Grandevo and Majestene in certain parts of Africa), Hoptri (Vietnam), Lidorr (Israel), AMC/Agrimatco (Turkey), Disagro (for a Regalia brand in certain countries in Central America) and Kyung Nong Corporation (South Korea for Majestene and Venerate).
 
We sell our Pro Farm products through selected distributors in Europe, Asia and Latin America. For example, Pro Farm has an exclusive contract with Corteva, one of the largest seed companies, to sell seed treatment products in Europe. Pro Farm is also working with numerous companies to improve their biological offerings, such as PGG Wrightson in Uruguay, Agropartners in Bolivia, Agrofertil in Paraguay, EcoRural in Argentina and Ruchi Hi Rich in India. We expect our acquisition of Pro Farm to expand our global distribution network, especially in Latin America. We are hiring sales managers for our Pro Farm products in key territories to help achieve our growth goals and provide support to our seed and distribution customers. We believe we can leverage our existing sales, marketing and distribution network, finding synergies between operations for our Marrone and Pro Farm products, to bring in additional revenues, while enhancing our overall product portfolio.

We derived approximately 88% and 93% of our total revenues from Regalia, Grandevo and Venerate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of our revenues since we sell through highly concentrated, traditional distribution channels. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top two distributors accounted for 40% of our total revenues. Approximately 90% of our business has historically been from the U.S. markets. By 2021, however, we expect that mix to shift significantly due to both sales generated through our Pro Farm subsidiary, sales of our Pro Farm products and continued progress on registrations of our collective product lines in new countries.
 
While the biopesticide industry has been growing, customers in the crop production sectors are generally cautious in their adoption of new products and technologies and may perceive biological agricultural products as less attractive than conventional products. Growers often require on-farm demonstrations of pest management or plant health products, and based on their novel modes of action compared to chemical products, our customers will continue to require education on their use. We are implementing the following strategies to accelerate adoption rates and promote sales of our bio-based pest management and plant health products:
 
Maintain a focused and effective sales and marketing team that shares our values. We have rebuilt our sales and marketing teams, following major turnover in late 2017 and early 2018, including hiring a highly experienced national sales director to train and coach our sales force. In addition, we are now more effectively organizing the data and educational material that we have amassed over ten years of operations on our bio-based products as well as organic and sustainable agricultural practices in order to train and equip our sales staff to communicate and educate distributors and growers. We believe that hiring and training sales and marketing staff with a high level of technical expertise and knowledge regarding the capabilities of our bio-based products, and unwavering belief in the potential and value of biologicals for crop production is essential to expanding adoption of our products by growers and sales to distributors. In addition, we have invested in our field development team to include more technical service activities to support sales. These concerted efforts to build and train our sales and marketing teams are yielding positive results, including growth in sales.
 
Develop an extensive demonstration program. We believe that for growers to be convinced that a biological pest management, plant nutrition or plant health product works, they often must see it for themselves. Growers risk their crop each time they try a new product, and often produce only one crop per year on any given plot of land. Further, bio-based pesticide and plant health products are often applied differently and at different times than conventional chemical products and so may be used incorrectly by an inexperienced grower or advisor, decreasing efficacy. We typically conduct on-farm demonstrations with growers in the first year of association, a grower will then in the second year try one of our products on smaller plots of land and on one crop only to ensure successful application, a typical grower will then progress continued use of our products in future years across more acres, more crops and more products from our product portfolio. In addition, we work with distributors to determine which crops to emphasize in a given year and which area to maximize the effectiveness of our demonstration program.
 
Target early adopters of new pest management technologies. For our biological pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products, we target large commercial growers, who generally set industry standards through more widespread adoption of new pest management technologies they initially test on smaller portions of their crops. We also target organic growers, who are more willing to take risks on new products as they have had few alternatives and great demand for increased yields. We plan to continue to recruit these growers and their consultants to participate in demonstrations and field trials, enabling them to become familiar with our bio-based pest management and plant health products, to experience their benefits firsthand and to promote the use of our products with other growers in their regions.
 
Educate growers about the benefits of our bio-based pest management products. Education is critical to best use of biologicals, which often have different modes of action than chemical products. We will continue to perform on-farm demonstrations and provide field data packages to support and validate our product claims. We will also continue to participate in trade shows and conferences to educate growers and their licensed pest control advisors about the benefits of our biological pest management, plant nutrition and plant health products. We have provided a free application for mobile phone users to assist in calculating tank mix quantities, as well as instructional videos, blogposts, webinars, podcasts, teach-ins, by-line articles and an online course on bio-based pest management products, which can be taken by growers for continuing education credit to maintain crop protection product applicator licenses.

Develop and leverage relationships with key industry influencers. We will continue to develop relationships early in the product development process with influential members within our target markets, including large innovative growers, technical experts at leading agricultural universities, licensed pest control advisors, wineries, food processors, produce packers, and retailers. We believe that educating industry influencers about the benefits of biologicals and our products increases the likelihood that they will recommend our products to our distributors and end users. In addition, food companies and retailers are driven by consumers to require more sustainability and transparency from their grower-suppliers. This consumer-pushed trend is driving awareness with both the grower and food channel of the benefits of biologicals to soil health, the new movements in regenerative agriculture and sustainable crop production programs in general.
 
Leverage the synergies of our sales teams and businesses domestically and internationally. Because of the concentration of large growers in the United States, we can access these customers through our own sales force. For our specialty crop products, we have distribution agreements with national and regional distributors and for seed treatment with Albaugh LLC. Our subsidiary Pro Farm has a seed treatment agreement with Corteva in Europe and with some distributors in Latin America. We believe we can leverage these existing relationships by expanding sales of our Pro Farm product lines through our U.S.-based sales team and distributors and likewise expand sales of our Marrone products through existing Pro Farm product distributors. For future products, distribution agreements will be developed with regional and national distributors or large multinationals on a case-by-case basis, depending on their expertise in the regions. For the fast-growing medicinal plant and hemp market, we have set up several specialty distributors who can benefit from our products. We also are in discussions with consumer home and garden companies to distribute our products.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing processes four our Marrone products are developed in-house at our Davis, California research and development facilities and transferred to our Bangor, Michigan facility, which was formerly used as a biodiesel plant prior to our acquisition in July 2012 or to our manufacturing partners. Biopesticide formulation, microbial fermentation and product packaging are among the facility’s core competencies. We believe in-house manufacturing enhances control and flexibility in production, ensuring quality, strengthening intellectual property security and lowering manufacturing costs over time to achieve desired margins. The facility has room for expansion to install larger drying capacity and larger fermenters to accommodate production of multiple products at significantly higher volumes. In 2017, we added a granulation line for Grandevo WDG and purchased a packaging line, which was placed into service in the first half of 2018.
 
We currently ferment our Grandevo and Zequanox products in our manufacturing facility but continue to use a third-party contractor for formulating them into spray-dried powders. The facility also accommodates full-scale production of Regalia. While we have the ability to produce the majority of our products using our own manufacturing capacity, we currently use third parties to manufacture Venerate and Majestene/Zelto as a result of regulatory requirements for the microorganism that underlies their technology. We are currently working on designs to adapt our fermenters to comply with these regulatory requirements, but it will require additional capital investment to do so. Stargus/Amplitude is also made at a third-party vendor because the Bacillus bacteria produce spores that are hard to contain and could contaminate our Grandevo and Venerate fermentations. We intend to have fermentation of Bacillus at our facility at some point in the future but will require a separate facility from our other products. Haven has been produced using a third party, but we recently successfully validated the production at our Michigan plant and we have plans to bring the process in-house in the near future. We anticipate ramping up production volumes as we expand the facility in the future. We expect to continue to utilize third-party manufactures in North America and the EU for supplemental production capacity to meet excess seasonal demand. As needed, we will also use our own facility or third parties to package and label products.
 
The active ingredient in our Regalia product line is derived from the giant knotweed plant, which is a food and medicinal plant native to China and Japan. We have scaled production of Regalia using a reliable, single supplier that acquires raw knotweed from numerous regional sources and performs an extraction process on this plant, following our specification. The resulting dried extract is shipped to our manufacturing plant for formulations, production and packaging. We do not maintain a long-term supply contract with this supplier, but we have worked with them for ten years. While there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain dried giant knotweed plant extract from our supplier in China at a competitive price point, we estimate that our current supply of the ingredient will be sufficient to manufacture product to meet the next 6 months’ demand. Should we elect or be required to do so, we do not believe that we would have substantial difficulty in finding alternative suppliers as we have identified and received quality knotweed from a number of new possible suppliers, including one from outside China in the event additional inventory or diversified sourcing is necessary.

A majority of the production of our Pro Farm product lines, as well as associated raw materials, is conducted at a third party manufacturing facility in Russia in which we have a 12% ownership stake. A large scale paper and pulp manufacturing site in close proximity to this plant is the main supplier of the wood waste by-product material we use in production. For our Lumibio products we take source custom made bespoke micronutrient mixes formulations from a European third-party supplier and have multiple third-party postproduction facilities in Europe. Our Jet products are manufactured by a third party located in the United States.
 
Research and Development
 
We have leveraged an innovative and market-focused discovery process to generate a robust product line and pipeline. This has included isolating 18,000 microorganisms, testing more than 16,000 of them against multiple pest targets and testing a subset of them for plant health and nutrient uptake enhancement. We have then developed more than one product line based on the same active technology. For example, the Burkholderia rinoiensis microbe on which Venerate is based is also active against a broad range of nematodes, enabling development as our bionematicide product, Majestene/Zelto, and, when fermented under different conditions, produces several herbicidal compounds, enabling development as our bioherbicide product candidate, MBI-014/015. In addition, the Chromobacterium species on which Grandevo is based may also yield a promising bionematicide product, which we have developed as MBI-304 with positive results, both as a seed treatment and with in-furrow applications, over the course of three growing seasons. Developing multiple products based on the same microbe allows for a more efficient use of research, development and manufacturing resources and enables us to leverage capital invested in existing technologies.
 
At this time, we are prioritizing our research and development on supporting our existing products and focusing on two near term pipeline projects, an improved Majestene process and MBI-014/015. As we integrate Pro Farm, we also expect to direct our research and development activity to build an innovative seed treatment product line that combine our Pro Farm technology with our other technologies.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 45 full-time equivalent employees dedicated to research and development and patent related activities, 12 of whom hold Ph.D. degrees or doctorates, plus 8 field development personnel who focus on technical support and demonstration and research field trials. Our research and development team has technical expertise in microbiology, molecular biology, natural product, formulation and analytical chemistry, biochemistry, fermentation, entomology, nematology, weed science, plant physiology, plant pathology. Our research and development activities include discovery, product development, product support, regulatory, patent and field trial activities, which are principally conducted at our Davis, California facility as well as by our field development specialists on crops in their respective regions. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in research and development such as increasing the number and locations of field trials and toxicology and regulatory consultants for new products and international expansion, but our Davis research and development headcount has remained relatively flat since 2015. Our research and development expenses, including patent expenses, were $14.0 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to preserve our competitive position. As of December 31, 2019, we had 53 issued U.S. patents and 396 issued foreign patents 23 pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, and 105 pending foreign patent applications relating to microorganisms and natural product compounds, uses and related technologies. As of December 31, 2019, we have received 8 copyright registrations. As of December 31, 2019, we had received 22 U.S. trademark registrations and had 15 trademark applications pending in the United States. As of December 31, 2019, we also had received 153 trademark registrations and had 34 trademark applications pending in various other countries.

When we find a microbial product in our screen that kills or inhibits one or more pests or pathogens in at least three replicated tests and identify the microorganism and its associated chemistry, we file a patent application claiming any one or more of the following:
 

● | the microorganism, its DNA products, as well as mutations and other derivatives; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the use of the microorganism for pest management; 
● | novel natural product compounds, their analogs and unique mixtures of compounds produced by the microorganism; 
● | the new use of known natural product compounds for pest management; 
● | formulations of the microorganism or compounds; and 
● | synergistic mixtures of the microorganism or compounds with conventional chemical or other pesticides. 

 
One of our Marrone products and certain of our leading product candidates are based on microbes we have identified using our proprietary discovery process, including Venerate, Majestene/Zelto and MBI-014/015, which are based on a Burkholderia bacterium, with respect to which we have 56 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications (both U.S. and foreign), and MBI-110 and MBI-507, which are based on a Bacillus strain, with respect to which we have 28 issued patents and 4 pending patent applications (both U.S. and foreign). Our Pro Farm products are based on technology developed by Pro Farm scientists for producing organic molecular complexes that facilitate nutrient absorption, and are protected by 2 issued U.S. patents, one issued Canadian patent, and 17 pending patent applications (both U.S. and foreign) comprising issued method of use patents and pending applications for method of manufacture.
 
We have also entered into in-license and research and development agreements with respect to the use and commercialization of Grandevo and Haven, as well as certain products under development. Under the licensing arrangements for our commercially available products, we are obligated to pay royalty fees between 2% and 5% of net sales of these products, subject in certain cases to aggregate dollar caps. The exclusivity and royalty provisions of these agreements are generally tied to the expiration of underlying patents. We have filed separate patent applications with respect to both Regalia and Zequanox product lines and have been issued 6 U.S. patents with respect to Regalia and 6 for Zequanox. In addition, the in-licensed U.S. patent for Grandevo is expected to expire in or around 2024, but there are pending U.S. patent applications relating to Grandevo that could expire later than 2024, and we have also filed separate patent applications for Grandevo of which 9 have been issued on a novel compound and uses for nematodes, corn rootworm and a variety of insects.
 
While third parties thereafter may develop products using the technology under the expired patents, we do not believe that they can produce competitive products without infringing other aspects of our proprietary technology, and we therefore do not expect the expiration of the patents or the related exclusivity obligations to have a significant adverse financial or operational impact on our business.
 
Regulatory Considerations
 
Our activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations. These regulations may prevent us or our collaborators from developing or commercializing products in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions and may impose expenses, delays and other impediments to our product development and registration efforts. In the United States, the EPA regulates our bio-based pest management products under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). In addition, some of our plant health products are regulated as fertilizers, auxiliary plant substances, soil amendments, beneficial substances and/or biostimulants in each of the fifty states.
 
In 2004, the United States Congress passed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act, which was reauthorized in 2007 and 2012, a result of efforts from an industry coalition of pesticide companies and environmental groups, to codify pesticide approval times in return for user fees. This law facilitates faster approval times for biopesticides, with EPA approvals typically received within 16 to 24 months, compared with 36 months or longer for conventional chemical pesticides. Registration processes for state and foreign governments vary between jurisdictions and can take up to 12 months for state governments, such as California and New York, and up to 36 months or more for foreign governments. In some instances, California and Canada will conduct joint reviews with the EPA, which allows some pesticides to receive concurrent approvals in California, Canada and the United States. However, in most instances, most foreign government submissions will not occur until after a U.S. registration has been secured. To register a crop protection product with the EPA, companies must demonstrate the product is safe to mammals, non-target organisms, endangered species and the environment. To demonstrate the bio-based pest management product’s safety, required studies must be conducted that evaluate mammalian toxicology, toxicological effects to non-target organisms in the environment (ecotoxicological exposures) and physical and chemical properties of the product. The registration dossier is subject to both scientific and administrative reviews by EPA scientists and management before registration approval. The scientific review involves thorough evaluation of submitted data and completion of risk assessments for human dietary and ecotoxicological exposures. Upon completion of this process, the registration package, including the proposed label, is sent to the Office of General Council for legal review. The final step in the registration process is administrative sign-off by the EPA director of the Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division.

In addition to EPA approval, we are required to obtain regulatory approval from the appropriate state regulatory authority in individual states and foreign regulatory authorities before we can market or sell any pest management product in those jurisdictions. Foreign governments typically require up to two seasons of locally generated field efficacy data on crop-pest combinations before a product dossier can be submitted for review. California and foreign jurisdictions also require us to submit product efficacy data, which the EPA historically has not required, but may request.
 
We also generally pursue organic certification, including USDA National Organic Program, Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI), EcoCert and Control Union, for our product portfolio. These certifications often entail a two to four-month review process and, in many instances, require annual or semi-annual audits.
 
While these regulations substantially increase the time and cost associated with bringing our products to market, we believe that our management team’s significant experience in bringing our and other companies’ technologies through EPA, state and foreign regulatory approval, efficient development process and ability to leverage our strategic collaborations to assist with registrations, particularly in Europe and Latin America, have and will continue to enable us to overcome these challenges.
 
Around the globe, the regulatory process for biostimulants and bionutrients (biofertilizers) is significantly accelerated compared to that for biopesticides. In the United States, if plant health products are not used to control pests or do not act as plant (growth) regulators, they currently fall outside the legal scope of FIFRA, FFDCA and FQPA and, therefore, we do not need to submit applications for EPA registrations for such products. However, we must still submit state registrations for our plant health products, including Haven and our Pro Farm products. Products containing microbes of foreign origin may also need to be “deregulated” (or determined not to be a plant pest) under the Plant Protection Act by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service prior to use in field trials or for large scale release. Europe and the United States have industry coalitions that have developed more formal definitions of “biostimulant” and made recommendations for possible streamlined regulatory frameworks. The 2018 Farm Bill for the first time proposed a federal definition of biostimulants. As mandated by U. S. Congress in the 2018 Farm Bill, in December 2019, the Secretary of Agriculture submitted a study to Congress recommending options for the official definition and regulation of biostimulants in the United States. Joint federal, state and industry discussions are now underway to review those options and to recommend a suitable path forward and policy framework for the regulation of biostimulants in the United States.
 
All of our biopesticide product lines are EPA-approved. However, as with any pesticide, our pest management products will continue to be subject to review by the EPA and state regulatory agencies. The EPA has the authority to revoke the registration or impose limitations on the use of any of our pest management products if we do not comply with the regulatory requirements, if unexpected problems occur with a product or if the EPA receives other newly discovered adverse information. See Part I-Item 1A-“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Strategy—Our inability to obtain regulatory approvals, or to comply with ongoing and changing regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent sales of the products we are developing and commercializing.” Our research and development activities are also subject to federal, state and local worker safety, air pollution, water pollution and solid and hazardous waste regulatory programs and periodic inspection. We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulatory requirements.

Competition
 
For agricultural products, performance and value are critical competitive factors. To compete against manufacturers of conventional chemical pesticides, chemical fertilizers and genetically modified crops, we need to demonstrate the advantages of our products over these more established products. Many large agrichemical companies are developing, and have introduced, new conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified products that they believe are safer and more environmentally friendly than older conventional chemical products.
 
The pest management market is very competitive and is dominated by multinational chemical and life sciences companies such as Syngenta, Bayer, BASF, Corteva, UPL, FMC and Sumitomo Chemical. Universities, research institutes and government agencies may also conduct research, seek patent protection and, through collaborations, develop competitive pest management products. Other companies, including bio-specialized biopesticide businesses such as AgraQuest (owned by Bayer), Certis USA (owned by Mitsui & Co), Novozymes and Valent Biosciences (subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical) may prove to be significant competitors in the bio-based pest management and plant health market. In addition, we could face competition in the future from new, well-financed start-up companies such as AgBiome, Terramera and Vestaron.
 
In many instances, agrichemical companies have substantially greater financial, technical, development, distribution and sales and marketing resources than we do. Moreover, these companies may have greater name recognition than we do and may offer discounts as a competitive tactic. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing pest management products that are more effective or less expensive than ours or that would render our products obsolete or less competitive. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies and products.
 
Due to the lower regulatory barriers than for crop protection products, the market for bionutrition and biostimulant products is very fragmented, with hundreds if not thousands of companies globally, including larger players like Valagro and UPL (after Arysta acquisition) and Acadian Seaplants, well-financed startups such as Indigo, Bioconsortia, New Leaf Symbiotics and Pivot Bio, and numerous smaller companies, many of which may lack robust science and quality control.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 133 full-time equivalent employees, of whom 12 hold Ph.D. degrees or doctorates. Approximately 45 employees are engaged in research and development and patent related activities, 31 in sales and marketing (including 8 sales and field development personnel who focus on technical support and demonstration and research field trials), 37 in operations, including manufacturing, supply chain and quality assurance, and 20 in management, accounting/finance and administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
