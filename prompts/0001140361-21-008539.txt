Business Introduction/Summary
 
We were originally formed on October 8, 2014 as a blank check company under the name Jensyn Acquisition Corp. for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more businesses or entities. On June 20, 2019, we completed a business combination (the “Reverse Merger and Recapitalization”) pursuant to which we acquired Peck Electric Co. (“Peck Electric”). The Business Combination was a reverse merger treated as a recapitalization and that Peck Electric was deemed the accounting acquirer and takes over the historical information for the Company. Following the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we became known as The Peck Company Holdings, Inc. We conducted all of our business operations exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary, Peck Electric, until January 19, 2021.
 
On January 19, 2021, we completed a business combination (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which we acquired iSun Energy LLC (“iSun Energy, LLC”). The Business Combination was an acquisition treated as a merger and reorganization and that iSun Energy, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Peck Company Holdings, Inc. Following the Merger Agreement, we changed our name to iSun, Inc. (formerly The Peck Company Holdings, Inc,) We now conduct all of our business operations exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Peck Electric and iSun Energy, LLC.
 
We are one of the largest commercial solar engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) companies in the country and are expanding across the Northeastern United States. We were a second-generation family business founded under the name Peck Electric Co. in 1972 as a traditional electrical contractor. Our core values were and still are to align people, purpose, and profitability, and since taking leadership in 1994, Jeffrey Peck, our Chief Executive Officer, has applied such core values to expand into the solar industry. Today, we are guided by the mission to facilitate the reduction of carbon emissions through the expansion of clean, renewable energy and we believe that leveraging such core values to deploy resources toward profitable business is the only sustainable strategy to achieve these objectives.
 
The world recognizes the need to transition to a reliable, renewable energy grid in the next 50 years. Vermont and Hawaii are leading the way in the U.S. with renewable energy goals of 75% by 2032 and 100% by 2045, respectively. California committed to 100% carbon-free energy by 2045. The majority of the other states in the U.S. also have renewable energy goals, regardless of current Federal solar policy. We are a member of Renewable Energy Vermont, an organization that advocates for clean, practical and renewable solar energy. We intend to use near-term incentives to take advantage of long-term, sustainable energy transformation with a commitment to the environment and to our shareholders. Our triple bottom line, which is geared towards people, environment, and profit, has always been our guide since we began installing renewable energy and we intend that it remain our guide over the next 50 years as we construct our energy future.
 
We primarily provide EPC services to solar energy customers for projects ranging in size from several kilowatts for residential loads to multi-megawatt systems for large commercial and utility projects. To date, we have installed over 125 megawatts of solar systems since inception and are focused on profitable growth opportunities. We believe that we are well-positioned for what we believe to be the coming transformation to an all renewable energy economy. As a result of the completion of the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we have now opened our family company to the public market as part of our strategic growth plan. We are expanding across the Northeastern United States to serve the fast-growing demand for clean renewable energy. We are open to partnering with others to accelerate our growth process, and we are expanding our portfolio of company-owned solar arrays to establish recurring revenue streams for many years to come. We have established a leading presence in the market after five decades of successfully serving our customers, and we are now ready for new opportunities and the next five decades of success.
 
We manage our business through our construction operations and offer our EPC services and products consisting of solar, electrical and data installations. Approximately 80% of our revenue is derived from our solar EPC business, approximately 18% of revenue is derived from our electrical and data business and approximately 2% of revenue is currently derived from recurring revenue of Company-owned solar arrays. Recently our growth has been derived by increasing our solar customer base starting in 2013 and by continuing to serve the needs of existing electrical and data customers. We have installed some of the largest commercial and utility-scale solar arrays in the State of Vermont. Our union crews are expert constructors, and union access to an additional workforce makes us ready for rapid expansion to other states while maintaining control of operating costs. The skillset provided by our workforce is transferrable among our service offerings depending on current demand.
 
We also make investments in solar development projects and currently own approximately three megawatts of operating solar arrays operating under long-term power purchase agreements. These long-term recurring revenue streams, combined with our in-house development and construction capabilities, make this asset class a strategic long-term investment opportunity for us.
 
We have a three-pronged growth strategy that includes (1) organic expansion across the Northeastern United States, (2) conducting accretive merger and acquisition transactions to expand geographically, and (3) investing into Company-owned solar assets.

Consummation of the Business Combinations
 
On January 19, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Peck Mercury, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”), iSun Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“iSun Energy, LLC”), the sole member of which was Sassoon M. Peress (“Peress”), and Peress, pursuant to which the Merger Sub merged with and into iSun Energy LLC (the “Merger”) with iSun Energy LLC as the surviving company in the Merger and iSun Energy LLC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with Merger, Peress will receive 400,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock over five years, 200,000 shares of which were issued at the closing, warrants to purchase up 200,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, and up to 240,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock based on certain performance milestones.
 
iSun Energy LLC offers products and services designed to support the growing electric vehicle and smart city markets. The flagship iSun Energy & Mobility Hub is the result of 30 years of passion, dedication, and innovation through sustainability. The iSun solar EV carport charging systems incorporate solar panels to charge electric vehicles while providing unparalleled software insights into data surrounding the energy produced, consumed, air quality effects and other key metrics. The iSun Oasis Smart Solar Bench is expected to be an integral part in developing smart cities and campuses and has the ability to charge any mobile device through integrated solar panels that collect and store energy throughout the day. iSun’s accompanying data platform allows for monitoring and analysis of key metrics through built in IoT (Internet of Things) sensors. The platform also affords both physical and digital advertising and branding, for additional recurring revenue opportunities. iSun’s Augmented Reality 3D software platform helps clients visualize their projects before they are built, making it easy for our clients to adopt sustainable solutions and to understand their impact on sustainability.
 
As disclosed on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 26, 2019, on June 20, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the Company consummated the previously announced business combination (the “Reverse Merger and Recapitalization”) following a Special Meeting of its Stockholders held on June 19, 2019 (the “Special Meeting”), where the stockholders of the Company considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt that certain Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of February 26, 2019 (the “Exchange Agreement”), by and among Jensyn, Peck Electric Co., a Vermont corporation (“Peck Electric”), and Peck Electric’s stockholders (the “Stockholders”). “Jensyn” refers to the Company prior to the closing of the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization (the “Closing”). In connection with the Closing and pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, among other things, the Company changed its name from “Jensyn Acquisition Corp.” to “The Peck Company Holdings, Inc.”
 
In connection with the Closing, Jensyn issued 3,234,501 shares of Jensyn’s Common Stock to the Stockholders in exchange for all of the equity securities of Peck Electric, and Peck Electric became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The Company redeemed a total of 492,037 shares of its Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation resulting in a total payment to redeeming stockholders of $5,510,814.
 
In connection with the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, the Company issued 493,299 shares of Common Stock in exchange for the cancellation of approximately $5,618,675 of obligations and, as contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, certain insiders and their transferees  agreed to forfeit and cancel 281,758 shares of Common Stock.

Prior to the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we have ceased to be a “shell company” and have continued the existing business operations of the Company as a publicly traded company under the name “iSun, Inc.” (formerly The Peck Company Holdings, Inc.). The business combination was a reverse merger treated as a recapitalization and that, Peck Electric was deemed the accounting acquirer and took over the historical information for the Company.
 
Market Overview
 
We believe that a global energy transformation is occurring now as the world shifts from fossil fuels to clean renewable energy. Technology is available with proven reliability and low enough cost to allow widespread adoption. Bloomberg New Energy Finance is a leading provider of primary research on clean energy, advanced transport, digital industry, innovative materials, and commodities. Their annual summit in New York in March 2019 included many discussions by leaders that corroborate the long-term growth opportunities around the clean energy transformation well underway now and through 2050.
 
The solar industry is positioned for rapid growth. More than 80% of Peck Electric’s revenue mix is from solar array installations. Industry reports forecast a sharp acceleration in solar installations through 2050, and the US Energy Information Association noted in its 2019 outlook that it expects solar energy production to reach 48% of the overall mix of renewable energy production by 2050, from just 13% in 2018. The drivers of this acceleration include the declining cost of solar array equipment, a heightened focus on clean renewable energy production, and the consistent increase in demand of electric energy. We are uniquely positioned to benefit from this rapid escalation in solar array installations, given our 47-year history as a full service electric contractor and our existing, highly scalable and historically profitable solar installation business in Vermont.
 

7
 
Strategically positioned geographically in the Northeastern United States. We have historically operated exclusively in Vermont, which is one of the most attractive states for investment in solar arrays, with industry analysis suggesting over a 14% internal rate of return (“IRR”) on solar investment in the state and an 8-year project payback. Almost the entirety of the Northeast region of the country is ranked in the top 10 markets based on return metrics to the array owner, including the top 3 markets which include Massachusetts (1), New Jersey (2), and Rhode Island (3), in addition to New York, which is the largest regional market and ranked 8th. By leveraging our existing infrastructure and labor relationships with the IBEW, we are uniquely positioned to expand into these important addressable markets with limited investment in additional infrastructure or capital equipment.
 
Our capabilities allow for expansion into high-growth adjacent markets. We hold a rich history as a business in operation in Vermont for 47 years. We began operations as a traditional electric contractor and hold a wide range of capabilities to install electric equipment for a variety of end uses. Today, these core capabilities have developed our business in solar array installation, traditional electric, and data services. We can deploy these capabilities to other large, rapidly growing clean/renewable end markets; namely electric vehicle (“EV”) charging stations and energy storage. The rapid proliferation of EV charging stations has followed the shift in auto sales to electronic vehicles, and the EV charging market is expected to expand to over $30 billion by 2024 with a CAGR of 40% over the 5-year period. Energy storage measured by megawatts expanded by 44% year-over-year in 2018 and is projected to grow into a $4.7 billion market by 2024. Both of these markets represent adjacent, high growth expansion opportunities for us, and both require minimal investment of resources, infrastructure or capital spend given its complementary nature to our existing capabilities.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategic areas for growth include (1) organic growth by leveraging existing relationships to expand across the Northeast (2) accretive mergers and acquisitions of profitable businesses to expand geographic footprint, capabilities, and cash flow, and (3) investment into solar arrays that produce a steady stream of recurring revenue.
 
Organic growth from our existing customers will come from national developers requesting EPC services for project sizes ranging from the residential to the utility scale. The ideal project size range for us is from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts, which is considered commercial to small utility and is where the scale, margin, and risk are optimized. In addition, we can remain opportunistic for smaller residential projects when marketing costs are minimized or for larger utility projects when margins can be preserved.
 
Accretive mergers and acquisitions activity is an important focus for us in order to accelerate revenue growth and cash flow. While geographic expansion is prioritized for the Northeastern United States, prudent acquisitions in other geographies will also be considered depending on the strategic fit and profitability characteristics.
 
The goal of solar array asset investments is long-term recurring revenue from the sale of power produced by the array asset. Our EPC capabilities provide the Company with a unique investment opportunity in the renewable energy space because we can enter the solar array value chain at any scale or stage. De-risked fully-operational solar arrays with reliable off-takers can be purchased by and operated by us. We believe that, at this end-stage, an IRR may be achieved in the range of 9% to 13%. However, higher returns of up to 20% IRR may be achieved with prudent investments in developed projects with permitting and off-takers that only require construction by the EPC. Further, returns of 20% IRR or more may be achieved if we develop a project internally with a low-risk, long-term off-taker. We believe we have the flexibility and capability to be opportunistic about prudent solar array asset investments at any stage.

Employees
 
As of March 12, 2021, we employed approximately 150 full-time employees. We may also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with installing solar systems for our commercial and residential customers. Our direct installation labor is a combination of employees and contract labor.
 
We have direct access to unionized labor, which provides a unique advantage for growth, because workforce resources can be scaled efficiently utilizing local labor unions in other states to meet specific project needs in other states without increasing fixed labor costs for us.
 
Financing
 
To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing options. Our objective is to arrange the most flexible terms that meet the needs and wants of the customer. Although we do not directly provide financing, we have relationships to arrange financing with numerous private and public sources, including the Vermont State Employees Credit Union, which offers VGreen financing to maximize solar investment savings.
 
We believe it is best for customers to own their own systems, but some customers prefer not to own their systems. We also have the ability to arrange financing with third parties through power purchase agreements and leases for our customers.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase solar panels, inverters and materials directly from multiple manufacturers and through distributors. We intend to further coordinate purchases and optimize supply relationships to realize the advantages of greater scale.
 
If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our supply needs, ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and our management believes that we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a number of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.
 
We also utilize strategic companies with subcontractors for electrical installations, for racking and solar panel installations, as well as numerous subcontractors for grading, landscaping, and construction for our commercial, and industrial customers.
 
Installation
 
We are a licensed contractor in the markets that we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simple and seamless for its customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.
 
Even with controlling every aspect of the installation process, the ability to perform on a contract is subject to limitations. There remain jurisdictional approval processes outside our immediate control including, but not limited to, approvals of city, county, state or Federal government bodies or one of their respective agencies. Other aspects outside of our direct control include approvals from various utility companies and weather conditions.
 
After-Sales Support
 
It is our intent to provide continuing operation and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial solar systems. We provide extended factory equipment technical support and act as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology, and solar electric energy engineering staff. We do this through a 5-year limited workmanship warranty and operations and maintenance program, which among other things, provides a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours and offer assistance as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. Our price to customers includes this warranty, and also includes the pass through of various manufacturers’ warranties that are typically up to 25 years.

Customers
 
Currently, the majority of our revenue comes from commercial and small utility solar installations ranging in size from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts. We have experience that this size of project optimizes margin scale, and risk. Opportunistically, we also install residential scale projects (8 kilowatts to 20 kilowatts) when marketing costs are minimal or not required. Large utility scale projects over 10 megawatts can also be opportunistically selected when margins can be preserved.
 
Approximately 83% of our sales in 2020 were in commercial and small utility solar projects. Approximately 0.5% of revenues were generated by residential installations in 2020. In 2019, approximately 77% of our sales were in commercial and small utility solar projects, while approximately 3% of revenues came from residential solar. We expect that these percentages will vary from year to year.
 
We believe that we have an advantage in the commercial solar market in Vermont given our extensive contact list, resulting from our experience in the commercial and industrial construction market, which also provides access to customers that trust us. Through our network of vendors, participation in variety of industry trade associations and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.
 
Competitors
 
In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to our products. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience, and technical capabilities than we do. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that we are the dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all the areas in which we currently operate. We compete with other solar installers on our expertise and proven track record of performance. Also, pricing, service and the ability to arrange financing may be important for a project award.
Seasonality
 
We often find that some customers tend to book projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. This results in third and fourth quarter sales being more robust usually at the expense of the first quarter. In the future, this seasonality may cause fluctuations in financial results. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change. Weather can also be an important factor affecting project timelines.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Generally, the solar EPC business is not dependent on intellectual property.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conducts business.
 
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility and we and/or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of OSHA, the DOT and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 

10
 
Government Incentives
 
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable Peck Electric to lower the price it charges customers to own or lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
 
The federal government currently offers a 26% investment tax credit (“ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2022, after which it will fall to 22% in 2023 and 10% in 2024.
 
The economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
 
Approximately 50% of states in the U.S. offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, these states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a solar energy system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the State from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date.
