 Item 1. Business    Overview
 We are a Houston, Texas based independent oil and natural gas company, with regional offices in Oklahoma City and Stillwater, Oklahoma. Our business is to maximize production and cash flow from our offshore properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”) and onshore Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wyoming properties and use that cash flow to explore, develop, exploit and acquire oil and natural gas properties across the United States. We were originally formed in 1999 as a Nevada corporation and changed our state of incorporation to the State of Delaware in 2000. On June 14, 2019, following approval by our stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Texas.
 In December 2019, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Juneau Oil & Gas, LLC (“Juneau”), which provides us the right to acquire an interest in up to six of Juneau’s exploratory prospects located in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.
     In September 2019, we entered into unrelated purchase agreements with Will Energy Corporation (“Will Energy”) and White Star Petroleum, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “White Star”) to purchase certain producing assets and undeveloped acreage, primarily in Oklahoma. These transactions closed during the three months ended December 31, 2019. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information. 
 The following table lists our primary producing areas as of December 31, 2019: 

Location | Formation 
Gulf of Mexico | Offshore Louisiana - water depths less than 300 feet 
Mid-continent Region of Oklahoma | Mississippian, Woodford, Oswego, Cottage Grove, Chester and Red Fork
Southern Delaware Basin, Pecos County, Texas | Wolfcamp A and B 
Madison and Grimes counties, Texas | Woodbine / Upper Lewisville 
Zavala and Dimmit counties, Texas | Buda / Eagle Ford / Georgetown 
San Augustine County, Texas | Haynesville shale, Mid Bossier shale and James Lime 
Other Texas Gulf Coast | Conventional and smaller unconventional formations 
Weston County, Wyoming | Muddy Sandstone 
Sublette County, Wyoming | Jonah Field (1)

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      From our initial entry into the Southern Delaware Basin in 2016 and through early 2019, we focused on the development of our initial 6,500 net acre position in Pecos County, Texas (“Bullseye”), and in December 2018, we purchased an additional 4,200 gross operated (1,700 net) acres and 4,000 gross non-operated (200 net) acres to the northeast of our Bullseye acreage (“NE Bullseye”) for approximately $7.5 million. We paid $3.2 million cash in December 2018, with the remaining cash balance paid in installments in March and October of 2019. Our 2019 drilling program included the completion of one well previously drilled in the Bullseye area, the drilling and completion of a second Bullseye well, and the drilling and completion of three wells in the NE Bullseye area. As of December 31, 2019, we were producing from seventeen wells over our approximate 18,600 gross (8,000 net) acre position in West Texas, prospective for the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Second Bone Spring formations. In December 2019, we began completion operations on the fourth NE Bullseye well, which began producing in January 2020. Also in December 2019, we completed and brought on production a Garfield County, Oklahoma well in our Central Oklahoma region, which we acquired in connection with the White Star acquisition. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.  
     In response to low commodity prices and a related window of opportunity to acquire producing properties on very attractive terms, we finished our 2019 drilling program, which was designed to only preserve core areas of our West Texas play, and thereafter focused on identifying, evaluating and acquiring producing reserves. As a result, we were successful in closing the Will Energy and White Star acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2020, we believe that 

 
  1
 
a continuing low price environment and a shortage of capital available to the industry may present more opportunities to acquire additional producing properties that could provide strong production, cash flow and future development potential at attractive rates of return. We plan to be active in pursuing such acquisition opportunities and then allowing our technical teams to leverage our experience and expertise to work on increasing returns through production enhancement, cost reduction and future development of the unproved drilling locations that come with the production acquired. We can provide no assurances that we will acquire any producing property opportunities on attractive terms, or at all, or that we will realize the expected benefits of any acquisition. We currently plan to limit our 2020 drilling program to only address leasehold commitments and preserve core acreage in our existing areas, while complementing that strategy with one to two relatively low cost, high-potential offshore exploratory wells on prospects recently acquired from Juneau. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information. We will continue to make balance sheet strength a priority in 2020 as we utilize excess cash flow to reduce debt and increase our capacity to quickly react to acquisition opportunities. 
     We are also currently undertaking an extensive review of all of our producing areas in light of the commodity price environment, and where determined justified and operationally feasible, we plan to potentially shut in or curtail unhedged production. Because of our low debt profile and borrowing cost of capital, we believe we may be able to temporarily shut in or curtail higher cost production when there is a decline in the commodity markets. We are also currently re-evaluating the economic justification for proceeding with the production-enhancing workover program originally scheduled for the first half of 2020. The limited onshore development drilling we planned for 2020 is also being re-evaluated.  
    
As we focus on the above stated initiatives, we also continue to sell non-core assets to improve overall margins, to provide incremental liquidity, to reduce future asset retirement obligations and to improve our balance sheet. During the year ended 2018, we sold certain Eagle Ford Shale assets in Karnes County, Texas for $21.0 million; Gulf Coast conventional assets in Southeast Texas for $6.0 million, and Gulf Coast conventional and unconventional assets in South Texas for $0.9 million. In December 2018, we also sold our offshore Vermilion 170 property in exchange for a retained overriding royalty interest (“ORRI”) in the well, the buyer’s assumption of the plugging and abandonment obligation and an ORRI in any future wells drilled by the buyer on two nearby prospects that would produce through this platform. During the year ended 2019, we sold minor, non-core operated assets located in Lavaca and Wharton counties, Texas and Frio and Zavala counties, Texas, both of which sales were in exchange for the buyers’ assumption of the plugging and abandonment liabilities of the properties. We recorded a gain of $0.6 million after removal of the asset retirement obligations associated with these properties sold in 2019.
     In November 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 8,596,068 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $33.0 million, which were used to reduce borrowings under our former credit facility, fund the initial purchase of the NE Bullseye acreage and provide funding for our 2019 capital expenditure program.
     In September 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “September Public Offering”) of 51,447,368 shares of common stock (of which 5,524,498 were reissued treasury shares) for net proceeds of approximately $46.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and fees and expenses. Net proceeds from the September Public Offering and concurrent Series A Private Placement (as defined below) were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the Will Energy acquisition and to reduce borrowings under our former revolving credit facility.
     In conjunction with the September Public Offering, we also entered into a purchase agreement with affiliates of John C. Goff, a director and significant shareholder, and current chairman, of the Company, to issue and sell in a private placement (the “Series A Private Placement”) 789,474 shares of Series A contingent convertible preferred stock, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $7.5 million. 
     In November 2019, we completed a private placement of 1,102,838 shares of Series B contingent convertible preferred stock, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $21.0 million (the “Series B Private Placement”). Net proceeds from the Series B Private Placement were used to fund a portion of the purchase price and related transaction expenses for the White Star acquisition. 
     In the fourth quarter of 2019, we obtained approval from the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company’s capital stock to increase the number of common shares authorized for issuance from 100 million to 200 million common shares, at which time the Series A preferred shares automatically converted into 7,894,740 shares of 

 
  2
 
common stock, the Series B preferred shares automatically converted into 11,028,380 shares of common stock, and the outstanding preferred shares were cancelled.         In December 2019, we also completed a private placement offering (the “December Offering”) of 19,000,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $45.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and fees and expenses. In conjunction with the December Offering, we also completed a private placement of 2,340,000 shares of Series C contingent convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Private Placement”) with affiliates of Mr. Goff, Mr. Wilkie S. Colyer, Jr., our chief executive officer, and others, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $5.6 million. An additional 360,000 Series C contingent convertible preferred shares were issued in a private placement to the placement agents for the December Offering and Series C Private Placement, as partial consideration for their services. Net proceeds from the December Offering and Series C Private Placement will be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures under our Joint Development Agreement with Juneau. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information.
     The Series C preferred shares are a new class of equity security that ranks equal to the common shares with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. The Series C preferred shares have no voting rights. Upon approval by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Company’s capital stock, each Series C preferred share will convert into one common share and, upon conversion, the outstanding Series C preferred shares will be cancelled.
 Our production for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 17.9 Bcfe (or 49.2 Mmcfe/d) and was composed of 41% from our offshore properties and 53% natural gas. Our production for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 8.7 Bcfe (or 94.2 Mmcfe/d), with 20% from our offshore properties and 48% natural gas. The production rates for the fourth quarter include November and December 2019 production from the acquired White Star and Will Energy properties in the Western Anadarko, Central Oklahoma and Other Onshore regions. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information. 
 As of December 31, 2019, our proved reserves, as estimated by William M. Cobb and Associates (“Cobb”), our independent petroleum engineering firm, in accordance with reserve reporting guidelines required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), were approximately 316.4 Bcfe, consisting of 131.3 Bcf of natural gas, 19.1 MMBbl of oil and condensate and 11.8 MMBbl of natural gas liquids (“NGLs”). As of December 31, 2019, our proved reserves were approximately 77% proved developed (volumetrically), approximately 89% of total volumes onshore and approximately 94% of total volumes attributed to wells and properties operated by us. 
 As of December 31, 2019, our proved reserves had a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”) of $257.8 million and a present value, discounted at a 10% rate based on year-end SEC pricing guidelines (PV‑10), of $286.6 million. PV-10 as of December 31, 2019 was based on SEC prices of $55.69 per barrel of oil and $2.52 per Mmbtu of natural gas. Resulting realized prices, after adjustments and differentials across all assets, were $2.17 per MMbtu of natural gas, $53.98 per barrel of oil and $16.95 per barrel of NGLs. As of December 31, 2019, our proved reserves were approximately 92% of total PV-10 proved developed, approximately 85% of total PV-10 onshore and approximately 93% of total PV-10 attributed to wells and properties operated by us. PV-10 is not an accounting principle generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and is therefore classified as a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of our Standardized Measure to PV‑10 is provided under “Item 2. Properties ‑ PV-10”.

      Our Strategy
     Our long-term business strategy is: 
     • Pursuing accretive, opportunistic acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial objectives. We believe that there is currently a window of opportunity for us to acquire PDP-heavy assets that also possess sizable undeveloped acreage positions from distressed and/or motivated sellers at an attractive discount to PDP PV-10 valuations. Consequently, we currently intend to focus our growth efforts on identifying, evaluating and pursuing the acquisition of such oil and natural gas properties in areas where we currently have a presence and/or specific operating expertise that will position us to enhance our expected acquisition returns through leveraging our operational experience and expertise in order to provide productivity and cost improvements, and where appropriate, increase reserves through development drilling. We may acquire individual properties or private or publicly traded companies, in each case for cash, common stock, preferred stock or a combination thereof. We believe that the ongoing low commodity price environment, and very limited sources of debt and/or equity capital available to our industry, should provide significant reserve and cash flow growth opportunity for us through potential corporate combinations that provide an attractive mix of significant cash flow and undeveloped growth potential.
     • Enhancing our existing portfolio by dedicating the majority of our drilling capital to our existing portfolio of oil and liquids-rich opportunities. A key element of our long term strategy is to continue to develop the oil and natural gas liquids resource potential that we believe exists in numerous formations within our various oil/liquids weighted resource plays, and where possible, to expand our presence in those plays. Due to the current superior economics of oil production, as compared to natural gas, we expect to focus on oil and liquids-weighted opportunities as we strive to transition from a heavily weighted natural gas production profile to a more balanced reserve and production profile between oil/liquids and natural gas. In response to the low commodity price environment, and the current opportunity to be an asset consolidator in the industry, we plan to limit near-term drilling capital for the foreseeable future to that necessary to fulfill leasehold commitments, preserve core acreage, and where the opportunity exists, to drill where we can add production and cash flow at attractive rates of return. We will, however, continue to evaluate high quality drilling opportunities that have the potential to add significant reserves and cash flow to our portfolio at low finding and development cost, thereby providing returns superior to those generated in the currently active unconventional resource plays.  
     • 2020 business strategy. During 2020, we intend to continue to minimize our drilling program and pursue growth through the acquisition of PDP-heavy assets, and use excess cash flow for the reduction in borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. We plan to complement that conservative drilling program on our core onshore 

 
  4
 
resource plays with one to two relatively low cost, but high potential, exploratory tests of prospects that we acquired from Juneau in December of 2019. We will also be keenly focused on reducing lease operating costs and general and administrative expenses, and improving cash margins and lowering our exposure to asset retirement obligations through the possible sale of additional non-core properties. We will continue to make balance sheet strength a priority in 2020 and will continue to evaluate certain acquisition opportunities that may arise in this low price environment. We retain the flexibility to be more aggressive in our drilling plans should planned results exceed expectations, should commodity prices improve, and/or we continue to show progress in reducing our drilling and completion costs, thereby making an expansion of our drilling program an appropriate business decision. Our 2020 capital expenditure budget is currently estimated at approximately $13.1 million and is expected to include the following: 
    
· | Offshore GOM: the Iron Flea prospect in the Grand Isle Block 45/46 area in the shallow waters off of the Louisiana coast will require $6.3 million to drill and $0.8 million to abandon in the case of dry hole. We expect that capital expenditures will exceed this amount if the prospect is a success due to evaluation and completions costs and the possibility of a second well and /or facilities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | West Texas: $3.3 million to drill and complete one salt water disposal well and $0.4 million for infrastructure costs in our NE Bullseye area.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Central Oklahoma: $2.3 million to complete three previously drilled wells, which we acquired from White Star. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may revise our 2020 capital expenditure budget if deemed appropriate in light of changes in commodity prices or economic conditions.
     Properties
 Offshore Gulf of Mexico 
 As of December 31, 2019, our offshore assets consisted of five producing federal and two producing state of Louisiana company-operated wells in the shallow waters of the GOM. The following summary table sets forth certain information with respect to our offshore reserves as of December 31, 2019 and average daily offshore production for the year ended December 31, 2019:
 | | | | | | | | | | Average Daily
 | Estimated Proved | % Oil / | | % Natural | | % Natural Gas | | % Proved | | Production 
Field | Reserves (Bcfe) | Condensate | | Gas | | Liquids | | Developed | | (Mmcfe/d) 
Dutch and Mary Rose | 34.5 | 3 | % | 80 | % | 17 | % | 100 | % | 20.3 
Total | 34.5 | | | | | | | | | 20.3 

      Dutch and Mary Rose Field
     We currently operate five producing wells located in federal waters at Eugene Island 10 (“Dutch”), and two producing wells located in adjacent Louisiana state waters (“Mary Rose”). We plugged and abandoned the Mary Rose #4 well in 2018 and the Mary Rose #5 well in 2019. We plan to plug the Mary Rose #3 well in 2020. All Dutch and Mary Rose wells flow to a Company-owned and operated production platform at Eugene Island 11. While we do not own the lease for the Eugene Island 11 block, this does not impact our ability to operate our facilities located on that block. Operators in the GOM may place platforms and facilities on any location without having to own the lease, provided that permission and proper permits from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) have been obtained. We have obtained such permission and permits. We installed our facilities at Eugene Island 11 because that was the optimal gathering location in proximity to our wells and marketing pipelines.        From our production platform we are able to access two separate oil and natural gas markets thereby minimizing downtime risk and providing the ability to select the best sales price for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas production can flow through our 20” gas pipeline to third-party owned and operated onshore processing facilities near Patterson, Louisiana. Alternatively, natural gas can flow via our 8” pipeline to a third-party owned and operated onshore processing facility southwest of Abbeville, Louisiana, and oil can flow via a 6” oil pipeline to third-party owned and operated onshore processing facilities in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. Production facilities

include a turbine type compressor capable of servicing all Dutch and Mary Rose wells at the Eugene Island 11 platform. Condensate can also flow to onshore markets and multiple refineries. 
 Grand Isle Block 45/46 Area
 In December 2019, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Juneau, that provides the Company the right to acquire an interest in up to six of Juneau’s prospects located in the Gulf of Mexico. The first such prospect acquired by the Company is the Iron Flea prospect located in the Grand Isle Block 45 Area in the shallow waters off of the Louisiana coastline. Management considers this exploratory prospect to be an excellent complement to its PDP oriented acquisition strategy and believes it could provide a compelling economic value proposition, even in the current low oil price environment. See Note 4 – “Acquisitions and Dispositions” for more information. We anticipate spudding this prospect in the second quarter of 2020, and if successful, expect that the well could be producing in early 2021.      Vermilion 170 Field
     For most of 2018, we owned and operated one well located in federal waters off of the Louisiana coast with a dedicated production facility at Vermilion 170. Effective December 1, 2018, this well was sold to a third-party independent oil and gas company in exchange for the buyer’s assumption of the plugging and abandonment liability for the Vermilion 170 well, platform and associated pipeline, a retained ORRI in the Vermilion 170 well and an ORRI in any future wells drilled by the buyer on two nearby prospects that would produce through the Vermilion 170 platform if successful.     Central Oklahoma
 During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we acquired producing properties in the Will Energy and White Star acquisitions that are located in the Central Oklahoma region and are primarily in the Woodford, Meramec, Mississippian, Chester, Oswego and Hunton formations. In December 2019, we completed and brought on production a Garfield County, Oklahoma well, which we acquired in connection with the White Star acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, the Central Oklahoma region included approximately 743,800 gross (286,700 net) acres, proved reserves of 133.5 Bcfe (58% oil/liquids) and 778 gross (449.6 net) producing wells. Western Anadarko
 During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we acquired producing properties in the Will Energy and White Star acquisitions that are located in the Western Anadarko region and are primarily in the Chester, Tonkawa, Morrow, Marmaton, Cottage Grove, Red Fork and Cleveland formations. As of December 31, 2019, the Western Anadarko region included approximately 303,200 gross (167,200 net) acres, proved reserves of 47.1 Bcfe (61% gas) and 592 gross (348.7 net) producing wells. West Texas
 Southern Delaware Basin

Since July 2016, we and our 50% working interest partner in the Southern Delaware Basin have increased our leasehold footprint from approximately 5,000 undeveloped acres, net to Contango, to approximately 8,000 acres, net to Contango. As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that we have proved reserves of 43.3 Bcfe (75% oil, 90% total liquids) in our West Texas region. We believe substantially all of the potential drilling locations on this acreage can accommodate 10,000 foot laterals. 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we brought three wells online in the Southern Delaware Basin, the Iron Snake #1H, the Breakthrough State #1 H and the Old Ironside #1H, all of which are located in NE Bullseye. In January 2020, we brought one additional NE Bullseye well online, the State Spearhead #1H. NE Bullseye is expected to be a more productive and higher oil cut area that our Bullseye area and will be the focus of future capital spending in the area when we decide to become more aggressive in allocating capital to our drilling program.
    
 
  6
 


As of December 31, 2019, we had twelve wells producing from the Wolfcamp A, five wells producing from the Wolfcamp B, and a sixth well drilled in the Wolfcamp A which was completed in January 2020. Our West Texas production during the three months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 8.3 Mmcfe per day.
 Other Onshore 

Our Other Onshore region is comprised of various smaller non-core producing areas in Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming and Mississippi. Our estimated net proved reserves for the properties in this region are 58.0 Bcfe.    Texas
 Our Southeast Texas area includes approximately 19,500 gross (11,700 net) acres in Madison and Grimes counties, with a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations encompassing the Woodbine, Eagle Ford Shale and/or Georgetown/Buda formations. We had proved reserves of 42.7 Bcfe (87% oil/liquids) and 49 gross (29.2 net) producing wells in Southeast Texas as of December 31, 2019. 
 Our South Texas area includes properties in the Dimmitt and Zavala counties part of this area, which we believe approximately 16,100 gross (6,600 net) acres of to be prospective for the Buda, Georgetown and Eagle Ford Shale plays. Our South Texas area also includes approximately 17,500 gross (8,400 net) acres located in conventional fields that produce primarily from the Wilcox, Frio, and Vicksburg sands. Our estimated net proved reserves in this area were 5.9 Bcfe (54% gas) with 51 gross (23.2 net) producing wells, as of December 31, 2019. 
 Our East Texas area included approximately 5,900 gross (3,600 net) acres primarily in San Augustine County, with proved reserves of 0.9 Bcfe (84% gas) and 8 gross (4.7 net) producing wells. We believe that the further exploitation of our acreage in the Haynesville, Mid-Bossier and James Lime formations may provide long-term natural gas reserve and production growth potential in the future. There has been renewed interest in this area by offset operators as they experiment with new frac techniques and refracing of previously drilled wells.
 No drilling capital has been allocated to these Texas areas since 2015 due to the low commodity price environment and our focus on our West Texas region properties, with the exception of four successful non-operated Georgetown wells in which we participated in drilling from 2017 through 2019. 
     In 2018, we commenced a program to rationalize our minor, non-core assets located in South and Southeast Texas. We sold Eagle Ford Shale assets in Karnes County, Texas for $21.0 million; Gulf Coast conventional assets in Southeast Texas for $6.0 million, and Gulf Coast conventional and unconventional assets in South Texas for $0.9 million. In 2019, we sold certain non-core operated assets located in Lavaca and Wharton counties, Texas and Frio and Zavala counties, Texas, respectively, in exchange for the buyers’ assumption of the plugging and abandonment liabilities of the sold properties. In addition to the cash proceeds received for the divestitures noted, we also were successful in reducing our responsibility for asset retirement obligations by a total of $0.8 million and $8.6 million (undiscounted net) in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 Louisiana
 As of December 31, 2019, the estimated proved reserves for our Louisiana properties were 6.7 Bcfe (40% oil) primarily related to the properties we acquired in the Will Energy acquisition.  Wyoming 
 In 2015, we drilled the first of three successful wells in this area targeting the Muddy Sandstone formation. As a result of drilling these wells, we have satisfied the right to earn 35,000 net acres, of which approximately 27,800 net acres we still control. However, approximately 70% of such acreage will expire within the next three years if no drilling activity is conducted. Based on prior drilling results, a sustained improvement in oil prices will be needed to justify allocation of drilling capital to this area at the expense of other areas in our portfolio that provide higher returns. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated proved reserves for this area were 1.7 Bcfe (100% oil).

 Mississippi
 As of December 31, 2019, we held approximately 1,300 gross (300 net) mostly undeveloped acres in Mississippi.
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 We recognized $117.8 million in non-cash impairment charges of proved properties due to reserve revisions during the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in that impairment charge was $34.5 million related to our proved offshore Gulf of Mexico properties, primarily a result of a reassessment of future operating costs and a revision to the reservoir decline model for the expected decline in recoverable condensate volumes. In addition, we recognized onshore proved property impairment expense of $83.3 million, including $73.7 million in the Bullseye area in our West Texas region and $9.6 million in our Other Onshore region. The onshore impairment was primarily due to performance revisions and changes in realizable prices on the producing properties, which impacted the expected economics for proved undeveloped locations in these areas, which then resulted in the elimination of certain proved undeveloped locations due to the SEC’s five year development rule for such locations. 
 Under US GAAP, an impairment charge is required when the unamortized capital cost of a field within the Company’s proved property base exceeds the risked estimated future net cash flows from the proved, probable and possible reserves for that field. In 2019, we recognized non-cash unproved impairment expense of approximately $9.2 million related primarily to lease expirations, and near-term expirations, in the Bullseye area of our West Texas region.
 If oil or natural gas prices continue to decline further from those prices in effect at December 31, 2019, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment in the future, thereby impacting our financial results for that period.

 Jonah Field – Sublette County, Wyoming
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Contaro Company (“Contaro”), owns a 37% ownership interest in Exaro. As of December 31, 2019, we had invested approximately $46.9 million in Exaro, with no requirement to make any additional equity contributions, as our commitment to invest additional capital in Exaro expired on March 31, 2017. We account for Contaro’s ownership in Exaro using the equity method of accounting, and therefore, do not include its share of individual operating results, reserves or production in those reported in our consolidated results.
 As of December 31, 2019, Exaro had 648 wells on production over its 5,760 gross acres (1,040 net acres), with a working interest between 14.6% and 32.5%. These wells were producing at a rate of approximately 18 Mmcfe/d, net to Contango. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a net investment gain of approximately $1.0 million, net of zero tax expense, as a result of its equity investment in Exaro. As of December 31, 2019, reserves attributable to our investment in Exaro were 23.0 Bcfe. See Note 11 - “Investment in Exaro Energy III LLC” for additional details related to this equity investment. 
 Title to Properties
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings relating to claims associated with ownership interests in our properties. We believe we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, and liens for current taxes and other burdens, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Detailed investigations, including a title opinion rendered by a licensed independent third party attorney, are typically made before commencement of drilling operations.
 We have granted mortgage liens on substantially all of our natural gas and oil properties to secure our Credit Agreement. These mortgages and the related Credit Agreement contain substantial restrictions and operating covenants that are customarily found in credit agreements of this type. See Note 13 to our Financial Statements ‑ “Long-Term Debt” for further information.

 Marketing and Pricing
    
We derive our revenue principally from the sale of natural gas and oil. As a result, our revenues are determined, to a large degree, by prevailing natural gas and oil prices. We sell a portion of our natural gas production to purchasers pursuant to sales agreements which contain a primary term of up to three years and oil and condensate production to purchasers under sales agreements with primary terms of up to one year. The sales prices for natural gas are tied to industry standard published index prices, subject to negotiated price adjustments, while the sale prices for oil are tied to industry standard posted prices, subject to negotiated price adjustments.
     We typically utilize commodity price hedge instruments to minimize exposure to declining prices on our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production, by using a series of swaps and/or costless collars. Unrealized gains or losses associated with hedges vary period to period, and will be a function of hedges in place, the strike prices of those hedges and the forward curve pricing for the commodities being hedged.        We currently have hedges in place for 70% and 67% of currently forecasted PDP oil production for 2020 and 2021, respectively, at average floor prices of $55.13 and $51.71 per barrel, respectively. For natural gas, we have 68% and 57% of currently forecasted PDP production for 2020 and 2021, respectively, hedged at average floor prices of $2.57 and $2.49 per mmbtu, and 76% of forecasted PDP production for the first quarter of 2022 hedged with swaps at $2.54 per mmbtu. Approximately 98% of our hedges are swaps, and we have no three way collars or short puts.

Historically, we have been dependent upon a few purchasers for a significant portion of our revenue. The largest purchaser of our production for the year ended December 31, 2019, calculated on an equivalent basis, was ConocoPhillips Company (36.4%). As a result of our acquisition of White Star, additional purchasers that will acquire a meaningful percentage of our production in the future are Enlink Midstream Operating, LP (11.6% of combined December 2019 production), Mustang Gas Products, LLC and Valero Marketing and Supply Company. This concentration may increase our overall exposure to credit risk, and our purchasers will likely be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our significant purchasers fails to pay us or ceases to acquire our production on terms that are favorable to us. However, we believe our current purchasers could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions.
 Competition
 The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with numerous other companies. Our competitors in the exploration, development, acquisition and production business include major integrated oil and gas 

 
  10
 
companies as well as numerous independent companies, including many that have significantly greater financial resources.
 The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and gas properties and obtaining purchasers and transporters for the natural gas and oil we produce. There is also competition between producers of natural gas and oil and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local governments; however, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing natural gas and oil and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. The effect of these risks cannot be accurately predicted.
 Governmental Regulations and Industry Matters    Industry Regulations
 The availability of a ready market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include regulation of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production, federal, state and local regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit, the amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities, and the marketing of competitive fuels. For example, a productive natural gas well may be “shut-in” because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the area in which the well is located. State and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, protect rights to produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids between owners in a common reservoir, control the amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by assigning allowable rates of production, and protect the environment. Pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local agencies. We are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws, the effects of which cannot be predicted.
 The following discussion summarizes the regulation of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Such statutes, rules, regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions, and there can be no assurance that such changes or reinterpretations will not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject.
 Regulation of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Exploration and Production
 Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units, and therefore more difficult to develop a project, if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. Inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently expanded, amended and interpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations.

 Regulation of Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas
 Federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas produced by us, and the manner in which such production is transported and marketed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (the “Decontrol Act”) deregulated natural gas prices for all “first sales” of natural gas, including all sales by us of our own production. As a result, all of our domestically produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. However, the Decontrol Act did not affect the FERC’s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation.
 Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts gas gathering facilities from the FERC's jurisdiction. We believe that the gas gathering facilities we own meet the traditional tests the FERC has used to establish a pipeline system's status as a non-jurisdictional gatherer. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Moreover, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of litigation from time to time, so the classification and regulation of some of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC and the courts. While we own some gas gathering facilities, we also depend on gathering facilities owned and operated by third parties to gather production from our properties, and therefore, we are affected by the rates charged by these third parties for gathering services. To the extent that changes in federal or state regulation affect the rates charged for gathering services, we also may be affected by these changes. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we would be affected any differently than similarly situated gas producers.
 Under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “2005 Act”), the NGA has been amended to prohibit market manipulation by any person, including marketers, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas, and the FERC has issued regulations to implement this prohibition. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) also holds authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and derivative futures commodity markets including oil and natural gas. With regard to physical purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are thus required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the CFTC. FERC holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to potentially assess maximum civil penalties of approximately $1.24 million per day per violation, subject to annual adjustment for inflation. CFTC also holds substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to potentially assess maximum civil penalties of up to approximately $1.21 million per violation or triple the monetary gain. 
 Under the 2005 Act, the FERC has also established regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through, among other things, new reporting requirements and expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold. For example, on December 26, 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Order No. 704 requires buyers and sellers of natural gas above a de minimis level, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to submit on May 1 of each year an annual report to FERC describing their aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704 as clarified in orders on clarification and rehearing. In addition, to the extent that we enter into transportation contracts with interstate pipelines that are subject to FERC regulation, we are subject to FERC requirements related to use of such interstate capacity. Any failure on our part to comply with the FERC’s regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties.
 Our natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation. Following the Congressional passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “NGPA”), the FERC adopted a series of regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas. Beginning with the adoption of Order No. 436, issued in October 1985, the FERC has implemented a series of major restructuring orders that have required interstate pipelines, among other things, to perform “open access” transportation of gas for others, “unbundle” their sales and transportation functions, and allow shippers to release their unneeded capacity temporarily and permanently to other shippers. As a result of these changes, sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular interstate pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties. We believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while, at the same time, 

 
  12
 
substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace. It remains to be seen, however, what effect the FERC’s other activities will have on access to markets, the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business. We cannot predict what new or different regulations the FERC and other regulatory agencies may adopt, or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such new or different regulations materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete.
 In the past, Congress has been very active in the area of gas regulation. However, as discussed above, the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation, or “lighter handed” regulation, and the promotion of competition in the gas industry. There regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures that, if enacted, would significantly affect the natural gas industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such new legislative proposals materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete.
 Oil Price Controls and Transportation Rates 
 Sales prices of oil, condensate and gas liquids by us are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Our sales of these commodities are, however, subject to laws and to regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) prohibiting manipulative or fraudulent conduct in the wholesale petroleum market. The FTC holds substantial enforcement authority under these regulations, including the ability to potentially assess maximum civil penalties of approximately $1.18 million per day per violation, subject to annual adjustment for inflation. Our sales of these commodities, and any related hedging activities, are also subject to CFTC oversight as discussed above. 
 The price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. Much of the transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines. Effective as of January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The FERC’s regulation of oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines, although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year. Every five years, the FERC must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry. We are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations or FERC proceedings, if any, on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations.
 There regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures that, if enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time, it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on us. We do not believe that we will be affected by any such new legislative proposals materially differently than any other seller of petroleum with which we compete.
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters 
 Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental authorities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures or costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays, cancellations or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas. The public continues to have a significant interest in the protection of the environment. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment, and thus any new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that result in more stringent and costly exploration, production and development activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal or remediation requirements could result in increased costs of our doing business and consequently affect our profitability. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance 

 
  13
 
that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund Law”, and similar state laws, impose strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These potentially responsible persons include the current or past owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property or natural resource damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
 We also generate wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (the “RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. The RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes, and the EPA and analogous state agencies stringently enforce the approved methods of management and disposal of these wastes. While the RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes, allowing us to manage these wastes under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements, we can provide no assurance that this exemption will be preserved in the future. Any removal of this exclusion could increase the amount of waste we are required to manage and dispose of as hazardous waste rather than non-hazardous waste, and could cause us to incur increased operating costs, which could have a significant impact on us as well as the natural gas and oil industry in general.
 The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various pre-construction, operating, monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues.
 There remains continued public, governmental and scientific attention regarding climate change, with the EPA having determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment. As a result, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, impose permit reviews and restrict emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. These EPA regulations could adversely affect our operations and restrict, delay or halt our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. Additionally, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States on an annual basis, including certain onshore and offshore production facilities, which include the majority of our operations. We are monitoring and annually reporting on GHG emissions from certain of our operations.
 While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that include consideration of cap-and-trade programs whereby major sources of GHG emissions are required to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs, as well as carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. Internationally, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the United States in April 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, the United States began the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement by submitting formal notifications to the United Nations, but the withdrawal will not take effect until one year from delivery of the notification, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would 

 
  14
 
impact our business, any such future international, federal or state laws or regulations that impose reporting obligations on us with respect to, or require the elimination of GHG emissions from, our equipment or operations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the United States. Any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of an issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. However, in September 2019, the EPA repealed the 2015 rule, and in January 2020 finalized a new rule narrowing the scope of the WOTUS definition. The repeal of the 2015 is currently subject to legal challenge, and the revised WOTUS definition of 2020 is expected to be subject to legal challenge once it legally takes effect on March 23, 2020. 
 The disposal of oil and natural gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended (the “SDWA”), and analogous state laws. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations generate produced water, drilling muds and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed via injection in underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations, and thus, those activities are subject to the SWDA. The Underground Injection Well Program under the SDWA requires that we obtain permits from the EPA or analogous state agencies for our disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for injection well operations, restricts the types and quantities that may be injected, and prohibits the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater, potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource, and imposition of liability by third parties for alternative water supplies, property and natural resource damages and personal injuries. Furthermore, in response to a growing concern that the injection of produced water and other fluids into belowground disposal wells triggers seismic activity in certain areas, some states, including Texas and Oklahoma, where we operate, have imposed, and other states are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting or operation of produced water injection wells. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“TRC”) has adopted a final rule governing the permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that requires, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well fails to demonstrate that the injected fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the TRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. In Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission issued various orders and regulations applicable to disposal operations in specific counties in Oklahoma in 2016. These rules require that disposal well operators, among other things, conduct additional mechanical integrity testing, make sure that their wells are not injecting wastes into targeted formations, and/or reduce the volumes of wastes disposed in such wells. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. These existing and any new seismic requirements applicable to disposal wells that impose more stringent permitting or operational requirements could result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of produced water and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs.
 The federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (the “OPA”), and regulations thereunder impose a variety of regulations on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in U.S. waters. The OPA applies to vessels, onshore facilities and offshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities and lessees and permittees of offshore leases may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. In January 2018, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) raised the OPA’s damages liability cap to $137.7 million; however, while liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability 

 
  15
 
limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA. The OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans. These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill. The OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35 million and $150 million for companies operating on the federal Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) waters, including the Gulf of Mexico. We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $35 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS. In addition, to the extent our offshore lease operations affect state waters, we may be subject to additional state and local clean-up requirements or incur liability under state and local laws. 
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, or other similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over, or conducted investigations that focus upon, certain aspects of the process, including a suite of proposed rulemakings and final rules issued by the EPA and the federal Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”), which legal requirements, to the extent finalized and implemented by the agencies, may impose more stringent requirements relating to the composition of fracturing fluids, emissions and discharges from hydraulic fracturing, chemical disclosures, and performances of fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands. Congress has from time to time considered, but not enacted, legislation to provide for federal regulation or the banning of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process while, at the state level, several states, including Texas and Wyoming, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Local government may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience restrictions, delays or cancellations in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling or completing wells.
 The National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (“NEPA”) is applicable to oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including Indian lands and lands administered by the BLM. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA are required for exploration and development projects on federal and Indian lands. This process has the potential to delay, limit or increase the cost of developing oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects.
 The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”), provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the United States and prohibits taking of endangered species. The ESA may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as amended. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”), the agency is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by specified timelines. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures as well as time delays or limitations on or cancellations of our drilling program activities, which costs, delays, limitations or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves.

 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
 The BOEM and the BSEE, each agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have, over time, imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for wells in federal waters. For example, in 2016, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (the “NTL #2016-N01”) that became effective in September 2016 and bolsters supplemental financial assurance requirements for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities whereas the BSEE has issued various regulations relating to the safe and environmentally responsible development of energy and mineral resources on the OCS that have resulted in more stringent requirements including, for example, well and blowout preventer design, workplace safety and corporate accountability. Additionally, states may adopt and implement similar or more stringent legal requirements applicable to exploration and production activities in state waters. Compliance with these more stringent regulatory restrictions, together with any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits or exploration, development, oil spill-response and decommissioning plans, and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect, delay or cancel new drilling and ongoing development efforts. If the BOEM determines that increased financial assurance is required in connection with our offshore facilities but we are unable to provide the necessary supplemental bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the BOEM could impose monetary penalties or require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur, the United States could elect to again issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the offshore-related matters described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 These regulatory actions, or any new rules, regulations or legal initiatives that may be adopted or enforced by the BOEM or the BSEE in the future could delay or disrupt our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations conducted offshore, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding and costs, and limit or cancel activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases. 
 Moreover, under existing BOEM rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interest may be held jointly and severally liable for decommissioning of OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by the BOEM, in the event that the assignee, or any subsequent assignee, is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning. In the event that we, in the role of assignor, receive orders from the BOEM to decommission OCS facilities that one of our assignees, or any subsequent assignee, of offshore facilities is unwilling or unable to perform, we could incur costs to perform decommissioning, which costs could be material. If the BOEM determines that increased financial assurance is required in connection with our or any previously assigned offshore facilities but we are unable to provide the necessary supplemental bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the BOEM could impose monetary penalties or require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled. 
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion on hydraulic fracturing; ozone standards; climate change, including methane or other GHG emissions; releases of regulated substances; offshore regulatory safety and environmental development requirements, and other aspects of compliance with legal or financial assurance requirements or relating to environmental protection, including with respect to offshore leases. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards or more stringent enforcement programs continue to evolve.
 Other Laws and Regulations
 Various laws and regulations often require permits for drilling wells and also cover spacing of wells, the prevention of waste of natural gas and oil including maintenance of certain gas/oil ratios, rates of production and other matters. The effect of these laws and regulations, as well as other regulations that could be promulgated by the jurisdictions in which the Company has production, could be to limit the number of wells that could be drilled on the 

 
  17
 
Company’s properties and to limit the allowable production from the successful wells completed on the Company’s properties, thereby limiting the Company’s revenues.
 Whereas the BLM administers oil and natural gas leases held by the Company on federal onshore lands, the BOEM administers the natural gas and oil leases held by the Company on federal offshore tracts on the OCS. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) collects a royalty interest in these federal leases on behalf of the federal government. While the royalty interest percentage is fixed at the time that the lease is entered into, from time to time the ONRR changes or reinterprets the applicable regulations governing its royalty interests, and such action can indirectly affect the actual royalty obligation that the Company is required to pay. However, the Company believes that the regulations generally do not impact the Company to any greater extent than other similarly situated producers. 
 To cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells, decommission or remove platforms and pipelines, and clear the seafloor of obstructions at the end of production (collectively, “decommissioning obligations”), the BOEM generally requires that lessees post supplemental bonds or other acceptable financial assurances that such obligations will be met. Historically, our financial assurance costs to satisfy decommissioning obligations have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, the BOEM continues to consider imposing more stringent financial assurance requirements on offshore operators on the OCS. For example, the BOEM issued NTL #2016-N01 that went into effect in September 2016 and augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees, among others, to assure that sufficient funds are available to satisfy decommissioning obligations on the OCS. If the BOEM determines under this new NTL that a company does not satisfy the minimum requirements to qualify for providing self-insurance to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance. In June 2017, the BOEM extended indefinitely the start date for implementation of NTL #2016-N01. This extension currently remains in effect; however, the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue liability orders in the future, including if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning obligations.  
 The BOEM may elect to retain NTL #2016-N01 in its current form or may make revisions thereto and, thus, until the BOEM determines whether and to what extent any additional financial assurance may be required by us with respect to our offshore operations, we cannot provide assurance that such financial assurance coverage can be obtained. Moreover, the BOEM could in the future make other demands for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under sole liability properties and/or non-sole liability properties. In the event that we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds or assurances as requested, the BOEM may require certain of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or cancelled or otherwise impose monetary penalties. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a further discussion on BOEM and its implementation of NTL #2016-N01.
 Risk and Insurance Program    In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from significant losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life, and liability claims of third parties, including such occurrences as well blowouts and weather events that result in oil spills and damage to our wells and/or platforms. Our goal is to balance the cost of insurance with our assessment of the potential risk of an adverse event. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice, and we regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.
 We continuously monitor regulatory changes and regulatory responses and their impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance, against the potential and magnitude of disruption to our operations and cash flows. Changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico could lead to tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage and higher premiums, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills.
 Health, Safety and Environmental Program
 Our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HS&E”) Program is supervised by senior management to ensure compliance with all state and federal regulations. In support of the operating committee, we have contracted with J. Connor Consulting (“JCC”) to coordinate the regulatory process relative to our offshore assets. JCC is a regulatory 

 
  18
 
consulting firm specializing in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. They provide preparation of incident response plans, safety and environmental services and facilitation of comprehensive oil spill response training and drills on behalf of oil and gas companies and pipeline operators.
 Additionally, in support of our Gulf of Mexico operations, we have established a Regional Oil Spill Response Plan which has been approved by the BSEE. Our response team is trained annually and is tested through in-house spill drills. We have also contracted with O’Brien’s Response Management (“O’Brien’s”), who maintains an incident command center on 24 hour alert in Houston, TX. In the event of an oil spill, the Company’s response program is initiated by notifying O’Brien’s of any reportable incident. While the Company response team is mobilized to focus on source control and containment of the spill, O’Brien’s coordinates communications with state and federal agencies and provides subject matter expertise in support of the response team.
 We also have contracted with Clean Gulf Associates (“CGA”) to assist with equipment and personnel needs in the event of a spill. CGA specializes in onsite control and cleanup and is on 24-hour alert with equipment currently stored at eight bases along the gulf coast, from South Texas to East Louisiana. The CGA equipment stockpile is available to serve member oil spill response needs and includes open seas skimmers, shoreline protection boom, communications equipment, dispersants with application systems, wildlife rehabilitation and a forward command center. CGA has retainers with aerial dispersant and mechanical recovery equipment contractors for spill response.
 In addition to our membership in CGA, the Company has contracted with Wild Well Control for source control at the wellhead, if required. Wild Well Control is one of the world’s leading providers of firefighting and well control services.
 We also have a full time health, safety and environmental professional who supports our operations and oversees the implementation of our onshore HS&E policies. 
 Safety and Environmental Management System
 We have developed and implemented a Safety and Environmental Management System (“SEMS”) to address oil and gas operations in the OCS, as required by the BSEE. Our SEMS identifies and mitigates safety and environmental hazards and the impacts of these hazards on design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection and maintenance of all new and existing facilities. The Company has established goals, performance measures, training and accountability for SEMS implementation. We also provide the necessary resources to maintain an effective SEMS, and we review the adequacy and effectiveness of the SEMS program annually. Company facilities are designed, constructed, maintained, monitored and operated in a manner compatible with industry codes, consensus standards and all applicable governmental regulations. We have contracted with Island Technologies Inc. to coordinate our SEMS program and to track compliance for production operations.
 The BSEE enforces the SEMS requirements through regular audits. Failure of an audit may result in an Incident of Non-Compliance and could ultimately result in the assessment of civil penalties and/or require a shut-in of our Gulf of Mexico operations if not resolved within the required time.
 Employees
 On December 31, 2019, we had 124 full time employees, of which 62 were field personnel. Half of our  employees were previous White Star employees at the time of the acquisition. We have been able to attract and retain a talented team of industry professionals that have been successful in achieving significant growth and success in the past. As such, we are well-positioned to adequately manage and develop our existing assets and also to increase our proved reserves and production through exploitation of our existing asset base, as well as the continuing identification, acquisition and development of new growth opportunities. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
     In addition to our employees, we use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. As a working interest owner, we rely on certain outside operators to drill, produce and market our natural gas and oil where we are a non-operator. In prospects where we are the operator, we rely on drilling contractors to drill and sometimes rely on independent contractors to produce and market our natural gas and oil. In addition, we frequently utilize the services of independent contractors to perform field and on-site drilling and production operation services and independent third party engineering firms to evaluate our reserves.

Information on our website or any other website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this report. Seasonal Nature of Business
 The demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates depending on the time of year. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or cooler summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial end users utilize oil and natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand.
