Item 1 Business
General Corporate History
 
Ecoark Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 19, 2007 under the name Magnolia Solar Corporation (“Magnolia Solar”). On March 18, 2016, Magnolia Solar filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada thereby changing its name to Ecoark Holdings, Inc.
Overview
 
Ecoark Holdings Inc. (“Ecoark Holdings” or the “Company”) is a diversified holding company. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has operations in three areas: (i) oil and gas, including exploration, production and drilling operations and transportation services, (ii) post-harvest shelf-life and freshness food management technology, and (iii) financial services including consulting, fund administration and asset management. The Company’s subsidiaries consist of Banner Midstream Corp., (“Banner Midstream”), White River Holdings Corp. (“White River”), Shamrock Upstream Energy LLC (“Shamrock”), Pinnacle Frac Transport LLC (“Pinnacle Frac”), Capstone Equipment Leasing LLC (“Capstone”), Ecoark, Inc. (“Ecoark”), Zest Labs, Inc. (“Zest Labs”), and Trend Discovery Holdings Inc. (“Trend Holdings”).
 
White River and Shamrock are engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
 
Pinnacle Frac provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Capstone procures and finances equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors.
 
Since the acquisition of Banner Midstream on March 27, 2020, which currently comprises the exploration, production and drilling operations, the Company has focused its efforts to a considerable extent on expanding its exploration and production footprint and capabilities by acquiring real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases.
 
On June 11, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SR Acquisition I, LLC for $1,000 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of 262 total wells in Mississippi and Louisiana, approximately 9,000 acres of active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment. The 262 total wells include 57 active producing wells, 19 active disposal wells, 136 shut-in with future utility wells, and 50 shut-in pending plugging wells. Included in the assignment are 4 wells in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation.

On June 18, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SN TMS, LLC for $500 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of wells, active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment.
 
On August 14, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company, White River E&P LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Rabb Resources, LTD. and Claude Rabb, the sole owner of Rabb Resources, LTD. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Rabb Resources, LTD. The acquired assets consisted of certain real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases. The Company in June 2020 previously provided for bridge financing to Rabb Resources, LTD under the $225,000 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. As consideration for entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Rabb Resources, LTD. A total of $3,500,000 consisting of (i) $1,500,000 in cash, net of $304 in outstanding amounts related to the note receivable and accrued interest receivable, and (ii) $2,000,000 payable in common stock of the Company, which based on the closing price of the common stock as of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement equaled 103,000 shares. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the Rabb Resources, LTD historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.
 
On September 4, 2020, White River SPV 3, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banner Midstream entered into an Agreement and Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease with a privately held limited liability company (the “Assignor”). Under the Lease Assignment, the Assignor assigned a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in a certain oil and gas lease covering in excess of 1,600 acres (the “Lease”), and White River paid $1,500,000 in cash to the Assignor. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.
 
On October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the “Participation Agreement”) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (“BlackBrush”) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the “Assignor”), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.
 
Pursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV have agreed, among other things, to pre-fund a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800,000, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387,000 has been expensed as drilling costs. The Participation Agreement requires the estimated amount of the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account by the commencement of drilling in January 2021. BlackBrush has agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.
 
The Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the “Operating Agreement”) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties’ rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.

Active drilling commenced on January 15, 2021 and on January 31, 2021 the drilling reached its targeted location in the Austin Chalk formation. On February 13, 2021, the drilling had reached its first milestone which initiated a contractual vesting of asset assignments with the successful drilling of a minimum lateral distance of 2,500 feet. On February 14, 2021, we reached its second milestone, with the conclusion of drilling of a lateral with a full vertical section distance of 4,046 feet. The well was drilled successfully using managed pressure drilling techniques, allowing for visibility of the productive intervals throughout the drilling process in the Austin Chalk.
 
On September 30, 2020, the Company and White River Energy, LLC (“White River Energy”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into three asset purchase agreements (the “Asset Purchase Agreements”) with privately-held limited liability companies to acquire working interests in the Harry O’Neal oil and gas mineral lease (the “O’Neal OGML”), the related well bore, crude oil inventory and equipment. Immediately prior to the acquisition, White River Energy owned an approximately 61% working interest in the O’Neal OGML oil well and a 100% working interest in any future wells.
 
The purchase prices of these leases were $126,000, $312,000 and $312,000, respectively, totaling $750,000. The consideration paid to the Sellers was in the form of 68,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.
 
In February and March 2021, the Company acquired additional leases for $916,000 under the Blackbrush/Deshotel lease related to the Participation Agreement.

Impact of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the U.S. and global economy and may continue to affect the economy and the industries in which we operate, depending on the vaccine rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations.
 
COVID-19 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. However, it did have a material impact on our management’s ability to operate effectively. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines.
 
While it is not possible at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the continued impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company’s business, future outbreaks and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company’s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic economic conditions, including the reducing demand for oil, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company’s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the Company’s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.
 
The Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Security Act (“CARES Act”) includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), whereby certain small business are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We have received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that as indicated in our Consolidated Statement of Operations has been forgiven.
 
Description of Business
 
Banner Midstream Corp
 
Through its indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries Pinnacle Frac, Capstone, White River, and Shamrock, the Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, as well as transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations, and procurement and financing of equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors.
 
The Company entered the oil and gas industry following the previously disclosed acquisition of Banner Midstream Corp. on March 27, 2020.
 
Zest Labs
 
Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Zest Labs, the Company offers freshness management solutions for fresh food growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, grocers and restaurants. Its Zest Fresh solution is a cloud-based post-harvest shelf-life and freshness management solution that improves delivered freshness of produce and protein and reduces post-harvest losses at the retailer due to temperature handling and processing by 50% or more by intelligently matching customer freshness requirements with actual product freshness. It focuses on four primary value propositions – operational efficiency, consistent food freshness, reduced waste, and improved food safety. Zest Fresh empowers workers with real-time analytic tools and alerts that improve efficiency while driving quality consistency through best practice adherence at a pallet level. Zest Labs also offers its Zest Delivery solution that provides real-time monitoring and control for prepared food delivery containers, helping delivery and dispatch personnel ensure the quality and safety of delivered food.

On June 6, 2019, Zest Labs announced a strategic collaboration between AgroFresh and Zest Labs to strengthen their end-to-end solutions. AgroFresh will incorporate Zest Labs’ Zest Fresh™ solution into its FreshCloud™ Transit Insights platform. The agreement will utilize both companies’ resources and strengths to provide customers with a comprehensive solution that improves operations, increases visibility into produce shelf-life and reduces food waste.
 
Zest Labs was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 23, 2004.
 
The Zest Fresh value proposition is to reduce fresh food loss by improving quality consistency. In the U.S. produce market, it is reported that roughly 30% of post-harvest fresh food is lost or wasted and therefore not consumed. Both fresh food producers and retailers bear significant expense when harvested food is either rejected due to early spoilage or reduced in value due to early ripening. Zest Labs believes that a significant portion of this waste can be attributed to inconsistent quality or freshness based on variable post-harvest processing and handling. Fresh food producers and retailers manage food distribution and inventory based on the harvest date, with the assumption that all food harvested on the same day will have the same freshness. However, studies have shown that harvest conditions and post-harvest handling can have a significant effect on the actual remaining freshness and, if not properly accounted for, can result in food loss or spoilage ahead of expectations. Zest Fresh empowers fresh food producers and retailers to significantly reduce the post-harvest loss by providing real-time guidance to process adherence, intelligent distribution and best handling practices, with a goal of providing significant financial savings to fresh food producers and retailers. 
 
Zest Labs has developed the industry’s first freshness metric called the Zest Intelligent Pallet Routing Code (“ZIPR Code”). The ZIPR Code has three main components: (i) Harvest Quality which sets total freshness capacity (for example, 12 days for strawberries), (ii) Handling Impact which reflects aging acceleration due to improper handling, and (iii) Future Handling which accurately reflects how the product will be handled (for example, store shelf temperature may be 40 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 34 degrees Fahrenheit). 
 
Zest Fresh is offered to fresh food producers, processors, distributors, restaurants and grocers with pricing based on the number of pallets managed by Zest Fresh, typically from the field harvest through retail grocery delivery. The Zest Fresh service includes a re-usable wireless Internet of Things (“IoT”) condition sensor that travels with the pallet of fresh food from the field or processor through retail delivery, continuously collecting product condition data. The collected pallet product data is analyzed, using artificial intelligence-based predictive analytics in real time by the Zest Fresh cloud-based solution, with the fresh food producers and retailers accessing data through Zest Fresh web and mobile applications. Zest Fresh provides workers with real-time feedback on the current handling or processing of each pallet, empowering best practice adherence to achieve maximum freshness. Zest Fresh also provides dynamic updates as to actual product freshness for each pallet, enabling intelligent routing and inventory management of each pallet in a manner that ensures optimum delivered freshness. Zest Fresh also includes integrated blockchain support to grower and shipper customers via the Zest Fresh platform. 
 
Zest Labs’ Zest Delivery solution helps to manage prepared food delivery from the restaurant through to the customer. Zest Delivery manages the delivery container environment, both monitoring and controlling the product condition. The value of Zest Delivery is to manage prepared meals in an ideal state for consumption, while accommodating extended pre-staging or delivery times. Extended pre-staging times are associated with “instant delivery” services of prepared meals, where the meals are often pre-staged in a delivery area ahead of demand. While pre-staging enables fast demand response time, it can result in prepared meals being staged for extended periods, which can potentially impact quality, value and safety. Zest Delivery monitors and controls the delivery container environment to preserve the prepared meal in ideal, ready to consume condition. Zest Delivery also provides the dispatcher with real-time remote visibility to the condition of available meals and confirming quality prior to dispatch. Zest Delivery provides automated, real-time visibility for a very distributed fleet of drivers, reflecting prepared meal food safety, quality and availability. Zest Delivery is offered to meal delivery companies based on the quantity of delivery containers and frequency of use.
 
Zest Labs currently holds rights to 75 U.S. patents (with additional patents pending), numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including Radio-Frequency Identification (“RFID”) technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest Labs has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for “Intelleflex,” the Intelleflex logo, “Zest,” “Zest Data Services,” and the Zest, Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery logos, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest Labs’ products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates.

Although most components essential to Zest Labs’ business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain RFID or other wireless custom integrated circuits, and application-specific integrated circuits are currently obtained by Zest Labs from single or limited sources, principally in Asia.
 
Zest Labs is part of a very competitive industry that markets solutions to fresh food supply chain users, such as fresh food growers, producers and retailers. Many other companies that are both more established and command much greater resources compete in this market. While Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery offer new technical approaches and new user value, it remains uncertain if Zest Labs will gain sufficient adoption of its products to make them viable in the market. Further, it is unclear what industry competitors are developing that might address similar user needs. Zest Labs’ products provide a new approach for industry participants, and as with any new approach, adoption is uncertain as many in the industry can be slow to embrace new technology and/or new approaches. These market challenges can lead to extended sales cycles that may include extended pilot testing often at Zest Labs’ expense, for which the outcome remains unclear until the completion of each test. For these reasons, and others, forecasting new business adoption and future revenue can be very difficult and volatile; however, the Company believes that Zest Fresh offers fresh food retailers, growers, shippers, processors and distributors an opportunity to differentiate their businesses in ways that the shipment of canned and boxed food products cannot, as competition in the agriculture, grocery, food service and restaurant markets continues to accelerate. 
 
Our ability to execute our strategy with respect to our freshness management solutions depends in part on the outcome of the litigation related to protection of our intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for more information.
 
Trend Capital Management
 
Before we acquired Trend Holdings in May 2019 by merging Trend Holdings with and into the Company, Trend Holdings was a financial services holding company with two primary subsidiaries: Trend Discovery Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Trend Capital Management”), and Barrier Crest, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Barrier Crest”). 
 
Trend Capital Management was founded in 2011 and was Trend Holding’s primary asset.  Trend Capital Management provides services and collects fees from entities including Trend LP and Trend SPV, both of which invest in securities.  Trend Capital Management neither invests in securities nor have any role in Trend LP and Trend SPV’s purchase of securities.  The investment capital in Trend LP and Trend SPV is from individual limited partners, and not from the Company. 
 
In the near-term, Trend LP’s performance will be driven by its investment in Volans-i, a fully autonomous vertical takeoff and landing drone delivery platform (“Volans”).  Trend LP currently owns approximately 1% of Volans and has participation rights to future financings to maintain such ownership at 1% indefinitely. More information can be found at website. www.flyvoly.com, the contents of which are not incorporated into this report. 
 
Barrier Crest provides fund administration and fund formation services to institutional investors.  Barrier Crest provides fund administration services to Trend LP and Trend SPV.

Competition

The Company faces intense competition with respect to its products and services in all markets in which it operates.
 
In the oil and gas industry, we are producing and selling crude oil as a commodity so we compete against. All producers including individual well owners through the supermajor oil companies. Some of these competitors at the major and supermajor categories possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.
 
The market for cloud-based, real-time supply chain analytic solutions—the market in which Zest Labs competes—is highly competitive and is rapidly evolving. There are several new competitors with competing technologies, including companies that have greater resources than Ecoark Holdings, which operate in this space. Some of these companies are subsidiaries of large publicly traded companies that have brand recognition, established relationships with retailers, and own the manufacturing process.
 
Trend Holdings and its subsidiaries have significant competition from larger companies with greater assets and resources.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Through Banner Midstream and its subsidiaries, the Company sells and provides services to its customers via a blanket master services agreement (MSA). Banner Midstream sells hydrocarbon to midstream providers such as Plains Marketing L.P. and Shell Trading (US) Company.
 
The Company markets its technology products and services principally through direct sales efforts and the utilization of third-party agents. Zest Labs has marketing operations and programs for demand generation, public relations, and branding/messaging that are scaled based on market engagement and available resources.
 
Trend Holdings and its subsidiaries provide fund administration and fund formation services to institutional investors and market their services through private marketing.

Government Regulations 
 
Banner Midstream
 
Oil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we operate, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico (the “Territory”), have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, states in the Territory impose a severance tax on production and sales of oil, and gas within its jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Zest Labs
 
Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates.  The Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for non-government use in the United States in accordance with regulations established by an international organization known as the International Telecommunications Union (the “ITU”). Any ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception of GPS signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of Zest Labs’ products, which would, in turn, cause a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Environmental Compliance Expenses
 
We are currently not experiencing any material expenses related to the environmental compliance. Please review Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report with regard to potential environmental compliance expenses.
Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy (ESG)
 
We are currently evaluating an environmentally conscious cryptocurrency mining approach to focus on and analyze innovative and valuable ways to deploy capital. We are focused on opportunities related to ESG technologies for hydrocarbon emissions and reductions in energy waste. We have formulated an approach to pursue regionally constrained energy that is otherwise lost due to a lack of commercial infrastructure to economically process and/or transport the natural gas to market. This approach is designed to drive significant molecule value through the energy intensive process of cryptocurrency mining. This strategy is anticipated to incubate green energy project development and growth by balancing regional power grid demands during times of heightened use.
Research and Development
 
We have devoted a substantial amount of our resources to software and hardware development activities in recent years, principally for the Zest Labs initiatives. Ecoark Holdings believes that, analyzing the competitive factors affecting the market for the solutions and services its subsidiaries provide, its products and services compete favorably by offering integrated solutions to customers. The Company has incurred research and development expenses of $883,000 and $2,472,000 in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to develop its solutions and differentiate those solutions from competitive offerings. We incurred no capitalized software development costs in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company, through Zest Labs, currently holds rights to 75 U.S. patents (with additional patents pending), numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including Radio-Frequency Identification (“RFID”) technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest Labs has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for “Intelleflex,” the Intelleflex logo, “Zest,” “Zest Data Services,” and the Zest, Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery logos, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest Labs’ products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates. 
No Foreign Operations
 
No foreign operations are expected in connection with the Company’s business. 
 
Seasonality
 
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality due to our oil and gas exploration and transportation business. Demand for oil, natural gas and energy is typically higher in the third and fourth quarters resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas of trucking business. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for the drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations, thus, lowering the demand for trucking services.
Dependence on One or Few Major Customers
 
From time to time we may have customers generating 10 percent or more of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and loss of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of the date of this report, we have 45 full-time employees and 106 owner-operator truck drivers.
 
Our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives is highly dependent on recruiting and retaining skilled personnel and qualified drivers. Our compensation philosophy is based on incentivizing and rewarding performance, with alignment of individual, corporate, and stockholder interests. Compensation includes salaries, benefits, and equity participation. Our owner operator drivers are not salaried employees.
 
We are committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and drivers. We follow applicable local, state, and federal laws, regulations, and guidance. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented measures to enable employees to work remotely and have utilized cloud-based productivity and communications systems to facilitate distributed work.
 
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to ensure that all employees maintain the highest standards of business conduct in every aspect of their dealings with each other, customers, suppliers, vendors, service providers, stockholders, and governmental authorities.
 
We believe the relations with our employees and drivers are satisfactory.
