Our business was organized into two segments during fiscal 2017 - Wireless DataCom, comprising all of our current operations, and Satellite, a legacy business that we brought to a close effective August 31, 2016. Since September 1, 2016, our business operates under a single segment  Wireless DataCom. 
 In March 2016, we acquired all outstanding common stock of LoJack Corporation (LoJack), a global leader in products and services for tracking and recovering cars, trucks and other valuable mobile assets. LoJack became a component of the Companys Wireless DataCom business segment.

SATELLITE
 Prior to the closure of the Companys Satellite business, products of this business segment were sold to EchoStar, an affiliate of Dish Network, for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems. In April 2016, EchoStar notified the Company that it would stop purchasing products from the Company at the end of its then-current product demand forecast as a result of a consolidation of its supplier base. EchoStars product demand forecast with the Company extended through August 2016, and the products covered by this forecast were substantially all shipped prior to August 31, 2016. In light of the fact that EchoStar accounted for essentially all of the revenues of the Satellite segment, the Companys Satellite business was shut down effective August 31, 2016.

 MANUFACTURING 
 Electronic devices, components and made-to-order assemblies used in our products are generally obtained from a number of suppliers, although certain components are obtained from sole source suppliers. Some devices or components are standard items while others are manufactured to our specifications by our suppliers. The Company believes that most raw materials are available from alternative suppliers. However, any significant interruption in the delivery of such items, particularly those that are sole source materials or components, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations. 
 We outsource printed circuit board assembly, system subassembly and testing, as well as full turn-key production of some products, to contract manufacturers in the Pacific Rim, and we perform final assembly and test for some products at the Companys facility in Oxnard, California.
 A substantial portion of our products, components and subassemblies are procured from foreign suppliers and contract manufacturers located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Any significant shift in U.S. trade policy toward these countries, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of or any political instability in these countries, could cause disruption to the Companys supply chain or otherwise disrupt the Companys operations, which could adversely impact the Companys business. 
 We are certified to the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 9001: 2008 Quality management systems standard.
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Each of the markets in which we compete in is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new product features to meet market requirements. During the last three years, we have focused our research and development resources primarily on developing telematics products and software solutions for fleet management, heavy equipment, stolen vehicle recovery, crash detection and discrimination, and industrial monitoring and controls applications. We have developed key technology platforms that can be leveraged across many of our markets and applications. These include cloud-based telematics application enablement software platforms and the end-user software applications, cellular and satellite communications network-based asset tracking units, as well as 3G and 4G broadband router products for fixed and mobile applications. In addition, development resources have been allocated to broadening existing product lines, reducing product costs, and improving performance through product redesign efforts. 
 Research and development expenses in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $22.0 million, $19.8 million and $19.9 million, respectively. During this three-year period, our research and development expenses have ranged between 6% and 8% of annual consolidated revenues.
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 Our revenues are derived mainly from customers in the United States, which represented 74%, 83% and 79% of consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 Our Wireless DataCom segment sells its products and services through dedicated direct and indirect sales channels with employees distributed across the U. S., with additional marketing and sales personnel in Latin America, the Middle East and Europe. 
 Our Satellite segment sold its products primarily to EchoStar, an affiliate of Dish Network, for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems. The sales and marketing functions for the Satellite segment were located at our facility in Oxnard, California.

COMPETITION
 Our markets are highly competitive. In addition, if the markets for our products and solutions grow, we anticipate increased competition from new companies entering such markets, some of whom may have financial and technical resources substantially greater than ours. We believe that competition in our markets is based primarily on innovation, reputation, product functionality and reliability, responsiveness and price. Our continued success in these markets will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate, design quality products and deploy solutions at competitive prices and provide superior support to our customers. 
 We believe that the principal competitors for our products and solutions include Danlaw, Geotab, Guidepoint Systems, Meteorcomm, Mobile Devices, OnStar, Orbcomm, Quake Global, Queclink, Sierra Wireless, Spireon, Telogis, Xirgo, Zonar Systems and ZTE.
