Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the body’s innate biology to repair or reverse damage caused by a broad range of degenerative diseases and a global leader in the science and development of medicines for inner-ear cellular regeneration and hearing restoration. Our initial focus is on advancing our lead product candidate, FX-322, through clinical studies with the goal of developing and commercializing a medicine to help millions of patients with the most common form of hearing loss and build upon the potential of regenerative therapeutics for hearing. We believe we are a leading company using mitotic regeneration for cochlear sensory hair cell regeneration and that FX-322 has the potential to meaningfully improve overall hearing function and enhance quality of life. 
 Our proprietary approach, called Progenitor Cell Activation, or PCA, uses combinations of small molecules to activate progenitor cells within the body to create functional tissue.  These progenitor cells, which are closely related to stem cells, are already resident in the targeted location in the body and programmed to develop and differentiate into specific cell types within an organ, which we believe provide us the opportunity to pursue multiple proposed indications and develop potential treatments for an array of degenerative diseases throughout the body. To that end, in addition to our lead program in hearing, we are working to rapidly advance discovery efforts focused on using our PCA approach to potentially remyelinate nerves in patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS and are advancing this program in collaboration with The Scripps Research Institute, or Scripps, and Cambridge Enterprise Limited (the technology transfer arm of the University of Cambridge), or Cambridge. 
 Our hearing program is for a condition called sensorineural hearing loss, or SNHL, which is the most prevalent type of hearing loss, typically caused by permanent loss of sensory hair cells in the cochlea within the ear. Cochlear sensory hair cells can be lost by noise exposure, as a result of aging, certain viral infections or exposure to ototoxic drugs. FX-322 aims to treat the underlying cause of SNHL by regenerating hair cells through the activation of progenitor cells already present in the cochlea. In July 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Astellas Agreement, with Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, under which we granted them rights to develop and commercialize FX-322 outside of the United States.  In September 2019, at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Otolaryngology, the principal investigator from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating FX-322 in 23 patients with stable SNHL shared preclinical and clinical data that showed that FX-322 was well-tolerated with no serious adverse effects and that we observed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in key measures of hearing loss, including word recognition, or WR, and clarity of sound
. Specifically, thirty-three percent (33%) of these subjects achieved a ten percent (10%) or greater absolute improvement in WR scores in the treated ear. The study results were accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Otology and Neurotology and were published in February 2021. They were also presented at the 2021 Association for Research in Otolaryngology 44th Annual Mid-Winter Meeting in February 2021.  
 In October 2019, we commenced dosing in a Phase 2a clinical trial of FX-322 and the FDA granted FX-322 Fast Track designation.  The goals of the trial are to further establish the hearing signal observed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, evaluate the impact of multiple doses and provide insights on endpoints and patient population for further studies. In March 2021, we announced topline, day-90 interim data from the Phase 2a clinical trial. The results showed that four weekly injections in subjects with mild to moderately severe SNHL did not demonstrate improvements in hearing measures versus placebo. While our interim data showed that WR scores increased across all groups, repeated weekly injections appeared to dampen the hearing benefit observed compared to other single injection-studies. The interim results also showed an unexpected apparent level of hearing benefit in the placebo group that did not occur in previous trials and exceeded well-established published standards. No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed in the study. 
 In May 2020, we announced top-line data from an exploratory clinical study in Germany that we believe demonstrated that FX-322 effectively reached the cochlea at levels predicted, based on computer models, to be therapeutically active. Results from the exploratory study showed measurable concentrations of FX-322 in every sample analyzed and that anatomical factors did not prevent FX-322 from reaching the cochlea. The study results were based on analyzing samples of cochlear fluid, known as perilymph, taken intraoperatively from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery. A total of seven patients received a single intratympanic injection of FX-322, enabling researchers to directly measure the level of FX-322 in perilymph, which is not otherwise feasible in inner-ear studies because accessing the cochlea involves an invasive surgical procedure. Study patients were followed for approximately 30 days after the procedure and no serious treatment related adverse events were observed.  The results of this study were included in the article accepted for publication in Otology and Neurotology and published in February 2021.

In June 2020, we shared preliminary findings from a longer-term, follow-up study of certain patients that had been treated with FX-322 in the randomized portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, where we observed improvements in certain key measures of hearing loss. WR tests were performed for five patients at timepoints between 12- and 21-months following FX-322 administration. Four of the patients that were observed to have statistically significant WR scores during the Phase 1/2 clinical trial were observed to have maintained the hearing benefit, three of which remained at statistically significant levels. An additional patient who did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in WR during the Phase 1/2 clinical trial was also retested and it was observed that the WR score had returned to baseline. The results of this study were presented at the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery meeting in September 2020.
 In March 2021, we announced new data from a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 designed to evaluate the impact of injection conditions on tolerability. The data showed hearing improvement from a single injection of FX-322. In the multi-center, randomized study, subjects with mild to severe SNHL (n=33) were injected in one ear with FX-322 with the untreated ear as the control. Hearing function was tested over the course of 90 days following dosing. Thirty-two (n=32) subjects completed the 90 day clinical assessment period and, at day 90 following dosing, thirty-four percent (34%) of these subjects achieved a ten percent (10%) or greater absolute improvement in WR scores in the treated ear, which was clinically meaningful and statistically significant compared to the untreated ear (p <0.05). This included a subset of subjects that more than doubled their WR scores. The single dose had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated.
 We commenced a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 for age-related hearing loss in October 2020. The clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized multicenter safety study of up to 30 individuals aged 66-85 with mild to moderately severe age-related hearing loss. The primary objectives of the Phase 1b study are to assess the local and systemic safety of a single dose of FX-322 and evaluate hearing responses in an older adult cohort. Study participants will be randomized 4:1 to receive either FX-322 or placebo in one ear. Validated measures of hearing including WR, WIN, and pure tone audiometry will be used. Safety, otologic and audiologic assessments will be conducted at day 30 and 90 following administration of FX-322 or placebo. We expect to share results from this clinical trial in the second quarter of 2021.
 We commenced a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 in patients aged 18-65 with severe SNHL in November 2020. Severe SNHL is defined as a pure tone average deficit between 71-90 dB. Many patients with this clinical profile typically would be candidates for cochlear implants. This clinical trial employs a similar design to the age-related Phase 1b clinical trial that is currently underway. We expect to share results from this clinical trial in the third quarter of 2021.
 To date, no drug therapies have been approved by the FDA or, to our knowledge, by other regulatory bodies, for the treatment of SNHL. Existing devices such as hearing aids amplify sounds but do not replace hair cells, which have roles in clarifying sound and improving speech intelligibility, particularly in noisy environments. Hearing aids also cannot repair the underlying pathology of hearing loss. While hearing loss is often thought to be caused by aging, the condition is strongly correlated with living in an industrialized society. According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, 1.5 billion people, 20% of the world’s population, suffer from some degree of hearing loss worldwide, and, according to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, more than 90% of people with hearing loss have SNHL. Based on our estimates, we believe that 41 million people in the United States alone have SNHL. The WHO also estimates that 1.1 billion children and adults ages 12 to 35 years old are at risk for hearing loss from recreational noise exposure. 
 Under the Astellas Agreement, Astellas is responsible for the development and commercialization of FX-322 outside of the United States. As consideration for the licensed rights under the Astellas Agreement, Astellas paid us an upfront payment of $80.0 million in July 2019 and has agreed to pay potential development milestone payments of 
up to $230.0 million. Specifically, we would receive development milestone payments of $65.0 million and $25.0 million upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase 2b clinical trial for SNHL in Europe and Asia, respectively, and $100.0 million and $40.0 million upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial for SNHL in Europe and Asia, respectively.  If the Astellas licensed products are successfully commercialized, we would be eligible for up to $315.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments plus tiered royalties on any future product sales ranging from low- to mid-teen percentages. 
 
Our MS program focuses on activating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the central nervous system to repair the myelin sheath that protects nerves and may have the potential to reverse damage done by the disease. We established an internal research program using PCA to drive remyelination as a potential therapy for MS and have identified compounds that display promising preliminary preclinical results in an in vivo model of remyelination. Our research efforts are focused on optimizing these compounds and identifying a lead therapeutic candidate to advance into clinical trials. We have obtained worldwide licenses for intellectual property from Scripps and Cambridge Enterprise on approaches to promote remyelination of nerve fibers and are engaged in sponsoring clinical research to validate this approach at Cambridge University.

Impact of COVID-19 
 Our offices are located in states that are currently operating under a phased re-opening plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the majority of our employees continue to work from home, while nearly a quarter to one-third of our workforce, consisting of mainly laboratory personnel, have periodically worked in rotating teams to ensure the continuation of essential experiments. Our Farmington, CT research site, co-located with the University of Connecticut, has resumed activity at a fifty percent level after a period of paused activity due to state lock down orders previously in effect. While we have resumed experiments at our Farmington site, we have transitioned certain key experiments to our offices in Woburn, MA and third parties and contract research organizations have been engaged to advance certain projects. We are also have taken steps consistent with the FDA’s updated industry guidance for conducting clinical trials.
 The COVID-19 pandemic, and actions taken to mitigate it, have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which we operate, which could adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, while no significant disruptions have occurred, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause such disruptions in our business or operations, as well as the business and operations of our CMOs, CROs and other third parties with whom we conduct business. The COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely impact our clinical trials, which could impede, delay, limit or prevent the clinical development of our product candidates and ultimately lead to the delay or denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would materially adversely affect our business and operations, including our ability to generate revenue.
 
Our product pipeline 
 The following table summarizes our PCA therapeutic candidate pipeline and discovery research programs: 
 

Our team and history 
 Our company was founded in 2014 with the goal of creating medicines based on breakthrough research focused on activating the body’s regenerative potential. In their groundbreaking research, Professors Robert S. Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Jeffrey Karp at Harvard Medical School, decoded the natural signals between cells that make the intestine one of the most regenerative organs in the body through the continuous activation of progenitor cells. Recognizing that similar progenitor cells were present but inactive in other organs, they discovered how to adapt these natural signals using small molecules to temporarily activate progenitor cells in other organs, including the cochlea, and create a localized healing response. Using these insights, we are developing FX-322 for the treatment of SNHL, and, in a 
 6


Phase 1/2 trial of FX-322 in stable hearing loss patients, we have observed statistically significant improvement in WR, a key measure of hearing function. Further, we have identified several additional potential indications for our PCA platform and expanded our team to incorporate domain expertise to pursue our goal of becoming a fully integrated biotechnology company. 
 Our leadership team includes experienced biotech executives David L. Lucchino, our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Christopher R. Loose, our Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder, Peter P. Pfreundschuh, our Chief Financial Officer, Carl P. LeBel, our Chief Development Officer, Dana C. Hilt, our Chief Medical Officer, Quentin McCubbin, our Chief Manufacturing Officer, Michael D. Bookman, our General Counsel, and Wendy S. Arnold, our Chief People Officer. We have also assembled a world-class team of leaders in regenerative biology, otology, drug development, and drug delivery. Our Clinical Advisory Board is comprised of leaders in hearing science and technology who shape how the community thinks about hearing function and restoration. Our Regenerative Medicine Advisory Board members are at the forefront of scientific discovery on the activation of progenitor cells and their potential application to therapeutic interventions in diseases of multiple tissues and organs. 
 Our strategy 
 We intend to create and commercialize therapeutics to potentially transform the lives of patients by repairing or reversing damage done to cells, tissue, and organs. To do so, we are implementing the following strategies: 
  
• | Advance development of a single dose regimen of FX-322 for the treatment of SNHL. We believe our lead product candidate has the potential to improve hearing function for the millions of patients affected by SNHL who currently have no therapeutic options. We now have two independent, single-dose studies in patients with mild to severe SNHL that showed a hearing signal with FX-322 and with statistically significant improvements in speech intelligibility. The interim results from our Phase 2a study demonstrated that four weekly injections in subjects with mild to moderately severe SNHL did not demonstrate improvements in hearing measures versus placebo. Therefore, we plan to advance further development of FX-322 as a single dose regimen.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish our position as a global leader in the field of hearing function. We plan to continue to grow our discovery organization and add experts in the field of otology to drive the optimization of our PCA approach for the treatment of hearing loss. We also plan to expand our presence in the field of hearing restoration and to work closely with the broader community of advocates, physicians, and payors to bring new treatments to patients globally.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the opportunities of our PCA platform beyond hearing. We believe our PCA platform has the potential to address a wide range of clinical applications. We will continue to invest in research and development to enhance our PCA platform with the goal of delivering new therapeutics in additional indications, such as diseases of the muscle, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and bone. We identified MS as a disease where PCA has the potential to produce a restorative effect by stimulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to myelinate axons. We have obtained worldwide licenses for intellectual property from Scripps and Cambridge, on approaches to promote remyelination of nerve fibers. We established an internal research program using PCA to drive remyelination as a potential therapy for MS and have identified compounds that display promising preliminary preclinical results in an in vivo model of remyelination. Our research efforts are focused on optimizing these compounds and identifying a lead therapeutic candidate to advance into clinical trials. We have obtained worldwide licenses for intellectual property from Scripps and Cambridge Enterprise on approaches to promote remyelination of nerve fibers and are engaged in sponsoring clinical research to validate this approach at Cambridge University.

• | Continue to build strategic collaborative relationships. Given the broad potential opportunity of our PCA platform, we believe entering into strategic research, development, and commercial collaborations in select therapeutic areas may provide an attractive avenue to facilitate the capital-efficient development of our PCA platform and product pipeline. We believe these strategic collaborations could potentially provide significant funding to advance our product candidates while allowing us to benefit from the development and therapeutic area expertise of our collaborators. We may collaborate with large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions to maximize the potential of our PCA platform to create new therapies for patients.

Our approach: Progenitor cell activation within the body 
 We are pioneering a new class of small molecule therapeutics designed to activate progenitor cells already present within the body to create healthy functional tissues and organs. We developed our PCA platform to identify combinations of small molecules that selectively activate progenitor cells to regenerate tissues. Our initial therapeutic focus is SNHL. We believe that our preclinical and clinical studies in SNHL have validated the potential of our PCA platform to provide a new approach to regenerative medicine. Other potential applications of our PCA platform include, but are not limited to, diseases of the muscle, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and bone. 
 The graphic below illustrates the application of our PCA platform to activate progenitor cells and create healthy functioning target cells. Our small molecules are designed to activate key genes in a progenitor cell, which enable the cell to go through asymmetric division, leaving behind a copy of the progenitor cell as well as creating a functional cell, such as a hair cell. This asymmetric division process is a common mechanism used during the natural development and repair of tissues. 
 



Relationship between stem cells and progenitor cells 
 All cells in the human body arise from a single unspecialized, or undifferentiated, cell type called a pluripotent stem cell. Two of the key characteristics of pluripotent stem cells are their ability to renew themselves through cell division and the ability to differentiate into any cell type. Progenitor cells have similar self-renewal properties as pluripotent stem cells. However, progenitor cells are programmed to develop and differentiate into specific cell types within an organ. This process can be visualized using Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, which depicts a pluripotent stem cell as a ball rolling down a hill as development progresses (see graphic below). As the ball commits to specific valleys, the cell becomes more specialized and increasingly commits to a tissue-specific fate, such as a progenitor cell. The progenitor cells are programmed to create specific cell types, and, in some cases, allow mature tissue and organs to repair and renew. However, researchers have discovered that many organs throughout the human body that do not spontaneously regenerate do contain inactive progenitor cells that, if stimulated, are potentially available to drive regeneration. 
 Over the course of several decades, multiple attempts have been made to harness the regenerative potential of stem cells. More recently, the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Dr. Shinya Yamanaka for discovering how to create induced pluripotent stem cells by adding four genetic factors to a fully differentiated cell, as illustrated by the solid black arrow in the graphic below. However, the Yamanaka factors cannot be applied in vivo, and it has proven challenging to manufacture pluripotent or other human stem cells outside of the body and to control their differentiation to

produce a particular cell type. Further, delivering and properly integrating these cells back into the body adds substantial complexity. Using another approach, some investigators have tried to force progenitor cells within the body to directly convert into other cell types through a process called trans-differentiation, as illustrated by the dotted black arrow in the graphic below. However, trans-differentiation may deplete progenitor cells, which reduces the target cell population for future treatments. 
 We believe that our PCA approach bypasses the challenges presented by stem cell therapies by utilizing small molecule therapeutics to temporarily reactivate progenitor cells that are already located at the tissue target site within the body and are pre-programmed to make specific cell types. Our combinations of small molecules are designed to induce a progenitor cell to temporarily enter an active state, where it then divides asymmetrically, replacing itself (blue arrows) and regenerating a desired cell type (orange arrow). Asymmetric division occurs when organs naturally regenerate, so progenitor cells are thought to be maintained for future use.

Key attributes of our PCA platform 
 Our discoveries in regenerative medicine allow us to activate the innate and under-utilized capabilities of progenitor cells. We believe our PCA platform represents a transformative step in the evolution of regenerative medicine by providing the following key attributes: 
  
• | Activates progenitor cells in the right location. We overcome the major challenge of delivering and integrating cells into the proper location within tissue. Our small molecule therapeutic candidates activate the body’s own progenitor cells at the desired location in targeted tissues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enables ease of manufacturing. We eliminate the need to remove and grow live cells ex vivo, which can be costly and complex to manufacture, difficult to control quality, and may pose potential safety risks. In contrast, our small molecule therapeutic candidates will be produced using standard manufacturing methods.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avoids permanent genetic changes. Instead of altering genes, our small molecules are designed to temporarily activate the innate genes that play a central role in the development of organs and tissues. This small molecule approach could create a disease-modifying or restorative effect without changing the body’s genetic code. In addition, we believe we avoid the risk of acquiring immune reactivity to our therapeutics, which is commonly associated with genetically modifying cells. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our therapeutic discovery process 
 We utilize a proprietary process to identify small molecule combinations for activating progenitor cells. 
  
• | Discovery in the right context. Traditional drug screening uses immortalized cell lines that are convenient for use in a laboratory but may not reflect the complex biology of tissue-specific cell types in the body. In our
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

discovery process, we develop primary progenitor cell assays that are designed to maintain these cells in their natural state in order to increase the likelihood of successful drug discovery and translation into an effective tissue-specific therapeutic.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decoding and controlling activation pathways for progenitor cells. We use our accumulated insights into progenitor cell signaling and aging to identify biological pathways that may activate a specific progenitor cell. We then select and apply combinations of small molecules from our proprietary toolbox of compounds to modulate the chosen biological pathways and achieve PCA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By assessing our small molecule combinations in a highly relevant context, we and our collaborators have applied this discovery process to identify compounds that activate progenitor cells in numerous tissues. 
 Our hearing program 
 We first applied our PCA platform to create FX-322, our lead product candidate designed to restore hearing function in patients with SNHL. We completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 23 patients with stable SNHL in which we observed a statistically significant improvement in WR, a key measure of hearing function, and FX-322 was observed to be well-tolerated. Specifically, thirty-three percent (33%) of these subjects achieved a ten percent (10%) or greater absolute improvement in WR scores in the treated ear. In May 2020, we shared clinical data that showed delivery of FX-322 to the cochlea at levels predicted to reach the therapeutically active range of the treatment. In September 2020, at the American Academy of Otolaryngology annual meeting, we presented data showing sustained improvements in speech intelligibility and audibility measures in patients up to 21 months after receiving an initial dose of FX-322 in our Phase 1/2 study. The Phase 1/2 and cochlear delivery study results were accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Otology and Neurotology and were published in February 2021. We believe that FX-322 has the potential to meaningfully improve overall hearing function and significantly enhance quality of life for patients with hearing loss.  
 
In October 2019, we commenced dosing in a Phase 2a clinical trial of FX-322 and the FDA granted FX-322 Fast Track designation.  The goals of the trial are to further establish the hearing signal observed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, evaluate the impact of multiple doses and provide insights on endpoints and patient population for further studies. In March 2021, we announced topline, day-90 interim data from the Phase 2a clinical trial. The results showed that four weekly injections in subjects with mild to moderately severe SNHL did not demonstrate improvements in hearing measures versus placebo. No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed in the study. In the four-arm Phase 2a study, 95 subjects aged 18-65 are being evaluated for hearing improvement using WR, Words-In-Noise, or WIN, pure tone audiometry and additional exploratory measures. All subjects were administered a total of four weekly intratympanic injections comprised of zero, one, two, or four doses of FX-322 with the balance of injections comprised of placebo doses. While our interim data showed that WR scores increased across all groups, repeated weekly injections appeared to dampen the hearing benefit observed compared to other single injection-studies. The Phase 2a interim results also showed an unexpected apparent level of hearing benefit in the placebo group that did not occur in previous trials and exceeded well-established published standards, potentially suggesting bias due to trial design. Given these challenges observed in the Phase 2a study design, the interim results showed no discernible hearing benefit of FX-322 over placebo. 
 In May 2020, we announced top-line data from an exploratory clinical study in Germany that we believe demonstrated that FX-322 effectively reached the cochlea at levels predicted, based on computer models, to be therapeutically active. Top-line results from the exploratory study showed measurable concentrations of FX-322 in every sample analyzed and that anatomical factors did not prevent FX-322 from reaching the cochlea. The study results were based on analyzing samples of cochlear fluid, known as perilymph, taken intraoperatively from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery. A total of seven patients received a single intratympanic injection of FX-322, enabling researchers to directly measure the level of FX-322 in perilymph, which is not otherwise feasible in inner-ear studies because accessing the cochlea involves an invasive surgical procedure. Study patients were followed for approximately 30 days after the procedure and no serious treatment related adverse events were observed. The study results were accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed journal Otology and Neurotology and were published in February 2021.
 In June 2020, we shared preliminary findings from a longer-term, follow-up study of certain patients that had been treated with FX-322 in the randomized portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, where we observed improvements in certain key measures of hearing loss. WR tests were performed for five patients at timepoints between 12- and 21-months following FX-322 administration. Four of the patients that were observed to have statistically significant WR scores during the Phase 1/2 clinical trial were observed to have maintained the hearing benefit, three of which remained at statistically significant levels. An additional patient who did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in WR during the Phase 1/2 clinical trial was also retested and it was observed that the WR score had returned to baseline. The results of this study were presented at the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery meeting in September 2020.

In March 2021, we announced new data from a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 designed to evaluate the impact of injection conditions on tolerability. The data showed hearing improvement from a single injection of FX-322. In the multi-center, randomized study, subjects with mild to severe SNHL (n=33) were injected in one ear with FX-322 with the untreated ear as the control. Hearing function was tested over the course of 90 days following dosing. Thirty-two (n=32) subjects completed the 90 day clinical assessment period and, at day 90 following dosing, thirty-four percent (34%) of these subjects achieved a ten percent (10%) or greater absolute improvement in WR scores in the treated ear, which was clinically meaningful and statistically significant compared to the untreated ear (p <0.05). This included a subset of subjects that more than doubled their WR scores. The single dose had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated.
 As shown in the graph below, we now have two independent, single-dose studies in patients with mild to severe SNHL that showed a hearing signal with FX-322 and with statistically significant improvements in speech intelligibility.
 


Impact and prevalence of hearing loss 
 According to the WHO, 1.5 billion people suffer from some degree of hearing loss worldwide, and, according to the NIH, more than 90% of people with hearing loss have SNHL. Based on our estimates, we believe that approximately 41 million people in the United States alone have SNHL. The WHO also estimates that 1.1 billion children and adults ages 12 to 35 years old are at risk for hearing loss from recreational noise exposure. In middle- and high-income countries, the WHO estimates that nearly 50% of people aged 12 to 35 listen to personal audio devices at unsafe sound levels. Moreover, damage from noise exposure in early childhood can render the ears more susceptible to the effects of aging. Noise exposure is difficult to avoid in modern society. Noise at restaurants, for example, routinely climbs into the high 70-decibel, or dB, range, equivalent to a canister vacuum cleaner, and sometimes to the mid-80 dB, as loud as a nearby diesel truck. 
 11


U.S. prevalence of SNHL, ranging from mild to moderate to severe, is shown in the graph below, which is from data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Each SNHL patient population is being studied in the current FX-322 clinical program. 
 


After a patient first complains of hearing loss, which is most often to their primary care physician, patients with SNHL are managed by audiologists and 
otolaryngologists, who are trained as ear, nose, and throat specialists, or ENTs. In the United States, there are about 13,000 audiologists and about 12,500 ENTs. Developing a therapeutic to potentially modify an underlying cause of SNHL may provide a critically important treatment option for this group of health-care providers and their patients. 
 There are also further direct and indirect impacts on individuals suffering from SNHL. Hearing loss profoundly affects an individual’s ability to participate in the social interactions of daily life, which can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and frustration. Untreated hearing loss is associated with a 50% increase in dementia and a 40% increase in depression. Adults with hearing loss also have higher unemployment rates than non-hearing-impaired adults, and a relationship between hearing loss and diminished employment and advancement opportunities has been reported. According to a 2020 study in the medical journal The Lancet, hearing loss is the largest modifiable risk factor for developing dementia.

Biology and measurement of hearing 
 As shown in the figure below, we hear sounds when sound waves enter the inner ear and generate movement of the fluid in the cochlea, a portion of the inner ear that looks like a snail shell. This fluid movement causes hair cells within the cochlea to bend and in turn generate electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve. The cochlea is arranged so that hair cells at the base detect high frequencies and hair cells at the apex detect low frequencies. 
 

Humans are born with about 15,000 hair cells in the cochlea of each ear. Hair cells are commonly lost due to noise exposure in work settings, travel or leisure activities, or as a result of aging, certain viral infections or exposure to ototoxic drugs. Lost hair cells do not spontaneously regenerate. Over time, hearing loss can accumulate with greater prevalence at high frequencies. The left panel of the figure below shows a picture of the inside of a healthy cochlea, with one row of inner hair cells, or IHCs, and three rows of outer hair cells, or OHCs. OHCs amplify or dampen sound volume and tune the cochlea to detect specific frequencies. IHCs convert sound waves into nerve impulses that are sent to the auditory nerve. Functional hair cells allow the auditory system to focus on a sound and filter it appropriately throughout the cochlea.

The two primary components for hearing testing are intelligibility, or the ability to understand spoken words, and the audibility or loudness of sound. While amplifying devices such as hearing aids can make sounds louder, they have limited ability to improve intelligibility, particularly in noisy environments. Intelligibility is particularly important to understand speech in social settings such as in meetings or at restaurants, where filtering sound is critical for communication. 
 13


Intelligibility is typically measured by playing a list of words that are repeated back by the person being tested and scoring based on the number of words that the person gets correct. The two validated testing methods of speech intelligibility that are most widely used by audiologists are: word recognition, or WR, where patients are asked to identify monosyllabic words delivered at a loud, but conversational volume level, and words-in-noise, or WIN, where patients are asked to identify monosyllabic words in the presence of background, multi-talker noise. 
 
Audibility is determined by measuring hearing function at different levels of loudness and pitch or frequency. Patients are most often tested using pure tone audiometry, in which a tone is played at a particular frequency and patients are asked to indicate whether they can hear the tone at varying levels of loudness. Loudness is recorded in dB HL. Frequency is recorded in Hertz, or Hz, and is generally measured in the range of 250 to 8000 Hz. According to the WHO, normal hearing is defined as the ability to hear sounds at a loudness value of less than 26 dB HL, which is the average of loudness values measured at a range of low, middle, and high frequencies, such as 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. The larger the loudness value needed for a patient to hear sounds the greater the decline in hearing function, or more severe hearing loss. The graphic below depicts the severity of hearing loss across a range of frequencies based on the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association scale. 
 


Limitations of current treatment options 
 Current treatment options for hearing loss have significant limitations and none are disease modifying. The only available treatments for hearing loss are hearing aids, or in extreme cases, cochlear implants. No drug therapies have been approved by the FDA or, to our knowledge, by other regulatory bodies, for the treatment of SNHL. 
 Hearing aids 
 Hearing aids help many patients cope with mild-to-moderate hearing loss and are used or have been tried by more than 10 million patients in the United States. Only one in four patients with hearing loss has ever used hearing aids, and approximately half of patients who seek medical assistance for their hearing loss do not get hearing aids.  Limitations of hearing aids include: 
  
• | Poor sound quality. Hearing aids amplify sounds, allowing patients to perceive sounds that would otherwise be too soft for them to hear, but do not address the loss of hair cells, which determine sound quality and intelligibility, particularly in noisy environments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Challenges in social settings. The wide range of frequencies and sharp tuning provided by hair cells enables the auditory system to accurately recognize and distinguish different sounds, allowing the brain to focus on a single sound source. Hearing aids on the other hand typically amplify all sounds and do not enable this important

sound-processing capability. As a result, interactions in social settings, which require distinguishing one speaker among many sound sources, are significantly impaired.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulties with background noise. Patients with hearing loss may become more sensitive to background noise, and many patients with hearing aids turn them off in noisy environments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stigma associated with wearing a visible device. Some patients refuse to wear hearing aids, or do not wear them regularly, as they do not want to be stigmatized or identified as having a physical handicap.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Need for maintenance. Hearing aids must be replaced, on average, every four to six years, need regular battery replacement, and can require repair due to damage during use. Medicare and most private insurance plans do not pay for hearing aids, and most patients must pay for these devices out of pocket.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cochlear Implants 
 Patients with severe or profound hearing loss who have not been helped by hearing aids may be candidates for a cochlear implant. Of the roughly one million people in the United States who qualify, only about 100,000 patients have cochlear implants. Cochlear implants comprise an external microphone, sound processor and transmitter system, which receive sounds from the environment, and an implanted receiver and electrode system that directly stimulates the auditory nerve. Cochlear implants do not mimic natural hearing, and patients with cochlear implants need to learn to interpret the low-resolution electric signal produced by the device as sound. Cochlear implants also require an invasive, costly surgical procedure. 
 Our lead product candidate: FX-322 
 Using our PCA platform, we are developing our lead product candidate, FX-322, for the treatment of SNHL. FX-322 is designed to treat the underlying cause of SNHL by regenerating hair cells through activation of progenitor cells already present in the cochlea. We believe that FX-322 has the potential to meaningfully improve overall hearing function and significantly enhance quality of life for patients with hearing loss. 
 Mechanism of Action 
 By studying the most regenerative organ in the body, the intestine, we discovered that signaling for proliferation and differentiation among stem cells could be replicated with small molecules. Specifically, activating the Wnt pathway, which is fundamental for cell growth, using a glycogen synthase kinase 3, or GSK3, inhibitor and inhibiting histone deacetylase, or HDAC, caused intestinal stem cells expressing the protein Lgr5 to proliferate. The inner ear contains progenitor cells with the Lgr5 protein that do not regenerate on their own. On the hypothesis that these progenitor cells lacked the signals required for regeneration, we applied a GSK3 inhibitor and HDAC inhibitor to these cells and found that they proliferated and regenerated lost hair cells. Based on this discovery, we created FX-322, which is a proprietary combination of an FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, sodium valproate, and a new chemical entity that inhibits GSK3. 
Administration 
 FX-322 is our proprietary thermoreversible polymer formulation that is administered through the eardrum, or intratympanically, into the middle ear in a procedure that takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The intratympanic administration procedure is generally well-tolerated and is routinely performed by ENTs as an office-based procedure. FX-322, which is liquid at room temperature, gels at body temperature inside the middle ear, allowing the active ingredients to diffuse into the inner ear and reach the cochlea. Similar thermoreversible polymer formulations have been used in FDA-approved products for other indications in the ear. 
 15


The image below shows delivery of FX-322 via intratympanic injection. 
 

Preclinical studies 
 Prior to commencing clinical trials, we tested FX-322 in multiple preclinical studies, including in human cells ex vivo and functional hearing tests in mice in vivo. In in vitro testing of isolated human inner ear progenitor cells with the compounds comprising FX-322, we observed the formation of new progenitor cells and their subsequent conversion into hair cells. We also observed translation across species in our in vitro studies of the inner ear progenitor cells from rhesus macaques in which a similar expansion of cell numbers were observed as in the in vitro studies of human cells.
We also conducted ex vivo testing in intact cochlea isolated from mice. To cause hair cell loss, we exposed the cochlea for 16 hours to an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is toxic to hair cells. We then treated the cochlea for 72 hours with the compounds comprising the active agents in FX-322. Aminoglycoside treatment (left panel in the figure below) killed more than 80% of the hair cells in the cochlea (shown in green). By contrast, cochlea treated with the compounds in FX-322 (shown in the right panel) regenerated hair cells to a near native level, as shown graphically in the right panel. 
 Restoration of Hair Cells in Mouse Cochlea

We also tested FX-322 in a mouse model of severe noise-induced hearing loss. Following noise exposure, 47 mice were treated with FX-322 and 37 were treated with placebo. Hearing function was measured using auditory brainstem response, or ABR, in which the signal generated by the auditory nerve upon sensing sound is detected by electrodes on the scalp. We performed ABR testing after 24 hours, and measured hearing recovery after 30 days. The figure below shows the percentage of mice treated with FX-322 (shown in orange) or with placebo (shown in blue) that achieved a hearing recovery of at least 10 dB at 20000 Hz, a mid-range frequency for mice. The improvement observed in the placebo-treated mice was due to recovery of temporary effects not related to hair cell death, which is typical following acute hearing loss. 
Hearing Recovery in Mice Treated with FX-322 
 

We have also conducted pharmacokinetic tests in multiple species in which we observed that FX-322 administration achieved therapeutic levels of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the cochlea. 
 
Clinical results 
 Phase 1/2 clinical trial 
 We conducted a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FX-322 in which we enrolled 23 adult patients aged 33 to 64 with an established diagnosis of mild to moderately severe stable SNHL, defined as the average pure tone value of 26 to 70 dB at the 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz frequencies, who had no change of 10 db or more at any frequency for more than six months. Fourteen patients had mild SNHL and nine patients had moderate to moderately severe SNHL. Of the nine moderate to moderately severe patients, six were randomized to FX-322 and three to placebo. In this trial, 15 patients were treated with a single injection of FX-322 and eight patients received placebo. Each patient had a documented medical history consistent with either noise-induced hearing loss, or NIHL, typically from noise exposure at work, or sudden SNHL, or SSNHL, which is characterized as a loss of 30 dB at three adjacent frequencies occurring over a 72-hour period. All patients had stable SNHL, meaning their hearing function at study entry was not significantly different based on a documented audiogram from at least six months prior to the study. Hearing function, specifically speech intelligibility, was assessed using WR and WIN. Hearing loudness was also measured using pure tone audiometry. Patients were randomized to a single injection of FX-322 or placebo administered at one of two different dose volumes (0.05 mL and 0.2 mL) to assess the safety of FX-322 administration and systemic exposure to FX-322. Follow-up visits occurred at 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after injection. 
 17


The objectives of the trial were to assess: 
  
• | the systemic safety of FX-322;
--+-------------------------------


• | the plasma pharmacokinetic profile to determine the systemic exposure to FX-322; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of FX-322 on measures of ear health and hearing function.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 FX-322 was observed to be well-tolerated in this trial. No serious adverse events were observed, and all treatment-related adverse events were mild, procedure-related, and generally resolved within minutes after dosing. We also observed limited concentrations of the FX-322 components in systemic circulation. 
 In addition to the prospective analysis, we conducted a prospective statistical analysis where we tested whether the Day 90 WR value for each patient fell outside of the 95% confidence interval compared to their baseline WR value. A confidence interval, or CI, is a range of values in which, statistically, there is a specified level of confidence where the result lies. In this patient-by-patient analysis, we observed statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in WR in four of 15 patients treated with FX-322 at Day 90, who were among the six FX-322 patients that had moderate to moderately severe SNHL (as shown in the figure below).We also observed improvements for the two remaining FX-322 patients in the study that had moderate to moderately severe SNHL in the range of 30-50% from their baseline score, but these improvements were not statistically significant.
 In June 2020, we shared preliminary findings from a follow-up study we conducted that assessed durability of the WR improvements beyond 90 days at a single follow-up visit from 407 to 639 days post-FX-322 administration in five of the subjects that showed a response in the Phase 1/2 trial (the 6th patient was unable to participate in the follow-up study). The mean percentage of words correct in the treated ear was 38.4% at baseline, 69.6% at day 90, and 54.8% at follow-up. Three of five subjects showed statistically significant improvements in WR at the follow-up visit compared to baseline (see following figure). We believe that the results suggest that a single dose of FX-322 can result in durable improvements in speech intelligibility and support further investigation of the efficacy of FX-322.
 

There was no apparent association between WR improvements and whether the patients had stable NIHL, or stable SSNHL, and similar results were obtained with both dose volumes. This is consistent with published work showing drug delivery to the cochlea depends more on the concentration of the drug than the volume of injection. There were no clinically meaningful WR improvements observed in the placebo group. 
 


We also performed a post hoc analysis on WR and WIN data for the Phase 1/2 study. The analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in WR by all FX-322-treated patients versus all placebo patients (p=0.010). A p value is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance. The smaller the p value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p value is less than or equal to 0.05, the outcome is statistically significant. The data in the figures below are presented as adjusted mean relative percent change from baseline. FX-322 treated patients saw improvements in WR as early as 15 days after treatment that were sustained over 90 days. 
 18


As shown in the figure below for WIN, the adjusted mean relative percent change from baseline was assessed at 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after injection, and a trend in improvement was seen in FX-322-treated patients versus placebo. Also, there were non-statistically significant trends in improved WIN scores at Day 90 in the four FX-322, treated patients that had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in WR in the prospective statistical analysis. 
 

The same WR data was published in Otology and Neurotology in February 2021, as shown in the figure below. In compliance with the publication’s policy, the data was presented with standard error, resulting in a slightly different adjusted mean and p value. Despite the change, the results were consistent with the figure above. 
 

19


As shown in the figure below, published in Otology and Neurotology in February 2021, speech recognition in a noisy background also improved over time for FX-322-treated patients versus placebo patients. Performance was quantified as the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR, consistent with 50% correct WR, with lower SNR values indicating better speech perception in background noise. Analyses showed a significant improvement in average SNR from baseline to Day 90 in FX-322-treated patients versus placebo patients. 
 

We also assessed audiometric changes from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz for all patients. Since drug enters closest to the high frequency region, the greatest drug exposure is expected to occur in the high frequency region. While no statistical differences were observed at any frequency when comparing pooled treatment groups, four of the moderate to moderately severe FX-322 patients showed a 10 dB threshold improvement at 8000 Hz at Day 90.
 Phase 2a clinical trial 
 Based on our analysis of the data from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and repeat-dose Phase 2a clinical trial of FX-322 in the fourth quarter of 2019. In September 2020, we completed enrollment of 95 patients across 16 sites in the Phase 2a clinical trial. As in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, patients were required to have a documented medical history consistent with either stable NIHL or stable SSNHL, meaning that a patient’s hearing deficit has remained consistent over a defined period of time based on a patient’s audiograms. All subjects in the clinical trial have meaningful WR deficits including patients who are considered to have “mild” hearing loss. 
 To explore how a single dose compares to multiple doses of FX-322, we randomized patients to one of four groups, each of which received four injections, once per week at weekly intervals starting at the initial visit. Group 1 received one injection of FX-322 and three injections of placebo. Group two received two injections of FX-322 and two injections of placebo. Group three received four injections of FX-322. Group four received four injections of placebo. Patients have follow-up visits two weeks after dosing and then monthly for seven months. The efficacy endpoints of this trial are WR, WIN, and pure tone audiometry in the range of 250 to 8000 Hz. The exploratory efficacy endpoints are the TFI, the HHIA, and pure tone audiometry in the range of 9000 to 16000 Hz. The selection of the efficacy endpoints in this study builds on the learnings from the Phase 1/2 trial, and we believe will add to our knowledge on the potential ways in which FX-322 may improve hearing function. 
 In March 2021, we announced topline, day-90 interim data from the Phase 2a clinical trial. The results showed that four weekly injections in subjects with mild to moderately severe SNHL did not demonstrate improvements in hearing measures versus placebo. No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed in the study. In the four-arm Phase 2a study, 95 subjects aged 18-65 were evaluated for hearing improvement using WR, WIN, pure tone audiometry and additional exploratory measures. All subjects were administered a total of four weekly intratympanic injections comprised of zero, one, two, or four doses of FX-322 with the balance of injections comprised of placebo doses. While WR scores increased across all groups, the interim data showed that repeated weekly injections appeared to dampen the hearing benefit observed compared to other single injection-studies. The Phase 2a interim results also showed an unexpected apparent level of hearing 
 20


benefit in the placebo group that did not occur in previous trials and exceeded well-established published standards, potentially suggesting bias due to trial design. Given these challenges observed in the Phase 2a study design, there was no discernible hearing benefit of FX-322 over placebo. We plan to report an analysis of the end of Phase 2a data (210 days) late in the second quarter of 2021.
Phase 1b clinical studies
 In March 2021, we announced new data from a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 designed to evaluate the impact of injection conditions on tolerability. The results showed hearing improvement from a single injection of FX-322. In the multi-center, randomized study, subjects with mild to severe SNHL (n=33) were injected in one ear with FX-322 with the untreated ear as the control. Hearing function was tested over the course of 90 days following dosing. Thirty-two (n=32) subjects completed the 90 day clinical assessment period and, at day 90 following dosing, thirty-four percent (34%) of these subjects achieved a ten percent (10%) or greater absolute improvement in WR scores in the treated ear, which was clinically meaningful and statistically significant compared to the untreated ear (p <0.05). This included a subset of subjects that more than doubled their WR scores. The single dose had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated.
 We commenced a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 for age-related hearing loss in October 2020. The clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized multicenter safety study of up to 30 individuals aged 66-85 with mild to moderately severe age-related hearing loss. The primary objectives of the Phase 1b study are to assess the local and systemic safety of a single dose of FX-322 and evaluate hearing responses in an older adult cohort. Study participants will be randomized 4:1 to receive either FX-322 or placebo in one ear. Validated measures of hearing including WR, WIN, and pure tone audiometry will be used. Safety, otologic and audiologic assessments will be conducted at day 30 and 90 following administration of FX-322 or placebo. We expect to share results from this clinical trial in the second quarter of 2021.
 We commenced a Phase 1b clinical trial of FX-322 in patients aged 18-65 with severe SNHL in November 2020. Severe SNHL is defined as a pure tone average deficit between 71-90 dB. Many patients with this clinical profile typically would be candidates for cochlear implants. This clinical trial employs a similar design to the age-related Phase 1b clinical trial that is currently underway. We expect to share results from this clinical trial in the third quarter of 2021.
 Other Clinical Studies
 In May 2020, we announced top-line data from an exploratory clinical study in Germany that we believe demonstrated that FX-322 effectively reached the cochlea at levels predicted, based on computer models, to be therapeutically active. Top-line results from the exploratory study showed measurable concentrations of FX-322 in every sample analyzed and that anatomical factors did not prevent FX-322 from reaching the cochlea. The study results were based on analyzing samples of cochlear fluid, known as perilymph, taken intraoperatively from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery. A total of seven patients received a single intratympanic injection of FX-322, enabling researchers to directly measure the level of FX-322 in perilymph, which is not otherwise feasible in inner-ear studies because accessing the cochlea involves an invasive surgical procedure. Study patients were followed for approximately 30 days after the procedure and no serious treatment related adverse events were observed. The study results were included in the article accepted for publication in the journal Otology and Neurotology and were published in February 2021.
 Our multiple sclerosis (MS) program 
 We have initiated a discovery and preclinical program in MS after identifying MS as a degenerative disease that has the potential to be treated with small molecules that activate oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, or OPCs, leading to remyelination. In 2017, we initiated a relationship with Scripps, where researchers had discovered that anti-muscarinic and other classes of pharmacologic agents activate OPCs in the brain. We are pursuing this and other approaches to stimulating myelination of axons in MS. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for making myelin, which accelerates the conduction of information through the brain and provides metabolic support for axons. We believe that stimulating progenitor cells in the central nervous system to grow oligodendrocytes and remyelinate axons could potentially reverse the damage caused by the immune system in MS. The presently approved therapies for MS suppress demyelination but do not repair the damage to myelin.
 The potential for anti-muscarinic drugs to treat the symptoms of MS was supported by an independently-run, double-blinded Phase 2 cross-over study entitled Clemastine Fumarate as a Remyelinating Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis (ReBUILD), conducted at the University of California, San Francisco. In the ReBUILD study, 50 adult, relapsing-remitting MS patients with optic neuropathy were randomized to either clemastine, which has anti-muscarinic and anti-histaminic activity, or placebo, both in combination with standard of care. The primary endpoint of the study was visual evoked potential latency, or VEP, a test commonly used for optic neuritis and other demyelinating events, such as MS. Patients 
 21


treated with clemastine showed an improvement in VEPs indicating remyelination of optic nerve axons. The results of this study were published in the medical journal The Lancet and showed a statistically significant improvement in VEP in patients treated using a single agent, clemastine. Other agents which have been reported to show remyelinating activity in MS patients include a Histamine receptor 3 (H3) inverse agonist and Bexarotene (an RXR antagonist). In all of the above studies the remyelinating effects were reported based on measures of nerve function (electrophysiology) or imaging (MRI imaging).  These methods are considered to be measures or biomarkers of the degree of remyelination, supporting the idea that remyelination may be possible in MS patients.   
 
We have been applying our expertise in finding synergistic combinations of small molecules for activating progenitor cells to the treatment of MS. We believe that combinations of the agents may be more active than single agents such as clemastine. The increased remyelination activity may lead to a clinical benefit in patients with MS. We have licensed the worldwide rights to the related Scripps patent estate and are continuing to advance this discovery both on our own and through a sponsored research arrangement with Scripps. Through this work we have discovered combinations that enhance both in vitro and in vivo remyelination over single agents, and have obtained a worldwide, exclusive license from Cambridge for one such combination. We established an internal research program using PCA to drive remyelination as a potential therapy for MS and have identified compounds that display promising preliminary preclinical results in an in vivo model of remyelination. Our research efforts are focused on optimizing these compounds and identifying a lead therapeutic candidate to advance into clinical trials. We have obtained worldwide licenses for intellectual property from Scripps and Cambridge Enterprise on approaches to promote remyelination of nerve fibers and are engaged in sponsoring clinical research to validate this approach at Cambridge University. 
 In 2020 we established an internal research and discovery effort to identify novel compounds that activate OPCs and induce remyelination in animal models of MS. The goal of the program is to identify product candidates that are novel and that show significantly more remyelination activity than existing remyelination agents.
 Overview of multiple sclerosis 
 According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, nearly one million people in the United States are living with MS. The symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling, weakness, dizziness and vertigo, spasticity, vision problems, sexual problems, bladder or bowel problems, pain, cognitive changes, emotional changes, and depression. Most MS is initially relapsing-remitting MS in which patients experience periods of new or relapsing symptoms followed by recovery and periods of remission. Early in the disease course, the patients are able to remyelinate the demyelinated nerves at least in part. As the disease progresses the ability of the body to remyelinate axons significantly decreases. This leads to progressive and irreversible neurological deficits.
 
The FDA has approved a number of disease-modifying therapies for MS that reduce the immune system attack on myelin, which may reduce the number of relapses, delay progression of disability, and limit new disease activity. However, none of these products repair the central nervous system or lead to remyelination of the nerve fibers, and there is no cure for MS. There are no FDA approved remyelinating therapies for MS. Our program aims to induce OPCs to become functional myelinating oligodendrocytes leading to myelin repair.
 Leveraging our PCA platform for future applications 
 In addition to our hearing and MS programs, we believe our PCA platform has the potential to address a wide range of clinical applications. In directing our internal research, research collaborations, and in-licensing efforts, we intend to target areas of high unmet medical need for which the underlying disease process involves loss or degeneration of key cells that could be reversed using PCA. We believe the PCA platform could further be applied to diseases of the muscle, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and bone. We intend to continue to identify areas with high unmet need where our PCA platform and novel approach to regenerative medicine could lead to potentially disease-modifying therapeutics that create healthy functional tissues and improve patients’ lives. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our product candidates consist of small chemical compounds to stimulate cell and tissue regeneration in vivo. As a result, we can rely on the well-established and available manufacturing and drug-delivery technologies developed over decades by the pharmaceutical industry. We source our active pharmaceutical ingredients from contract manufacturers with a track record of FDA-compliant manufacturing. After rigorous internal and external quality control testing, we release these materials to additional contract manufacturers for formulation and packaging into final drug product for use in clinical testing. We expect to use a similar hybrid of internal and contract resources for commercialization of our products, at least until our operations reach a scale sufficient to justify investment in internal manufacturing capacity. 
 22


Commercialization 
 We intend to directly market and commercialize our lead product candidate, FX-322 for the treatment of SNHL, if approved in the United States, by developing our own sales and marketing force, targeting ENTs and audiologists. Under the Astellas Agreement, Astellas has the right to market and commercialize FX-322 for the treatment of SNHL, and any other products containing both a GSK-3 inhibitor and an HDAC inhibitor if approved, outside of the United States. For any other product candidates that are not part of the Astellas Agreement and that may be approved, we intend to establish marketing and commercialization strategies for each as we approach potential approval and expect to be able to leverage our then-existing sales and marketing force. 
 Intellectual property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in our field. 
 Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular our patent rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating, or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products identical or similar to ours may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. 
 The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also cannot ensure that patents will issue with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
 In an effort to secure our intellectual property positions we generally file patent applications directed to our programs.  As of March 19, 2021, we owned, licensed, or have an option to license 38 patent families.  These patent families include 6 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, 22 U.S. patents, 35 ex-U.S. patents, 83 pending ex-U.S. patent applications, and 27 pending U.S. utility applications. 
 The intellectual property portfolio for our lead programs as of February 28, 2021, are summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be significantly narrowed before issuance, if issued at all. We expect this may be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below. 
 Hearing loss 
 The patent portfolio for our Hearing Loss program is based upon our owned and in-licensed patent families that include patents and patent applications directed generally to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of using the same to treat hearing loss; and specifically directed to compositions of matter of our lead product FX-322, pharmaceutical compositions of FX-322 and methods of using the same to treat hearing loss. The in-licensed patents and patent applications are subject to license agreements with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary described herein. As of March 19, 2021, we have rights to, through ownership and in-licensing, 31 patent families, including 17 U.S. patents, 32 ex-U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. utility patent applications, 65 pending ex-U.S. patent applications, and 5 pending PCT applications relate to treating hearing loss, both generally and related to FX-322. While we believe that the specific and generic claims contained in our issued U.S. patents provide protection for the composition of matter and the method of using FX-322 to treat hearing loss and/or diseases associated with the absence or lack of certain tissue cells, third parties may nevertheless challenge such claims in our patents. If any such claims are invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason, we will lose valuable intellectual property rights, and our ability to prevent others from competing with us would be impaired. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patents that may issue from pending applications that we control,

if any, for our hearing program, including our lead product FX-322, are projected to have a statutory expiration date in between 2035 and 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, if applicable.
 Multiple sclerosis program 
 We plan to use a similar intellectual property strategy when building protection with respect to other programs. Within our MS program, we advise on a portfolio of intellectual property directed to the treatment of MS, through ownership and exclusive in-licensing from Scripps and Cambridge Enterprise. As of March 19, 2021, no development candidate has been designated, but the intellectual property portfolio for our MS research program currently includes 4 patent families including 3 U.S. patents, 3 ex-U.S. patents, 4 pending U.S. utility patent applications, and 11 ex-U.S. patent applications. While we believe that the specific and generic claims, contained in our U.S. and ex-U.S. patents provide protection for the claimed pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use third parties may nevertheless challenge such claims. If any such claims are invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason, we will lose valuable intellectual property rights, and our ability to prevent others from competing with us would be impaired. Any U.S. or ex-U.S. patents that may issue from pending applications that we control, if any, for our MS are projected to have a statutory expiration date between 2032 and 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering the use of products from our intellectual property may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our use of drug candidates or the drug candidate itself receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved use or drug candidate. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors, and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of inventions. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property. 
 License and collaboration agreements 
 Astellas Pharma Inc. 
 In July 2019, we entered into the Astellas Agreement with Astellas, under which we granted Astellas an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sub-licensable, nontransferable license to certain patent rights to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, seek and secure regulatory approval for, commercialize, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import, and otherwise exploit licensed products containing both a GSK-3 inhibitor and an HDAC inhibitor, or the Astellas licensed 
 24


products, including our product candidate FX-322, outside of the United States. We also granted Astellas a right of first negotiation and a right of last refusal if we enter into any negotiation or agreement of any kind (other than an acquisition of all of our stock or assets) with any third party under which such third party would obtain the right to develop, manufacture, or commercialize Astellas licensed products in the United States. 
 We and Astellas have agreed to jointly develop the Astellas licensed products, including potentially carrying out joint studies. Each party has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out development activities assigned to it under an agreed-upon development plan. Astellas has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval for at least one Astellas licensed product in SNHL and in age-related hearing loss, in each case, in one major Asian country and one major European country. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval for at least one Astellas licensed product in the United States. Astellas has the sole right to commercialize the Astellas licensed products outside of the United States, and we have the sole right to commercialize the Astellas licensed products in the United States. Astellas has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Astellas licensed products in a major Asian country and a major European country following receipt of regulatory approval in such countries. 
 As consideration for the licensed rights under the Astellas agreement, Astellas paid us an upfront payment of $80.0 million in July 2019 and has agreed to pay potential development milestone payments up to $230.0 million. Specifically, we would receive development milestone payments of $65.0 million and $25.0 million upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase 2b clinical trial for SNHL in Europe and Asia, respectively, and $100.0 million and $40.0 million upon the first dosing of a patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial for SNHL in Europe and Asia, respectively.  If the Astellas licensed products are successfully commercialized, we would be eligible for up to $315.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments and also tiered royalties at rates ranging from low- to mid-teen percentages.
 The Astellas Agreement remains in effect until the expiration of all royalty obligations. Royalties are paid on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patent rights with respect to such Astellas licensed product in such country or (ii) a set number of years from the first commercial sale of such Astellas licensed product in such country. Astellas may terminate the Astellas Agreement at will upon 60 days’ written notice. Each party has the right to terminate the Astellas Agreement due to the other party’s material breach if such breach remains uncured for 90 days (or 45 days in the case of nonpayment) or if the other party becomes bankrupt. 
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
 In December 2016, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement, or the MIT License, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain patent rights to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, and import products, or the MIT licensed products, and to develop and perform processes, or the MIT licensed processes, which incorporate the licensed technology for the treatment of disease, including, but not limited to, the prevention and remediation of hearing loss. We also have the right to grant sublicenses under the MIT License. MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital retain the right on behalf of themselves and all other nonprofit research institutions to practice the licensed patent rights for nonclinical research, teaching, and educational purposes. 
 We are required to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the MIT licensed products or processes and to make such products or processes reasonably available to the public. We are also subject to certain development obligations with regards to a first MIT licensed product. We have satisfied certain obligations related to preclinical and clinical studies and the filing of an IND for a first MIT licensed product with our development activities related to FX-322. Our future development obligations are: (i) to commence a Phase III clinical trial for such product within five years of the IND filing for such product, (ii) to file a New Drug Application, or NDA, or equivalent with the FDA or comparable European regulatory agency for such product within nine years of the IND filing for such product, and (iii) to make a first commercial sale of such product within 11 years of the IND filing for such product. We also have certain development obligations with regards to a second MIT licensed product. If we fail to meet our development obligations, other than those relating to a second MIT licensed product, MIT may terminate the MIT License. In the event that we have failed to fulfill our development timeline obligation with respect to a second MIT licensed product and fail to cure such breach within 90 days of written notice by MIT, MIT may restrict the licensed field to the prevention and remediation of hearing loss in humans and animals. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and our rights to enforce the in-licensed patents are subject to certain limitations. 
 Upon entering the MIT License, we paid a $50 thousand license fee payment and issued to MIT shares of our common stock equal to 5% of our then-outstanding capital stock. We are required to pay certain annual license maintenance fees ranging from $30 thousand to $0.1 million per year prior to first commercial sale of a MIT licensed product and an annual 
 25


license maintenance fee of $0.2 million every year afterwards, which may be credited to running royalties during the same calendar year, if any. We are also required to make potential milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to $2.9 million on each MIT licensed product or process. In addition, we agreed to pay a low single-digit royalty on the MIT licensed products and processes and a 20% royalty on sub-license revenues. In 2019, we paid MIT $16.0 million dollars representing the royalty on the upfront payment received from Astellas.
 The MIT License will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all licensed issued patents and filed patent applications, unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate for any reason upon three months’ prior written notice. MIT has the right to terminate immediately if we cease to carry on any business related to the MIT License. MIT may also terminate the MIT License for our material breach if such breach remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days in the case of nonpayment). MIT may also terminate the MIT License if we or our affiliates commence any action against MIT to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid, unpatentable, unenforceable, or not infringed, or if our sub-licensee commences such actions and we do not terminate such sub-license within 30 days after MIT’s demand. MIT has the right to increase all payments due by us, instead of terminating the MIT License in the case of a patent challenge. 
 In May 2019, the MIT License was amended to update the diligence milestones for a second MIT licensed product. 
 Massachusetts Eye and Ear (Formerly Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary) 
 In February 2019, we entered into an Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement, or the MEE License, with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear, or MEE, under which we received a non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain patent rights to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease and import products and to develop and perform processes that incorporate the licensed technology for the treatment or prevention of hearing loss, or the MEE licensed products. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the MEE licensed products. We met one of our milestone timeline obligations by dosing a first patient in a Phase II trial by December 31, 2020. We are still subject to a milestone timeline obligation to dose a first patient in a Phase III trial by December 31, 2024. We do not control the filing, prosecution, enforcement, and defense of any licensed patent rights. 
 Upon entering the MEE License, we made a $20 thousand license fee payment. We are obligated to pay certain annual license maintenance fees between $5 thousand and $7.5 thousand per each MEE patent family case number included in the licensed MEE patent rights prior to first commercial sale of an MEE licensed product. We are also obligated to pay a minimum annual royalty payment of $15 thousand per each MEE patent family case number included in the licensed MEE patent rights after first commercial sale of an MEE licensed product. We are also obligated to make milestone payments up to $350 thousand on each product or process that incorporates the licensed patent rights. In addition, we have agreed to pay a low single-digit royalty on products and processes that incorporate the licensed patent rights. 
 The MEE License remains in effect until all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patent rights have expired or been abandoned, unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate the MEE License at will by 30 business days’ advance written notice to MEE. MEE has the right to terminate the MEE License (i) if we fail to make any payment due within 30 business days after MEE notifies us of such failure, (ii) if we fail to maintain required insurance, (iii) upon 45 business days’ written notice if we become insolvent, or (iv) for any other default by us that is not cured within 60 business days of receipt of written notice. MEE also has the right to terminate if we or our affiliates challenge the validity of the licensed patent rights. 
 The Scripps Research Institute (California Institute for Biomedical Research) 
 In September 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the CALIBR License, with the California Institute for Biomedical Research, or CALIBR, a division of Scripps, under which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, and import products, or the CALIBR licensed products, which incorporate licensed technology for the treatment of MS. We also have the right to grant sublicenses under the CALIBR License. CALIBR reserves the right to use for itself and the right to grant nonexclusive licenses to other nonprofit or academic institutions for any internal research and educational purposes. 
 We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and sell at least one CALIBR licensed product. We are also subject to certain milestone timeline obligations, which may be extended in certain circumstances as set forth in the CALIBR License to: (i) submit an IND (or equivalent) for a CALIBR licensed product by the 30th month after the effective date of the CALIBR License, (ii) initiate a Phase II clinical trial (or equivalent) for a CALIBR licensed product by the fourth anniversary of the effective date of the CALIBR License, and (iii) initiate a Phase III clinical trial (or 
 26


equivalent) for a CALIBR licensed product by the sixth anniversary of the effective date of the CALIBR License. We do not have the right to control prosecution of the in-licensed patent applications, and our rights to enforce the in-licensed patents are subject to certain limitations. 
 Upon entering the CALIBR license, we made a $1.0 million license fee payment, and are required to make milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to $26.0 million for each category of CALIBR licensed products. Category 1 is any CALIBR licensed products containing a compound that modulates any muscarinic receptor, and Category 2 is any CALIBR licensed products not included in Category 1 that could differentiate oligodendrocyte precursor cells from in vitro studies and/or are active in animal models relevant to MS. We are also required to pay a mid-single-digit royalty on CALIBR licensed products and a royalty on sub-license revenues ranging from a low-teen percentage to 50%. 
 The CALIBR License continues in effect until expiration of all our obligations to pay royalties. Royalties are payable by us on a country-by-country and licensed-product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (i) the expiration or abandonment of all valid claims of the licensed patent rights in such country and (ii) 10 years from the first commercial sale of each CALIBR licensed product in such country. We may terminate the CALIBR License at will upon 30 days’ prior written notice. We may also elect to terminate our license to one or more licensed patents in any or all jurisdictions by giving 90 days’ prior written notice to CALIBR. CALIBR may terminate the CALIBR License for our material breach if such breach remains uncured for 30 days. CALIBR has the right to terminate or reduce the license to a non-exclusive license if we fail to use diligent efforts to develop and commercially exploit CALIBR licensed products. 
 The Scripps Research Institute 
 In September 2018, we entered into a Research Funding and Option Agreement, or the Scripps option agreement, with Scripps, under which we were granted an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain intellectual property related to the treatment of MS. If we exercise such option, the CALIBR License shall be amended to include such intellectual property. 
 As consideration for the Scripps option agreement, we are required to make funding payments totaling $0.7 million to Scripps to support its research activities. Scripps has agreed to use reasonable efforts to perform the research program pursuant to the Scripps option agreement. The Scripps option agreement had a one-year term and was renewed for a second year by mutual written agreement.
 In September 2020, we extended the term of the Scripps option agreement through the end of December 2021. As consideration for this extension, we are required to make additional funding payments of $0.6 million to Scripps through December 2021. We have the right to terminate by giving 90 days’ advance written notice. Scripps has the right to terminate in the event of nonpayment by us that remains uncured for 10 days. Each party has the right to terminate in the event of the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 60 days or if the other party becomes bankrupt. 
 Cambridge Enterprise Limited 
 In December 2019, we entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement, or the Cambridge License, with Cambridge, under which we received an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, and import products, or the Cambridge licensed products, which incorporate licensed technology for the treatment of demyelinating diseases. We also have the right to grant sublicenses under the Cambridge License. Cambridge reserves the right to use for itself (as well as for the inventors and the funder) and the right to grant nonexclusive licenses to other academic institutions for any academic publication, research and teaching and clinical patient care. 
 We have agreed to use diligent and good faith efforts to develop and commercially exploit at least one Cambridge licensed product. Upon entering into the Cambridge License, we made a $50.0 thousand license fee payment. We are obligated to pay an annual license fee of $50.0 thousand. We are also obligated to make milestone payments up to $10.5 million on each Cambridge licensed product. In addition, we have agreed to pay a low single-digit royalty on products that incorporate the licensed patent rights, subject to offset in certain circumstances.  
 27


The Cambridge License continues in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration or revocation, without right of further appeal, of all licensed issued patents and filed patent applications, unless terminated earlier. We have the right to terminate for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice. Each party has the right to terminate immediately if the other party ceases to carry on its business. Either party may also terminate the Cambridge License for material breach if such breach remains uncured for 30 days. Cambridge may also terminate the Cambridge License if we fail to diligently develop and commercially exploit at least one Cambridge licensed product or we or our affiliates or sub-licensees commence any action against Cambridge to declare or render any claim of the licensed patent rights invalid, unpatentable, unenforceable, or not infringed.
 Competition 
 As a clinical-stage biotechnology company, we face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. These include both small companies and large companies with much greater financial and technical resources and far longer operating histories than our own. We also compete with the intellectual property, technology, and product development efforts of academic, governmental, and private research institutions. 
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may commercialize products more quickly than we are able to. 
 We are aware of the following treatment options in the areas that we are initially targeting: 
 Hearing loss 
 There are dozens of hearing aid brands, although approximately 80% of these devices are manufactured by four leading companies. There are three manufacturers of cochlear implants that market in the United States. We are also aware of multiple companies developing therapeutics to treat various forms of hearing loss. There are two companies with potential therapies to regenerate hair cells currently in clinical trials. Novartis conducted a Phase 1/2 trial with intracochlear delivery of an adenovirus-based gene therapy in subjects with severe to profound hearing loss, the data from which has not been shared to date, and Audion Therapeutics is conducting a Phase 2 study of its notch inhibitor, LY3056480, and Pipeline Therapeutics is conducting a Phase 1/2 study of its gamma secretase inhibitor. In 2020 Otonomy, Inc. disclosed top level data from a Phase 1/2 study of OTO-413, a sustained-exposure formulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in subjects with a condition described as speech-in-noise impairment. In addition, Sensorion, a clinical stage company is conducting a Phase 2 study to treat sudden SNHL. There are also multiple programs in early-stage or preclinical development by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In addition, there are several companies with programs to regrow neurons in the cochlea to treat hearing loss, and companies developing otoprotective therapies, which are intended to reduce damage to hair cells. 
 Multiple sclerosis 
 There are multiple therapeutic options for treating the symptoms of MS, as well as the underlying disease. However, all approved therapies are directed at blocking demyelination, and, to our knowledge, there are no approved therapies which promote remyelination. We are aware of numerous efforts to identify drugs or biologics that can stimulate oligodendrocyte regeneration and myelin repair in the central nervous system. These include Acorda Therapeutics which has conducted two Phase 1 trials of its monoclonal antibody rHIgM22 in MS patients. Convelo Therapeutics is developing potential remyelinating compounds that inhibit enzymes in the brain involved in the production of cholesterol for which they planned 
 28


to begin clinical trials in 2019, while Pipeline Therapeutics is developing a selective M1 receptor antagonist to treat multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating disorders. This is an active research area with a number of entities researching compounds, antibodies, and protein which may enhance remyelination. 
Government regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and export and import of our product candidates. 
 U.S. drug development process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and formulation studies, as well as animal safety studies, in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations, as appropriate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | endorsement by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the clinical site(s), and related services involved in the conduct of the clinical studies to assess compliance with good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or to conduct a post-approval study or studies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the submission including to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a partial or full clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical 
 29


holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or noncompliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unreasonable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate, and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. There are also requirements governing the registration of, reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. 
 Marketing approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. Specifically, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, 
 30


before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the submitted information supports that the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality, and purity. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that for certain medications with serious safety concerns the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver, or the indication sought is for an orphan condition. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. In some situations, the requirement for studies in pediatric populations can be waived if there is no relevant use.
 FDA-expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including orphan drug designation, rare pediatric disease designation, fast track designation, accelerated approval priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and the FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-
 31


threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, and is actively developing the drug for the disease. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of 10 months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six- and 10-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review, and, if relevant, accelerated approval. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The designation includes all the benefits of a fast track designation. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 32


The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state and local agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Marketing exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval based on the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA 
 33


from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity and extends patent life of a related patent if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. 
 Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, and transparency laws and regulations, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. State laws may require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, as well as require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and the reporting of pricing information and marketing expenditures. Violations of such laws, or any other governmental regulations that apply, may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting and oversight obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and individual imprisonment. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability of manufacturers to sell products profitably. 
 34


Healthcare reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the pharmaceutical industry. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical industry, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments, and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposes a nondeductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implements a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expands of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee; identify priorities in, and conducts comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and establishes a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in December 2018, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act modified the individual mandate. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the law.
 Legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference-pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 Foreign regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials in those countries, if relevant, and market application approval by foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, or EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of MAs: 
  
• | Community MAs—These are issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune, and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 35


 
not yet authorized in the EEA; for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation; or for products that are in the interest of public health in the EU.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs—These are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. The competent authority of the Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the Reference Member State, the product is subsequently granted a National MA in all the Member States, i.e., in the Reference Member State and the Member States Concerned.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy. 
 As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic product. For example, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the EEA, we expect they will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional noncumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period) we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EEA and prevents generics from relying on the marketing authorization holder’s pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical data for a period of eight years. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted, and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. However, a generic cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. In Japan, our products may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for such regulatory exclusivity, or that such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. 
 When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent Member State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial. In April 2014, the EU passed the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014), which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all EU member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive until the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. According to the current plans of the EMA, the Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to become applicable sometime in 2020. 
 Data privacy and security laws 
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, and the European Union General Data Protection 
 36


Regulation, or the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation.  Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
