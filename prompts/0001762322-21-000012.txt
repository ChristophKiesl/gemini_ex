ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a leading end-to-end auto ecommerce platform (based on volume) transforming the used car industry with a technology-driven, hassle-free customer experience. Our mission is to make car purchase and ownership simple — to make buying or selling a used car fun, fair, and accessible to everyone. We provide comprehensive, digital solutions throughout the car ownership lifecycle: finding the right car, having a test drive brought to you before buying the car, a seamless digitally-driven purchase transaction including financing and vehicle protection products, an efficient, digital trade-in/sale transaction, and a vision to provide high-value support services during car ownership. Each of these steps is powered by our software solutions, mobile transactions platform, and scalable logistics, combined with our six centralized inspection, reconditioning & storage centers, called Hubs.
We demystify the auto purchase experience in an industry known for high-pressure sales tactics that place the customer at a disadvantage. The traditional car buying experience is ripe for our brand of disruption: a recent survey by Gallup indicated that only 9% of consumers trust car salespeople and according to the DealerSocket Independent Dealership Action Report released in 2016, 81% are generally dissatisfied with the car buying process. The peer-to-peer market for automotive sales is even less transparent and is associated with many unknown factors that leave buyers and sellers uneasy. We use technology to eliminate guesswork and hassle and provides a more efficient, more reliable, more convenient and more trusted alternative.
Our vision is to provide a comprehensive experience for car owners, driven by technology at every step of the consumer lifecycle. Our continued investments in our research and discovery functionality create a platform that draws customers to engage with our website and provide a seamless search experience. Consumers may elect to purchase a vehicle online, through an at-home test drive, or during a test drive at one of our reconditioning and storage Hubs. During the purchasing process, our customers access a full suite of online financing options, vehicle service contracts, and other value add products to support the ownership experience. Over time, we will expand our machine learning-enabled recommendation engine to help customers find the cars best suited to them. Customer response to the Shift experience is extremely positive, resulting in a 70 Net Promoter Score (“NPS”), an order of magnitude higher score than traditional auto retailers. These positive experiences allow us to serve customers over the entire lifecycle of vehicle ownership and retain customers for repeat sales and purchases. We expect that by continuing to invest in services that benefit the customer throughout the ownership phase of the lifecycle (for example, vehicle maintenance plans), we will continue to establish a long-term customer base that will return for future transactions.
Launched in 2014, we currently operate six West Coast Hubs capable of reaching over 85% of the California population and a large portion of the populations of Oregon and Washington. Our established Hubs have been successful in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Orange County, San Diego, Sacramento, and Portland, and we have recently expanded to Seattle in October 2020. We launched select inventory acquisitions in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas in November 2020, and plan to expand to additional metropolitan areas. Each region is supported by one Hub location that acts as the central point for reconditioning and vehicle storage that also accommodates customers who prefer to browse inventory onsite. By targeting urban, densely populated markets, we have used direct-to-consumer digital marketing and a responsive ecommerce sales approach to grow our market penetration. With current operations out of six West Coast Hubs, which together account for only 14%2 of the U.S. population, we have significant runway for continued expansion.
Our differentiated strategy offers a wide variety of vehicles across the entire spectrum of model, price, age, and mileage to ensure that we have the right car for buyers regardless of interest, need, budget, or credit. We are the only online dealer to offer a fully omni-channel fulfillment model, led by our patented system for managing on-demand test drives brought to customers at their preferred location, such as their home. There are three ways to purchase a car from us:
•On-demand test drive: We conveniently bring any car to the customer’s desired location within our service area for a no-obligation, contactless test drive, usually at their home or work. If the customer chooses to purchase the vehicle, a Shift concierge staff can process the transaction on-the-spot via a mobile app.
•Buy online: Customers can buy a car sight-unseen without a test drive and have it delivered to their home quickly with the same seven-day return policy as is offered on cars bought in person.
•Hub test drive: Customers may come to one of our hub locations to see and test drive multiple cars. When they arrive, customers can scan a QR code on each car to immediately view all relevant details, including ownership & service history, inspection reports, vehicle history reports, and most importantly, dynamic pricing and market price comparisons. This immediate access to all relevant information — without having to rely on a salesman — puts customers in control.
___________________________________________
Incorporated December 9, 2013 in the state of Delaware
Includes metropolitan statistical area (MSA’s) within 60 miles of Shift reconditioning facilities in San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle.
As of December 31, 2020, the Seattle Hub was active for vehicle storage and sales but had not yet commenced vehicle reconditioning operations.
Regardless of the approach chosen by the customer, they will be supported by friendly Shift Concierge and Advisor team members. For all buyers, we offer a full suite of options to consumers to finance and protect their vehicle through the only mobile point-of-sale solution on the market. Through our platform, we connect customers to various lending partners for a completely digital end-to-end process for financing and service products. A customer can also complete a short online prequalification form and immediately see a filtered view of cars that meet their budget based on the financing options for which they are likely to be able to qualify. Customers can also get approved for financing before they even test drive a car, making it much more likely that the customer will purchase a car from us.
We focus on unit economics driven by direct vehicle acquisition channels, optimized inventory mix and ancillary product offerings, combined with streamlined inventory onboarding, low fulfillment costs, and centralized software. In 2020, we sourced 88% of our inventory from consumer-sellers and partners driving industry-leading margins and customer acquisition cost. Our data-driven vehicle evaluations help ensure acquisition of the right inventory at the right price to reduce days to sale. We believe that a differentiated ability to purchase vehicles directly from consumer-sellers as compared to our competitors, who purchase a higher percentage through the wholesale market, provides us access to a deeper pool of scarce, highly desirable inventory.
Sellers are able to go to shift.com, submit information on their car, and get a quote instantly. We use a proprietary algorithm for pricing that utilizes current information about market conditions, demand and supply, and car option data, among other factors. Using proprietary pricing and Shift-built mobile diagnostic tools, we provide an immediate quote for a customer’s trade-in vehicle, and will schedule an on-demand evaluation at the customer’s location by a member of the Shift concierge staff. We provide selling customers with information on market rates and, when a customer is ready to sell their car, we can digitally initiate e-contracting and an ACH transfer and conveniently take the car on the seller’s behalf so the seller doesn’t even have to leave his or her home to sell their car.
All of the cars we sell undergo a rigorous 150+ point mechanical inspection and reconditioning process at one of our six regional reconditioning Hub facilities to help ensure that they’re safe, reliable, up to cosmetic standards, and comfortable. Reconditioning standards are segmented into branded quality tiers of: Shift Certified for newer, lower-mileage vehicles and Shift Value for lower-cost, older or higher mileage vehicles to optimize the level of aesthetic finish for what customers care about most.
The Company currently is organized into two reportable segments: Retail and Wholesale. The Retail segment represents retail sales of used vehicles through the Company’s ecommerce platform and fees earned on sales of value-added products associated with those vehicles sales such as vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection waiver coverage, prepaid maintenance plans, and appearance protection plans. The Wholesale segment represents sales of used vehicles through wholesale auctions or directly to a wholesaler (“DTW”).
Technology Platform
We provide a superior consumer experience that breaks with traditional auto retail and is powered by technology throughout. By using technology, we can enable a Shift Concierge with limited exposure to the used auto market to perform as well as or better than used auto professionals with decades of experience at traditional retailers while creating a better customer experience. Machine learning helps to optimize customer conversion by helping the customer find the right vehicle at the right price with the right financing and service options. With only basic information, we work to predict which cars will be most appealing and what financing options will be available for a customer. If a customer pre-qualifies for financing, conversion rates dramatically improve.
Approximately 97% of consumer auto purchases involve online research. These consumers have historically been forced to go offline to purchase a car because there are so few options for completing a car purchase online. Our technology allows a consumer to complete the car buying process that they begin by shopping online without having to set foot in a dealership. Our technology platform enables a fully mobile digital transaction experience:
•from at-home car searching
•to scheduling an on-demand test drive with the push of a button;
•to purchasing at home or at the preferred site of a test drive; and
•with the financing and services products expected from an industry-leading experience.
This provides a convenient, no-haggle, and streamlined transaction that customers enjoy and trust.
Likewise, the Shift technology platform for selling a car provides a seamless consumer experience. Customers go online, enter in information about their car, and get an instant online quote. The machine learning-driven acquisition engine predicts the price we will pay for the vehicle, the price at which we can resell the vehicle, the level of reconditioning required to determine impact on margin and operations, and the likelihood that consumers will purchase ancillary products in connection with the sale of the vehicle. Upon completion, a member of the Shift concierge staff comes to the customer’s house, conducts a transaction in person, including an electronic transfer of the funds paid to the seller of the car, and then takes away the vehicle.
Our operations are fully powered by technology throughout all stages of the selling and buying processes. A proprietary app empowers Shift concierges to conduct evaluations, accept payment, and execute transactions onsite and in real time electronically. The Shift app empowers mechanics by displaying a step-by-step guide for inspection and reconditioning, while tracking this data in a cloud database for real-time analytics and decision engine processing to provide optimized reconditioning standards.
Our technology suite is critical to our scalability as it allows us to accelerate employee development and decreases required training time, while providing a communication channel to interact with the customer and also providing a responsive and enjoyable customer experience. It is also the first mobile point of sale for the used car marketplace and it allows a customer to complete real-time applications for loan and service contracts, and as a result, receive the instant results needed to complete e-contracting and transfer payment.
Industry and Market Opportunity
The U.S. used automotive market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for disruption as consumers remain dissatisfied with the traditional purchase experience and overall consumer preferences increasingly are shifting to online transactions.
•Massive market: According to the Edmunds Used Vehicle Report 2019, in 2019, the U.S. used automotive market generated $841 billion in sales from over 40 million vehicle purchases.
•Highly fragmented: Market share in the U.S. is extremely fragmented with the largest 100 dealer groups representing only 6% of used auto unit sales according to Automotive News. According to the Manheim 2018 Used Car Market Report & Outlook, the peer-to-peer market represents 50% of used auto sales.
U.S. Used Vehicle Unit Sales
•Ripe for disruption: The used car buying process suffers from poor overall consumer experience — highlighted by low NPS4 scores throughout the used auto retail industry — which is attributable to opaque pricing, high pressure sales tactics, inventory of questionable and widely varying quality, and a generally arduous and lengthy sales process. Additionally, brick-and-mortar retailers are plagued by elevated overhead costs and capital expenditures that must be passed on to the customer. The peer-to-peer market has even greater challenges for consumers including lack of transparency including the possibility of fraud, logistical challenges, limited or no ability to test drive or return vehicles, lack of financing or warranty options, and perception of dishonesty and aggressive tactics in the sales process.

•Limited ecommerce penetration: The used automotive market remains among the least penetrated ecommerce markets in the U.S. with the three largest players (us, Carvana, and Vroom) capturing less than 1% of all sales in 2019 according to the 2019 Automotive Ecommerce Report from Digital Commerce 360. There is significant opportunity for increased penetration as that report noted 49% of consumers reported a willingness to purchase a vehicle online.
U.S. ecommerce Penetration % by Industry
•COVID-19 pandemic: Although the ultimate impacts of COVID-19 remain uncertain and consumer demand for autos may be impacted in a recessionary environment, a recent survey published by Capgemini found that 46% of U.S. adults surveyed plan to use their cars more often and public transportation less often in the future. Additionally, the pandemic is accelerating trends of online shopping more broadly as consumers seek to avoid physical retail locations.
We are focused on the largest segment of the used car market, which comprises inventory between 3 and 10 years of age — a category that makes up approximately 84% of all used vehicle transactions based on a 2019 NIADA report. Our average sale price is approximately $16,000, which is representative of the fact that a large number of our vehicle sales occur at a price point of under $20,000, reflecting our focus on the largest portion of the used auto market. For 2019 and 2020, 83% and 83%, respectively, of our vehicle sales were for a list price of less than $20,000. By comparison, automotive sales of less than $20,000 comprise 57% of all sales for franchise dealers and 99% of all sales for independent dealers. We believe this makes us well positioned to take market share from legacy auto retailers as its inventory is most heavily concentrated in the deepest pool of demand in the used auto market. In mid-2019, to address a perceived need in the lower price point market, we classified our inventory into two categories, Shift Value and Shift Certified. Shift Value inventory is made up of cars that are over 8 years old or have more than 80,000 miles. Shift Certified inventory consists of vehicles less than 8 years old with less than 80,000 miles. While all vehicles are subjected to the same 150+ point inspection and our high mechanical and safety standards, this segmentation allows us to focus sales and marketing strategies, as well as optimize cosmetic reconditioning costs, for cars with a lower overall purchase price. Consumers seeking Shift Value vehicles are generally less concerned with cosmetic deficiencies; therefore, we have focused our reconditioning on these vehicles to safety and longevity issues, passing on savings to customers while also increasing profitability. This strategy allows us to effectively sell selected older and higher-mileage inventory.

Providing test drives is critical to optimizing customer conversion for Shift Value cars which customers typically prefer to test drive as compared to newer vehicles where it is less critical. In-house reconditioning provides better control of timing and greater efficiency, especially amongst Shift Value vehicles, and provides the ability to customize standards by distinct categories. Test drive-led omni-channel sales allow customers to experience the individual used car prior to purchase, which can be particularly important to customers for older used vehicles. Customer service is led by Shift Concierges that focus on providing an enjoyable experience as well as a centralized, inside Shift Advisor team powered by data to identify customer propensity to purchase and tailor the customer experience. Combined with unique customer-sourced inventory acquired through proprietary software, this creates a compelling business model that is designed to scale efficiently and difficult to replicate.
As the U.S. used automotive market follows other industries in moving consumer transactions online and away from traditional brick-and-mortar retail, mobile ecommerce represents an even higher growth opportunity than broader ecommerce. Consumer preferences increasingly demand the convenience of on-demand and at-home personalized experiences. These tailwinds present a compelling opportunity as we provide a test drive-led omni-channel platform and an end-to-end mobile-first ecommerce experience that leverages data to predict preferences and suggest our deeper inventory of scarce consumer sourced vehicles, with such tailored service to consumers facilitated by our knowledgeable team of concierges.
We have a highly efficient capital-light business model that provides service to a much broader geographic area as compared to traditional retailers. We have a repeatable playbook for expansion to new urban markets. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our new market entry process, led by our technology suite, which replicates across markets and brings on staff rapidly through the simplicity and effectiveness of our software tools.
We continue to drive penetration in existing markets and have captured over 4% of all used car sales in top zip codes of the San Francisco Area. Expanding share in existing markets represents a massive opportunity for growth in itself and, coupled with new market expansion, poises us for significant revenue expansion.
We source the most desirable cars by acquiring unique and scarce inventory directly from consumers and from third-party partners.
•Consumers: We source the majority of our cars directly from consumers utilizing proprietary software, which predicts real-time market-based demand and establishes a profitable market clearing price for vehicles.
•Third-Party: Acquiring cars from consumer facing partners and fleet operators provides additional scarce inventory to efficiently supplement growth while maintaining high-quality inventory.
Competition
The used vehicle market in the United States is highly fragmented, with over 42,000 dealers nationwide as well as a large number of transactions occurring in the peer-to-peer market. Competitors in the used vehicle market include:
•traditional new and used car dealerships;
•the peer-to-peer market, utilizing sites such as Facebook, Craigslist, OfferUp, eBay Motors and Nextdoor;
•used car ecommerce businesses or online platforms, mainly Carvana and Vroom; and
•sales by rental car companies directly to consumers of used vehicles which were previously utilized in rental fleets, such as Hertz Car Sales and Enterprise Car Sales.
Our primary competitors, traditional brick-and-mortar used auto dealers, are operating under an outdated business model, which relies on a lack of transparency, high pressure sales tactics, limited inventory, and scarce physical locations to which the customer must travel. These drawbacks in the traditional retail model have allowed ecommerce competitors to rapidly gain share of the used car dealer market in recent years. Additionally, we are well-positioned to gain share from the peer-to-peer market given our focus on acquiring inventory from consumers rather than auctions.

Our Competitive Strengths
•Purpose-built ecommerce platform: The Shift platform was built to be an end-to-end online auto solution for consumers who yearn for a differentiated, simple and efficient transaction. The streamlined nature of our business allows for scalability and efficiency in costs compared to our competitors in the auto retail industry, and technology creates a better overall experience for the consumer.
•Industry-leading technology: Our technology enhances the auto shopping experience while making the process fun and easy compared to the poorly rated experience of dealing with a brick-and-mortar dealer. Most customers begin their car search online and spend most of their car-shopping experience online. Therefore, we believe the best way to enhance the overall process is to provide a digitally driven omni-channel approach to not only begin, but seamlessly complete, the car-buying experience online.
•Unique customer-driven offerings: We are the only ecommerce used car platform that gives customers the option to test drive a vehicle before completing their purchase. By offering customers this ability either on-demand through the proprietary Shift app or via contactless test drive at one of our Hubs, we are able to cover more ground with fewer locations as compared to traditional competitors and offer a service that our ecommerce peers do not provide. Our test-drive strategy decreases our cost to penetrate a new market, while offering customers the benefit of driving before they buy.
•Broad Inventory Selection Including the Shift Value Segment and Test Drives: Our unique ecommerce-driven test-drive strategy allows us to offer inventory that includes a wide spectrum of ages and price, rather than focusing exclusively on newer and more expensive cars. Our vehicle acquisition technology also results in broader, more desirable inventory than would result from the traditional focus on the auction and OEM sourcing. We focus on vehicle models over four years old, with an average price point of approximately $16,000. We also have a differentiated “Shift Value” segment of vehicles which are over eight years old or have more than 80,000 miles. This category of inventory is highly desirable to a large market segment, and counter-cyclical, with demand increasing in poor economic conditions. Our inventory is thus diverse enough and better positioned to weather a down economy and shifting consumer preferences. We believe to be successful in the value segment, it is critical to own the reconditioning process and offer consumers a test drive option during the purchase process.
Our Strategy
•Increase Market Penetration by Creating a Customer-Centered Purchase Experience: Shift was born from a dissatisfaction with the traditional used car-buying experience, which can feel time-consuming, stressful, and dishonest. Our goal is to turn what is generally regarded as a burdensome necessity into a delightful experience. We achieve this by offering customers no-haggle pricing, and a “partner not push” buying experience. Customers may arrange for test drives managed by a Shift Concierge, not a traditional used car salesman; unlike many traditional used car dealers, we don’t employ pushy salespeople. In addition to performing a 150+ point inspection on all of our vehicles, we offer customers a seven-day, 200 mile return policy. As a result, our Net Promoter Score (a measure of customer satisfaction) of 70 is consistently higher than traditional auto retailers.
•Geographic Expansion: We operate six centralized inspection and reconditioning centers that service broad areas in our geographic footprint. Our technology and logistics network allow it to cover a broader area than traditional dealers, with an average radius of service from each Shift hub location of 60 miles for on-demand at home test drives, and an even wider radius for online purchases. We intend to continue to capitalize on the lower capital costs that this network makes available to expand to additional geographic areas, primarily targeting urban, densely populated markets
•Deliver Ownership Support Throughout the Entire Lifecycle and Capitalize on Ancillary Product Offering: We are building the capability to support the entire lifecycle of vehicle ownership, including service, maintenance and repair. We seek to become the single company consumers think of every time they want to do anything with a car — buy, sell, service or protect — to make car ownership simple.
•Leverage Scalable Proprietary Marketplace and Logistics Platform: Not only do we use our technology to buy, sell, and maintain the cars we sell through our own Hubs, but we have also built modular, scalable proprietary technology solutions for a logistics management and mobile transactions platform that can be leveraged by other car sellers including other dealers. Our vision is to evolve into a true platform marketplace that lists and fulfills third-party inventory, enabling traditional dealers to modernize through its platform and those who might otherwise build a traditional dealership channel to make use of the Shift platform instead. We envision enabling other dealers to do this through Shift ‘Virtual Hubs’ so customers can get the biggest selection and best experience, all under the Shift brand with the same trust and peace of mind. By becoming the online destination for consumers who want to buy or sell a car, we also plan to become the platform for dealers who want to transact with those consumers. 
•Accelerate Growth Through Strategic M&A of Third-Party Inventory Sources & Development of Our Omni-Channel Platform: The market for used cars is highly fragmented. We intend to consider acquisitions that further our strategy of developing an omni-channel distribution platform, combining digital delivery and strategic retail presence.
Marketing
We believe our customer base is representative of the overall market for used cars as our vehicles cover the full spectrum of used car price points. Our sales and marketing efforts utilize a multi-channel approach, built on a seasonality-adjusted, market-based model budget. We direct marketing to both buyers and sellers, which is part of why we are able to acquire a majority of our inventory directly from customers. We believe our strong customer focus ensures customer loyalty which will drive both repeat purchases and referrals. In addition to our paid channels, we intend to attract new customers through enhancing our earned media and public relations efforts as well as via increased brand marketing spend.
•Buyer Marketing: We drive buyer traffic to the Shift platform with search engine optimization and paid digital advertising such as Google, Facebook, and third-party affiliate channels.
•Seller Marketing: Advertising to sellers through similar channels as buyers is part of what allows us to acquire a significant portion of inventory directly from customers, which we believe is a competitive advantage.
•Brand Marketing: Historically, we have not invested in brand marketing for the platform as we have focused on refining the product and optimizing unit economics. We believe spending on brand marketing beginning in the second half of 2020 will allow us to accelerate growth as consumers become increasingly aware of the Shift experience.
Service Providers
We utilize several third-party partners to finance purchases of our vehicles by customers who desire or need such financing. We also offer value-added products to our customers through third-party partners, including vehicle service contracts, GAP waiver protection and wheel and tire coverage. None of these third-party partners are individually significant to our operations.
Employees
As of March 16, 2021 we had approximately 824 employees. All of our employees are W-2 employees and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
Seasonality
We expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profitability, if any, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on, among other things, consumers’ car buying patterns. We have typically experienced higher revenue growth rates in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in each of the first or fourth quarters of the calendar year (2019 was an exception to these quarterly trends, as our inventory position was highest entering 2019, which resulted in higher volume for the first quarter 2019). We believe these results are due to seasonal buying patterns driven in part by the timing of income tax refunds, which we believe are an important source of car buyers’ down payments on used vehicle purchases. We believe that an effective brand marketing campaign will allow us to maintain sales growth through seasonality, however we recognize that in the future our revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, specifically the automotive retail industry.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and other intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We seek to protect our intellectual property through patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as confidentiality agreements, other contractual commitments and security procedures. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our technology and other proprietary information.
We own one issued U.S. patent and have one pending U.S. patent application. We also have an application pending to register Shift™ as a trademark in the United States. We regularly review our technology development efforts and branding strategy to identify and assess the protection of new intellectual property.
Intellectual property laws, contractual commitments and security procedures provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, intellectual property laws vary from country to country, and we have not sought patents or trademark registrations outside of the United States. Therefore, in other jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect certain of our proprietary technology, brands, or other intellectual property.
Government Regulation
Our business is and will continue to be subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The advertising, sale, purchase, financing and transportation of used vehicles are regulated by every state in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. We also are subject to state laws related to titling and registration and wholesale vehicle sales, and our sale of value-added products is subject to state licensing requirements, as well as federal and state consumer protection laws. These laws can vary significantly from state to state. In addition, we are subject to regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce and the collection, storage and use of personal information and other customer data. We are also subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunities Act and prohibitions against unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The federal governmental agencies that regulate our business and have the authority to enforce such regulations and laws against us include the FTC, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. For example, the FTC has jurisdiction to investigate and enforce our compliance with certain consumer protection laws and has brought enforcement actions against auto dealers relating to a broad range of practices, including the sale and financing of value-added or add-on products. Additionally, we are subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities, state consumer protection agencies and state financial regulatory agencies. We also are subject to audit by such state regulatory authorities.
State dealer licensing authorities regulate the purchase and sale of used vehicles by dealers within their respective states. The applicability of these regulatory and legal compliance obligations to our ecommerce business is dependent on evolving interpretations of these laws and regulations and how our operations are, or are not, subject to them. We are licensed as a dealer in California, Oregon and Washington and all of our vehicle transactions are conducted under our California, Oregon and Washington licenses. We believe that our activities in other states are not currently subject to their vehicle dealer licensing laws, however if we determine that obtaining a license in another state is necessary, either due to expansion or otherwise, we may not be able to obtain such a license within the timeframe we expect or at all.
Some states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that retail installment sellers file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. All of our installment sale transactions are currently conducted under our California, Oregon or Washington dealer licenses. However, as we seek to expand to other states, we may be required to obtain additional licenses and our ability to do so cannot be assured.
In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to the sale and financing of used vehicles, our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, and other broadly applicable business regulations. We also are subject to laws and regulations involving taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, pricing, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, mobile communications, consumer protection, information-reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our platform, the design and operation of websites and internet neutrality. In connection with the closing of the merger, we are also now subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and exchange listing rules.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies to cover directors’ and officers’ liability, fiduciary, crime, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability and umbrella insurance.
All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We and our global insurance broker regularly review our insurance policies and believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business.
