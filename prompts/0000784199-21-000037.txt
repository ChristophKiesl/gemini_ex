Strategy

CryoLife is committed to partnering with surgeons and cardiologists to deliver innovative technologies that restore the health of patients with aortic disease. Our strategic plan is focused on four growth areas that we expect to drive our business in the future. We plan to drive growth: 

New Products – Through product development and commercialization of new and next-generation products and services focused on aortic repair;
New Indications – Through new regulatory approvals and expanded indications for our existing products and services in new markets;
Global Expansion – By entering new international markets, establishing new international direct sales territories, and developing our commercial infrastructure in new markets, including emerging markets, China and Brazil; and
Business Development – By pursuing select acquisitions, licensing, and distribution opportunities that are aligned to our objectives and complement our existing products, services, and infrastructure. Examples include our acquisitions of JOTEC, On-X, and Ascyrus and our distribution agreement and purchase option for NEXUS. To the extent that we identify, develop or acquire non-core products or applications, we may dispose of these assets or pursue licensing or distribution agreements with third party partners for development or commercialization.

To the extent that we may own or develop non-core products or applications, we may dispose of those assets or pursue development, licensing, or other commercialization agreements with third-party partners. 




Markets, Products, Services, and Competition

Our medical devices and preservation services are primarily used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to treat patients with aortic disease, including heart valve disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, and, to a lesser extent, other conditions in cardiac and vascular surgery. 

We face competition from several domestic and international medical device, pharmaceutical, and biopharmaceutical companies and from both for-profit and non-profit tissue processors. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and personnel resources than we have. Some of these competitors might have greater experience in developing products, procuring tissues, conducting clinical trials, and obtaining regulatory approvals, and they might have large contracts with hospitals under which they can obtain purchase requirements that place our products at a disadvantage. Some of these competitors might obtain patent protection or approval or clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or foreign regulators sooner than we do. Some might have superior manufacturing efficiency, tissue processing capacity, and/or marketing capabilities. We cannot assure that our current or future competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies, products, or services that have advantages over those that have been, or are being, developed by us or that would render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. Any of these competitive disadvantages could materially, adversely affect us. 

We discuss the cardiac and vascular surgery markets in which we compete and our products, services, and technologies with which we compete in each of these markets below.

Cardiac Surgery Markets

Surgical Sealants

Closing internal wounds effectively following surgical procedures is critical to the restoration of the function of tissue and to the ultimate success of the surgical procedure. Failure to seal surgical wounds effectively can result in leakage of blood in cardiac surgeries, air in lung surgeries, cerebrospinal fluid in neurosurgeries, and gastrointestinal contents in abdominal surgeries. Fluid, air, and gastric leakage resulting from surgical procedures can lead to prolonged hospitalization, greater post-operative pain, higher costs, and higher mortality rates.

Sutures and staples facilitate healing by joining wound edges to allow the body to heal naturally. Sutures and staples, however, cannot consistently eliminate air and fluid leakage at the wound site, particularly when used to close tissues containing air or fluids under pressure, such as in blood vessels, the lobes of the lung, the dural membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and the gastrointestinal tract. In some cases, the tissues may be friable, which complicates surgical wound closure. In addition, it can be difficult and time consuming for the physician to apply sutures and staples in minimally invasive surgical procedures where the physician must operate through small access openings. We believe that the use of surgical adhesives and sealants, with or without sutures and staples, in certain areas can enhance the efficacy of these procedures through more effective and rapid wound closure. 

BioGlue

Our proprietary BioGlue product is a polymer consisting of bovine blood protein and an agent for cross-linking proteins, which was developed for use in cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and general surgical applications. BioGlue is stronger than other cardiovascular sealants with a tensile strength that is four to five times that of fibrin sealants. BioGlue begins to polymerize within 20 to 30 seconds and reaches its bonding strength within two minutes and it adheres to tissues in a wet field. BioGlue is dispensed through a controlled delivery system that consists of a disposable syringe and various applicator tips. BioGlue syringes are available in pre-filled 2ml, 5ml, and 10ml volumes with applicator tips suitable for various applications. 




BioGlue is FDA approved as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels. We distribute BioGlue under Conformité Européene Mark product certification (“CE Mark”) for repair of soft tissues (which include cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, and additional soft tissues). We also distribute BioGlue in Japan where it is approved for adhesion and support of hemostasis for aortotomy closure sites, suture/anastomosis sites (including aortic dissection and anastomosis sites with use of a prosthetic graft), and suture sites on the heart. Additional marketing approvals have been granted for specified applications in several other countries throughout the world. 

BioGlue competes primarily with surgical sealants from Baxter International Inc, (“Baxter”); Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson Company (“Ethicon”); Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation; and C.R. Bard Inc. (“Bard”), a subsidiary of Becton, Dickinson, and Company (“BD”). BioGlue competes with these products based on its features and benefits, such as its strength and ease of use.

We sell BioGlue throughout the world including North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (collectively, “EMEA”), Asia Pacific (“APAC”), and Latin America (“LATAM”). Revenues from BioGlue accounted for 25% of total revenues in each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

Heart Valves and Cardiac Patches for Cardiac Reconstruction

Patients with heart disease can experience valve insufficiency, regurgitation, or stenosis that may require heart valve repair or replacement surgery.  Patients with congenital cardiac defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot, Truncus Arteriosus, and Pulmonary Atresia can require complex cardiac reconstructive surgery to repair the defect. A variety of tissues and synthetic materials are implanted in these cardiac procedures. Implantable human tissues (homografts) and animal tissues (xenografts) as well as other synthetic materials may be used in cardiac procedures. Implantable devices may be entirely synthetic, such as mechanical heart valves, or contain both synthetic materials and xenograft tissue components, such as bioprosthetic heart valves.

Mechanical heart valves are durable and often last for the remainder of a patient’s life without replacement, even for relatively young patients with long life expectancies. Mechanical valves are readily available and are a less expensive solution for those requiring a heart valve replacement. These valves contain a synthetic sewing ring to facilitate surgical implantation of the device. Patients who receive mechanical heart valves are required to undergo long-term blood thinning or anticoagulation drug therapy to minimize the risk of stroke or other complications from the formation of blood clots.

Bioprosthetic valves are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a valve replacement. Bioprosthetic tissues contain bovine, equine, or porcine tissues that are typically processed with glutaraldehyde, which may result in progressive calcification, or hardening of the tissue over time. Bioprosthetic heart valves usually have a life of 7 to 20 years, after which the valve typically must be replaced. Multiple replacements, each requiring open heart surgery, can be a significant concern for patients, particularly younger patients. These valves typically contain a synthetic sewing ring to facilitate surgical implantation. Patients receiving a bioprosthetic heart valve may not require long-term anticoagulation drug therapy, although some of these patients may require anticoagulation drug therapy for other heart or vascular conditions that are common in this patient population.

The sewing rings of both mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves are synthetic materials that may harbor bacteria and lead to infection (endocarditis), which can be difficult to treat with antibiotics. Patients with an infected mechanical or bioprosthetic valve may require valve replacement surgery. The 2013 Society of Thoracic Surgeons Guidelines, (the “Guidelines”) as published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery, have increased the indication (from Class II to Class I) and broadened the scope for using a human heart valve during aortic valve replacement surgery due to endocarditis. The Class I indication means that an aortic homograft is the recommended course of treatment when endocarditis has functionally destroyed the aortic valve annulus. The previous Class II indication meant that it was an acceptable course of treatment. Consequently, for many physicians, human heart valves are the preferred alternative to animal-derived and mechanical valves for patients who have, or are at risk to contract, endocarditis.





Human heart valves are available for use in valve replacement procedures. Human heart valves allow for more normal blood flow, often provide higher cardiac output than mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves, and do not require long-term anticoagulation drug therapy. Human tissue responds better to treatment for infections and, consequently, for many physicians, human heart valves are the preferred alternative to animal-derived and mechanical valves for patients who have or are at risk to contract endocarditis. Human tissue valves are also not as susceptible to progressive calcification as glutaraldehyde-fixed bioprosthetic tissues. A Ross Procedure may be a preferred surgical technique by physicians and patients, particularly for young patients, due to the human valve’s long-term resistance to calcification and the patient’s relative freedom from re-intervention surgery. In a Ross Procedures, a diseased aortic valve is replaced with a patient’s own pulmonary valve, which is in turn replaced with a donated human pulmonary valve. 

Human tissue patches are also available for use in a variety of cardiac repair procedures. Human vascular tissues are used in cardiac and vascular bypass surgery. The transplant of any human tissue that has not been preserved, however, must be accomplished within extremely short time limits. Cryopreservation, or cooling and storing at extremely cold temperatures, expands the treatment options available by extending these timelines.

We currently market the On-X aortic and mitral mechanical heart valves for valve replacement procedures. We also market our cardiac preservation services, including our CryoValve and CryoValve SG human tissues, for heart valve replacement surgeries and our CryoPatch and CryoPatch SG human tissues for cardiac repair procedures. Our PhotoFix product is a bovine patch device used for cardiac and vascular repair.

On-X Mechanical Heart Valves

The On-X product line includes the On-X prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valve and the On-X ascending aortic prosthesis (“AAP”). We also distribute CarbonAid® CO2 diffusion catheters and sell Chord-X® ePTFE sutures for mitral chordal replacement, and we offer pyrolytic carbon coating services to other medical device manufacturers as part of the On-X family of products. 

On-X heart valves are bileaflet mechanical valves composed of a graphite substrate coated with On-X’s silicon-free pyrolytic carbon coating that provides a smooth microstructure surface. We believe that the smooth pyrolytic carbon surface and other characteristics of the valve, such as full, 90-degree leaflet opening of the valve and flared valve inlet, contribute to the flow dynamics of the On-X valve. The On-X AAP is an On-X aortic valve combined with a synthetic vascular graft to allow physicians to more conveniently treat patients requiring both an aortic valve replacement and replacement of a portion of the ascending aorta with an aortic graft. Each device is available in a range of valve sizes in a variety of sewing ring options to suit physicians’ preferences, along with dedicated instruments to facilitate valve sizing and implantation. On-X heart valves are FDA approved for the replacement of diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic heart valves in the aortic and mitral positions and are classified as a Class III medical device. We also hold a CE Mark for On-X heart valves. 

As discussed above, all mechanical valve patients require long-term anticoagulation drug therapy with a drug called warfarin to reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. Because warfarin can also cause a risk of harmful bleeding, dosage must be monitored and may require adjustment over time. Certain dietary restrictions may also be imposed on warfarin patients. 

PROACT was a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing a reduced versus standard warfarin dose for On-X heart valve recipients. In the aortic valve replacement arm of PROACT, the reduced warfarin dose group had 60% fewer bleeding events without an increased risk of stroke. As a consequence, in 2015, the FDA approved the On-X aortic valve for use with a lower INR (International Normalized Ratio), which means that patients with On-X heart valves can be managed on lower doses of warfarin for anticoagulation. This new indication was, and still is, unique to the On-X aortic valve. The 2020 American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology guidelines specifically mentioned On-X aortic heart valves as the only mechanical aortic heart valve that can be managed at a low INR of 1.5 -2.0. While use of a lower INR has been approved for the On-X aortic heart valve, such use for the On-X mitral heart valve is still under clinical investigation. Enrollment in the On-X mitral valve replacement arm is now complete, and we currently intend to submit the results of this trial for FDA approval in mid 2021. 




While patients with an On-X aortic heart valve can be safely maintained at a lower INR, patients with mechanical prosthetic valves would still benefit by elimination of the need for warfarin anticoagulation therapy, due to warfarin’s significant drawbacks for patients including the need to frequently draw blood for monitoring and to observe certain dietary and alcohol restrictions. We believe that providing an acceptable alternative to warfarin anticoagulation may increase the number of patients choosing an On-X aortic heart valve not only due to the valve’s existing durability and clinical superiority, but also due to the ability to avoid warfarin.

As a result, CryoLife initiated the PROACT Xa clinical trial to determine if patients with an On-X mechanical aortic valve can be maintained safely and effectively on apixaban (Eliquis®) as an alternative to warfarin, given the drawbacks associated with warfarin.  This prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial is on-going and the first patient was enrolled in May 2020; enrollment will continue through 2021.

On-X heart valves compete primarily with mechanical valves from Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Inc. (“Medtronic”); and LivaNova PLC (“LivaNova”) (which business LivaNova recently sold to Gyrus Capital SA). On-X heart valves compete with these products based on their features and benefits, such as full, 90-degree leaflet opening, pure pyrolytic carbon, flared inlet, and approved labeling claim for reduced INR for aortic valves. 

We began selling On-X heart valves in January 2016 following the acquisition of On-X. We sell On-X heart valves throughout the world including North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Revenues from On-X products accounted for 19%, 18%, and 17% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

Cardiac Preservation Services

Our proprietary preservation process involves our dissection, processing, preservation, and storage of donated human tissues until they are shipped to a hospital where they are implanted by physicians. The cardiac tissues we currently preserve include aortic and pulmonary heart valves and cardiac patches in three primary pulmonary anatomic configurations: hemi-artery, trunk, and branch. These tissues more closely resemble in structure, and simulate the performance of, the patient’s own tissue compared to non-human tissue alternatives. Our cardiac tissues are used in a variety of valve replacement and cardiac reconstruction surgeries. We believe the human tissues we distribute offer specific clinical advantages over mechanical, synthetic, and bioprosthetic alternatives. Depending on the alternative, the clinical advantages of our heart valves include more natural blood flow properties, better results in patients who have endocarditis, no requirement for long-term drug therapy to prevent excessive blood clotting, and a reduced risk of catastrophic failure, thromboembolism (stroke), or deterioration due to calcification. 

Our cardiac tissues include the CryoValve® SG pulmonary heart valve (“CryoValve SGPV”) and the CryoPatch® SG pulmonary cardiac patch (“CryoPatch SG”) which are both processed with our proprietary SynerGraft® decellularization technology. A multi-center study showed that, at 10 years, patients implanted with our proprietary SynerGraft SGPV valves had a 17% re-operation rate, as compared to a 40% re-operation rate for patients implanted with non-SynerGraft valves. 

We believe that the human heart valves preserved by us compare favorably with bioprosthetic and mechanical valves for certain indications and patient populations, and that the human cardiac patches preserved by us compare favorably with xenograft small intestine submucosa (“SIS”) and glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardial patches due to the benefits of human tissue discussed above. Human tissue is preferred by many physicians as the replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions, such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction, congenital cardiac defect repair, valve replacements for women in their child-bearing years, and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis. In addition, implantation of SynerGraft treated cardiac tissue reduces the risk for induction of Class I and Class II alloantibodies, based on Panel Reactive Antibody (“PRA”) measured at up to one year, compared to standard processed cardiac tissues. We believe that this reduced risk may provide a competitive advantage for CryoValve SGPV and CryoPatch SG for patients who later need a whole organ transplant, because an increased PRA can decrease the number of possible donors for subsequent organ transplants and increase time on transplant waiting lists. 




Two other domestic tissue processors, LifeNet Health, Inc. (“LifeNet”) and LeMaitre Vascular (“LeMaitre”), offer preserved human heart valves and patches in competition with us. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of surgeon preference, documented clinical data, technology, and customer service, particularly with respect to the capabilities of our field representatives. Alternatives to human heart valves processed by us include valve repair and valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves or mechanical valves. We compete with bioprosthetic or mechanical valves from companies including Medtronic; Edwards Life Sciences, Inc.; LivaNova; and Abbott Laboratories. Alternatives to our human cardiac patches include xenograft SIS and glutaraldehyde fixed bovine pericardial patches. We compete with these xenograft products from companies including Aziyo Biologics; Edwards Life Sciences, Inc.; Anteris Technologies Ltd. (“Anteris”); Abbott Laboratories; and Baxter. 

We ship human cardiac tissues to implanting institutions throughout the U.S. Our CryoValve SGPV and CryoPatch SG are distributed under 510(k) clearance from the FDA. We also ship limited tissues in Canada and other countries under special access programs. Revenues from cardiac tissue preservation services accounted for 15%, 15%, and 14% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

PhotoFix

PhotoFix is a bovine pericardial patch fixated using a dye-mediated photo-oxidation process without the use of glutaraldehyde. We hold FDA 510(k) clearance and a CE Mark for PhotoFix which is indicated for use in intracardiac repair, great vessel repair, suture line buttressing, pericardial closure, and vascular repair and reconstruction (for example: the carotid, iliac, femoral, and tibial blood vessels as well as arteriovenous access revisions). 

Our PhotoFix product line competes with bioprosthetic and synthetic cardiac and vascular patch offerings from several other companies, including Baxter, LeMaitre, Aziyo Biologics, and Abbott Laboratories based on PhotoFix’s features and benefits, such as the photo-oxidation cross-linking process that does not use glutaraldehyde. 

We sell PhotoFix in North America, EMEA, and APAC. Revenues from PhotoFix accounted for 2%, 1%, and 1% of our total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

Stents and Stent Grafts for Aortic Arch and Thoracic Aortic Repair 

Hybrid stent grafts, surgical grafts, and endovascular stent grafts can be used in the treatment of complex aortic arch and thoracic aortic disease, such as aortic dissections and thoracic aortic aneurysms. 

An aortic dissection occurs when the innermost layer of the aorta tears and blood surges through the tear separating the inner layer from the outer layers of the aorta. Younger patients with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan Syndrome, and patients with bicuspid aortic valves (two leaflets on the valve instead of three) are more likely to develop aortic dissection. Left untreated, an aortic dissection often results in a ruptured aorta, leading to death. 

An aortic aneurysm results from a weakening in the wall of an aorta, which causes the aorta to progressively “balloon” or expand in size. Risk factors for a patient to develop an aortic aneurysm include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and being male. As an aneurysm grows, the wall of the aorta is progressively weakened until it can split or tear, resulting in a ruptured aorta or an aortic dissection.  Left untreated, aortic aneurysms can result in death.

Aortic dissections often begin in the ascending aorta or aortic arch and may also have an aneurysm or an aortic dissection extending down the descending thoracic aorta. Often, the dissection in the aortic arch and the condition in the descending thoracic aorta are repaired in a two-stage procedure, with one open surgical procedure to repair the arch followed by another procedure to repair the descending thoracic aorta. We sell the E-vita® OPEN PLUS and AMDS as well as distribute NEXUS to treat these conditions impacting the aortic arch and thoracic aorta. 

E-vita OPEN PLUS and E-vita OPEN NEO

E-vita OPEN PLUS is a hybrid stent graft system used in the treatment of patients with either an aneurysm or dissection in the aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta. The E-vita OPEN PLUS stent graft system enables a one-stage treatment to repair this condition through a combined surgical and endovascular treatment, providing a more cost-effective solution for the healthcare system and allowing the patient to avoid an additional operation. ‎





We hold a CE Mark for the E-vita OPEN PLUS and additional marketing approvals have been granted in other countries throughout the world. The E-vita OPEN PLUS competes outside the U.S. with products from Terumo Medical Corporation (“Terumo”) and two smaller competitors. We do not currently sell E-vita OPEN PLUS in the U.S. and we believe there are no competitive products currently being commercialized in the U.S. The E-vita OPEN PLUS competes in the EU primarily on its proven stent graft technology and long-term clinical data.

Through our acquisition of JOTEC, we began selling the E-vita OPEN PLUS in many markets outside of the United States in December 2017. Revenues from the E-vita OPEN PLUS accounted for 2%, 2%, and 3% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

The E-vita OPEN NEO is the next generation hybrid stent graft for the E-vita OPEN PLUS that has an improved handling and delivery system. We obtained a CE Mark for E-vita OPEN NEO in the first quarter of 2020 and began limited distribution of E-vita OPEN NEO in the second quarter of 2020 with full product launch in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

AMDS

CryoLife acquired Ascyrus Medical LLC (“Ascyrus”) in September 2020. Ascyrus has developed the Ascyrus Medical Dissection Stent (“AMDS”) hybrid prosthesis, the world's first aortic arch remodeling device for use in the treatment of acute Type A aortic dissection.  Hemi-arch reconstruction is the standard of care for the treatment of acute Type A aortic dissection. AMDS is used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, hemi-arch reconstruction without adding technical complexity to this life-saving procedure.  The design of the AMDS allows for rapid deployment of the graft in the aortic arch during a standard replacement of the ascending aorta, adding on average less than five minutes to the procedure time.  The deployment of the AMDS preserves the native arch, potentially allowing for the minimally invasive re-interventions as needed, including the repair of additional entry tears, rather than an invasive arch repair.  In the Dissected Aorta Repair Through Stent (“DARTS”) clinical trial supporting its CE Mark and Health Canada approvals, the AMDS was shown to reduce mortality, complications and reoperations compared to the standard of care, thereby improving the care of patients and offering significant cost savings for the health care system.

AMDS indirectly competes with other manufacturers’ standard open surgical repair and hybrid procedures including aortic debranching, and frozen elephant trunk technique for total arch replacement. In addition, several manufacturers, including Cook Medical (“Cook”), Gore, Medtronic, and Terumo Aortic are attempting to develop fully endovascular products aimed at treating the ascending aorta. Limited experience exists with these products to date through the custom-made device process in Europe and physician sponsored IDEs within the United States.

Through our acquisition of Ascyrus in September 2020, we began selling AMDS in EMEA and Canada. Revenues from AMDS accounted for less than 1% of total revenues in 2020.

Endovascular and Open Vascular Surgery Markets

Aortic Aneurysm Repair

The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart through the aortic valve to the rest of the body. It extends upwards from the heart through the aortic arch and then down through the chest and into the abdomen, where it divides into larger arteries that supply each leg. The aorta is comprised of five segments: ascending, arch, thoracic, thoraco-abdominal, and abdominal. In some patients, part of the aorta can become abnormally large or bulge, referred to as an “aneurysm.”

An aneurysm results from a weakening in the wall of an aorta, which causes the aorta to progressively “balloon” or expand in size. Although an aneurysm can develop anywhere along the aorta, most occur in the section running through the abdomen (abdominal aortic aneurysms or “AAA”). Others occur in the section that runs through the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysms or “TAA”) or the area between the chest and the abdomen (thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms or “TAAA”). The precise cause of aortic aneurysms is uncertain, but risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and being male. As an aneurysm grows, the wall of the aorta is progressively weakened until it can split or tear resulting in a ruptured aorta or an aortic dissection.  Left untreated, aortic aneurysms can result in death. 




There are two types of aortic aneurysm repair: open surgical repair or endovascular repair. Open surgical repair can result in reasonable long-term survival but carries risks especially in older patients and those with other serious medical conditions. During open surgical repair, a vascular graft is implanted from above the aneurysm to below the aneurysm in the aorta. Blood will then flow through the graft. This surgery reinforces the diseased aorta and reduces the chance of vessel rupture. 

Endovascular repair is a minimally invasive procedure, during which a stent graft is delivered through the femoral artery to the area in the aorta needing repair. The stent graft expands inside the aorta and becomes the new channel for blood flow. The stent graft shields the aneurysm and helps prevent more pressure from building on it, thus preventing it from rupturing.

Following our acquisition of JOTEC, we began commercialization of a broad portfolio of endovascular products for aortic repair. These include highly differentiated products, such as E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING, a portfolio of stent grafts tailor-made for a patient’s anatomy for TAAA repair, and the E-liac for repair of aneurysms in the iliac arteries, as well as less differentiated products, including the E-vita THORACIC 3G for TAA repair and the E-tegra for AAA repair.

E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING 

E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING is a comprehensive range of stent graft systems for the treatment of aortic vascular diseases that enables surgeons to quickly and efficiently respond to individual patient’s therapeutic requirements. E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING are tailor-made for individual patients based on imaging of the patient’s own aorta. There are currently only limited off-the-shelf products to treat aneurysms in the thoraco-abdominal aorta due to the many side branches in this anatomy where blood flow to vital organs would be obstructed by unbranched stent grafts. JOTEC has pioneered a service whereby it manufactures a customized thoraco-abdominal stent graft within 3 weeks. E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING are often used in conjunction with E-vita THORACIC 3G, as well as the AAA offering, the E-tegra, or in combination with both. 

We sell E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING in EMEA and in a limited number of other countries around the world. E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING competes with customized product offerings from Cook and Terumo.

Revenues from E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING accounted for 6%, 5%, and 5% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

E-nside 

The E-nside TAAA multibranch stent graft system is an off-the-shelf stent graft with pre-cannulated inner branches indicated for treatment of patients with thoraco-abdominal disease. The E-nside’s pre-cannulated inner branches are designed to reduce the overall procedure time which reduces the patient’s exposure to radiation. The vast majority of patients with thoraco-abdominal disease are treated with risky, invasive open surgical procedures, characterized by lengthy hospitalization periods and prolonged recuperation, or with custom-made stent grafts which can take up to 90 days to manufacture. We believe the addition of the E-nside positions JOTEC well to capture share in the European aortic stent graft market because E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING, provides patient-specific solutions, and E-nside, provides an off-the-shelf solution. Further, there are synergies between E-nside and JOTEC's existing portfolio of thoracic and abdominal stent grafts. E-nside competes with products from Cook and Terumo.

We obtained a CE Mark for E-nside in the fourth quarter of 2019 and began limited selling of E-nside in the second quarter of 2020. We anticipate full product launch in the first quarter of 2021. 

E-vita THORACIC 3G

The E-vita THORACIC 3G is a stent graft system that enables endovascular treatment of TAAs. Its unique spring configuration gives the stent graft flexibility, helping the stent graft adapt to the vessel's shape and ensuring a good seal at the landing zone, even in the case of complex vascular anatomy. Compared to its competing products, its different proximal and distal stent graft configurations, as well as straight and conical designs, enable individual treatment of the diseased aorta. The product line includes a wide portfolio of tapered versions from proximal to distal. The wide variety ensures the possibility of adapting the stent graft to the native course of the descending aorta. The E-vita THORACIC 3G is sometimes used in conjunction with the E-vita OPEN PLUS and E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING.




We hold a CE Mark for the E-vita THORACIC 3G and additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. The E-vita THORACIC 3G competes primarily with products from Medtronic, Gore, Terumo, and Cook. 

Revenues from the E-vita THORACIC 3G accounted for 2% of total revenues in each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

E-nya

The E-nya is a thoracic stent graft system for the minimally invasive repair of lesions of the descending aorta, including thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. The E-nya system was designed to give physicians more options and control while treating both simple and challenging anatomies. The E-nya builds upon JOTEC’s experience in the thoracic endovascular aortic repair market and increases the number of options to treat a broader range of patients.  The system offers both bare spring and covered proximal configurations with tip capture technology, enhancing control and predictability during deployment while achieving optimal outcomes.  The lower profile graft material leverages JOTEC’s expertise in textile manufacturing and is designed for both flexibility in conformance and long-term durability. E-nya competes primarily with products from Medtronic, Gore, Cook, and Terumo.

We obtained a CE Mark for E-nya in the fourth quarter of 2019 and began limited distribution of E-nya in the second quarter of 2020. We anticipate full product launch in the second half of 2021. 

E-ventus BX

E-ventus BX is a balloon-expandable peripheral stent graft indicated for the endovascular treatment of renal and pelvic arteries in cases of ruptures, dissections, and aneurysms. The E-ventus BX stent graft has high flexibility together with high radial strength through the combination of the microporous single-layer ePTFE cover and the cobalt chromium stent. The E-ventus BX stent graft features minimal recoil and foreshortening and enables secure fixation and positioning in the vessel. The E-ventus BX delivery system has a highly flexible catheter that allows easy advancement in the vessel and enables lesions to be reliably reached by the catheter. Radiopaque markers on the delivery system enable secure and accurate positioning of the stent graft. The E-ventus BX is often used in conjunction with E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING products and the E-liac stent graft.

The E-ventus BX has a CE Mark and additional marketing approvals in several other countries throughout the world. The E-ventus BX competes with products from Maquet, Inc. (“Maquet”), Gore, BD and Bentley InnoMed.

Revenues from the distribution of E-ventus BX accounted for 2%, 3%, and 3% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

E-liac

The E-liac is a stent graft used to treat aneurysmal iliac arteries as well as aneurysmal iliac side branches. The E-liac is a self-expanding stent graft characterized by easy and safe handling, which makes it possible to safely reach the lesion and accurately position the stent graft in the vessel. We estimate that 20% of patients who have an AAA also have an aneurysmal iliac artery, and as such, the E-liac is often used in conjunction with the E-tegra AAA device as well as one or two E-ventus BX devices.

We hold a CE Mark for the E-liac and additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. The E-liac competes with products from Gore and Cook.

Revenues from the E-liac accounted for 2%, of total revenues in each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.




E-tegra

The E-tegra is a AAA stent graft system with special stent design for secure sealing that makes difficult vascular anatomies treatable, thus expanding endovascular treatment options for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. The design of the E-tegra enables optimal fixation and sealing. It is a proximal laser cut stent with anchors for suprarenal stent graft fixation. Its asymmetric stent design and seamless cover ensure excellent adaptation to the vessel. The product also features a low-profile delivery system with its unique squeeze-to-release mechanism supporting the user by ensuring excellent control during each phase of the implantation. The E-tegra is often used in combination with E-xtra DESIGN ENGINEERING and the E-liac.

We hold a CE Mark for the E-tegra and additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. The E-tegra competes with products from several companies, including Medtronic, Gore, Terumo, Endologix, Antegraft, Inc, and Cook.

Revenues from the E-tegra accounted for 5%, 6%, and 5% of total revenues for in each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

NEXUS

JOTEC acquired the exclusive distribution rights in certain countries in Europe for the NEXUS stent graft system (“NEXUS”) in September 2019 from Endospan Ltd., an Israeli corporation (“Endospan”). Endospan holds a CE Mark for NEXUS which is the only endovascular stent graft system approved for the repair of both aneurysms and dissections in the aortic arch. While open surgical repair remains the standard of care for complete aortic arch replacement, endovascular repair offers an alternative, less invasive procedure to treat the aortic arch with decreased surgical morbidity and mortality. The ability to repair the aortic arch with an endovascular approach is especially advantageous for elderly patients who are not suited for open surgery and for patients who were previously treated for a Type A dissection in an open surgical approach. The addition of NEXUS to JOTEC’s highly differentiated aortic stent graft portfolio further strengthens our position as a leader in the aortic repair market. 

Several other manufacturers are introducing competitive products through the custom-made device process in Europe and the early feasibility process within the United States, including the Zenith arch branched device (Cook), the TAG thoracic branch endoprosthesis (Gore), and the Ascending Thoracic Device based on the Relay NBS Plus (Bolton Medical). NEXUS also competes with other manufacturers’ standard open repair and hybrid procedures including aortic debranching, frozen elephant trunk, and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (“TEVAR”) with chimney or snorkels.

We began limited distribution of NEXUS in the fourth quarter of 2019 in EMEA. Revenues from NEXUS accounted for less than 1% of total revenues in each of 2020 and 2019.

We also entered into a securities purchase option agreement with Endospan in September 2019 which provides CryoLife the option to purchase all the outstanding securities of Endospan from Endospan’s securityholders at the time of acquisition (or the option to acquire all of Endospan’s assets) up through a certain period of time after FDA approval of NEXUS.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Patients with peripheral vascular disease can experience reduced blood flow, usually in the arms and legs. This can result in poor circulation, pain, and sores that do not heal. Failure to achieve revascularization of an obstructed vessel may result in the loss of a limb or even death of the patient. When patients require peripheral bypass surgery, the surgeon’s first choice generally is a graft of the patient’s own tissue (an autograft). In cases of advanced vascular disease, however, patients may not have suitable vascular tissue for transplantation. Other artery and vascular repair procedures include procedures related to infected abdominal aortic grafts, vascular access for dialysis patients, carotid endarterectomy, or vessel repair. These procedures may include the use of bioprosthetic grafts or patches, synthetic grafts or patches, or donated human vascular tissues. Alternative treatments may include the repair, partial removal, or complete removal of the damaged tissue.

Bioprosthetic vascular grafts and patches, including those made of bovine or porcine tissue can be used for a variety of vascular repair procedures. Bioprosthetic grafts are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a vascular repair procedure. Bioprosthetic tissues are typically processed with glutaraldehyde, which may result in progressive calcification.




Synthetic vascular grafts and patches can be used for a variety of vascular repair procedures. Synthetic grafts are readily available and are a relatively inexpensive solution for those requiring a vascular repair procedure. Synthetic grafts and patches, however, are generally not suitable for use in infected areas because they may harbor bacteria and are difficult to treat with antibiotics. Synthetic vascular grafts have a tendency to obstruct over time, particularly in below-the-knee surgeries.

Human vascular tissues tend to respond better to treatment for infection and remain open and accessible for longer periods of time and, as such, are used in indications where synthetic grafts typically fail, such as in infected areas and for below-the-knee surgeries. Human vascular and arterial tissues are also used in a variety of other reconstruction procedures such as cardiac bypass surgery and as vascular access grafts for hemodialysis patients. The transplant of human tissue that has not been preserved must be accomplished within extremely short time limits. Cryopreservation expands the treatment options available by extending these timelines.

We market our vascular preservation services, including our CryoVein® and CryoArtery® tissues, and a synthetic surgical graft portfolio for peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries.

Vascular Preservation Services

Our proprietary preservation process involves our dissection, processing, preservation, and storage of tissues until they are shipped to a hospital for implantation by a physician. The vascular tissues currently preserved by us include saphenous veins, aortoiliac arteries, and femoral veins and arteries. Each of these tissues maintains a structure, which more closely resembles and simulates the performance of the patient’s own tissue compared to non-human tissue alternatives. Our vascular tissues are used to treat a variety of vascular reconstructions, such as peripheral bypass, hemodialysis access, and aortic infections, which have saved the lives and limbs of patients. We believe the human tissues we distribute offer specific advantages over synthetic and bioprosthesis alternatives, particularly for the treatment of infection in hemodialysis and peripheral bypass patients. Human tissue is not as susceptible to infection as synthetic alternatives, and more closely simulates the performance of the patient’s own tissue and vasculature compared to non-human tissue alternatives. 

Two other domestic tissue processors, LifeNet, and LeMaitre, offer preserved vascular tissue in competition with us. There are also a number of providers of synthetic and bioprosthetic alternatives to vascular tissues preserved by us and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters. Our vascular tissues compete with products from Gore, BD, LeMaitre, and Maquet.

We believe that we compete favorably with other entities that preserve human vascular tissues on the basis of surgeon preference, documented clinical data, technology, and customer service, particularly with respect to the capabilities of our field representatives. 

We ship human vascular tissues to implanting institutions throughout the U.S. and Canada. Revenues from vascular preservation services accounted for 14%, 14%, and 15% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Synthetic vascular grafts

In addition to our endovascular stent graft offerings, we have a broad line of synthetic vascular grafts that are used in open aortic and peripheral vascular surgical procedures. Our offerings include ePTFE grafts and both woven and knitted polyester grafts. Not only are we able to manufacture and sell a broad line of synthetic vascular graft offerings, but also we are able to manufacture our own nitinol stents, given our expertise in synthetic graft manufacturing. Both of these are used in our stent graft systems. 

Our synthetic surgical vascular grafts have CE Marks and additional marketing approvals have been granted in several other countries throughout the world. 

Our synthetic grafts compete with products from Bard, BD, Gore, LeMaitre, Vascutek Ltd., and Maquet.

Revenues from synthetic surgical vascular grafts accounted for 2%, of total revenues in each of the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.




Other Technologies

Angina Treatment

Angina consists of pressure, discomfort, or pain in the chest typically due to narrowed or blocked arteries, which may result in ischemic heart disease. Patients with severe angina are often treated with surgical procedures including angioplasty or coronary artery bypass or with medications such as aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers, statins, or calcium channel blockers. Pain may be chronic or may become pronounced with exercise. Angina can also be treated with Transmyocardial Revascularization (“TMR”), a procedure that can be performed as an open surgical procedure or through a minimally invasive surgery either as a stand-alone procedure or concurrently with coronary artery bypass. During TMR, the surgeon uses a disposable handpiece to deliver precise bursts of laser energy directly to an area of heart muscle that is suffering from ischemic heart disease through a small incision or small ports with the patient under general anesthesia and without stopping the heart. TMR is typically performed with a CO2 or Holmium: YAG laser. It takes approximately 6 to 10 pulses of the laser to traverse the myocardium and create channels of one millimeter in diameter. During a typical procedure, approximately 20 to 40 channels are made in the heart muscle. The external openings seal with little blood loss. Angina usually subsides with improved oxygen supply to the targeted areas of the damaged heart muscle. We currently sell the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line to perform TMR. 
CardioGenesis Cardiac Laser Therapy

Our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line consists of Holmium: YAG laser consoles, related service and maintenance, and single-use, fiber-optic handpieces, which are used in TMR to treat patients with severe angina resulting from diffuse coronary artery disease. Patients undergoing TMR treatment with CardioGenesis products have been shown to have angina reduction, longer event-free survival, reduction in cardiac related hospitalizations, and increased exercise tolerance. Our SolarGen 2100s Console (“console”) uses the solid-state technology of the Holmium: YAG laser system to provide a stable and reliable energy platform that is designed to deliver precise energy output. The console has an advanced electronic and cooling system technology, which allows for a smaller and lighter system, while providing 115V power capability. We also provide service plan options to ensure that the console is operating within the critical factory specifications. We sell the SoloGrip® III disposable handpieces (“handpieces”), which consist of multiple, fine fiber-optic strands in a one-millimeter diameter bundle and are designed to work with the console. The handpiece has an ergonomic design and is pre-calibrated in the factory to provide easy and convenient access for treating all regions of the left ventricle. See Part 1, Item I, “Business—Suppliers, Sources, and Availability of Raw Materials and Tissues,” for a discussion of the limitations around our supply of handpieces and consoles.

The CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line is FDA approved for treating patients with severe angina that are not responsive to conventional therapy. We began selling the CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line, primarily in the U.S., in May 2011 when we completed the acquisition of Cardiogenesis Corporation. 

Our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy competes with other methods for the treatment of coronary artery disease, including drug therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass surgery, and enhanced external counter pulsation. There is currently no directly competitive laser technology for the performance of TMR as Stryker discontinued the directly competitive CO2 Heart Laser System. Currently, Laser Engineering Inc. services the Stryker laser system, but no more handpieces are being sold. Our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product competes with other methods for the treatment of coronary artery disease on the basis of its ease of use, versatility, size of laser console, and improved access to the treatment area with a smaller fiber-optic system. We did not have a supply of handpieces for cardiac laser therapy while we waited for the FDA to approve our supplier’s change in manufacturing location through our PMA-supplement. In January 2021 we received PMA-S approval for this change in manufacturing site and we anticipate resuming limited sales of TMR handpieces in first half of 2021.

We sell handpieces and consoles primarily in the U.S. Revenues from CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy accounted for less than 1%, 2%, and 2% of total revenues in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 




Hemostats

Hemostatic agents are frequently utilized as an adjunct to sutures and staples to control intraoperative bleeding. Hemostatic agents prevent excess blood loss and can help maintain good visibility of the operative site. These products may reduce operating room time and decrease the number of blood transfusions required in surgical procedures. Hemostatic agents are available in various forms including pads, sponges, liquids, and powders. We currently distribute the powdered hemostatic agent PerClot. 

PerClot

PerClot is an absorbable powdered hemostat, consisting of plant starch modified into ultra-hydrophilic, adhesive-forming hemostatic polymers. PerClot granules are biocompatible, absorbable polysaccharides containing no animal or human components. PerClot granules have a molecular structure that rapidly absorbs water, forming a gelled adhesive matrix that provides a mechanical barrier to any further bleeding and results in the accumulation of platelets, red blood cells, and coagulation proteins (thrombin, fibrinogen, etc.) at the site of application. PerClot does not require additional operating room preparation or special storage conditions and is easy to apply. PerClot is readily dissolved by saline irrigation and is totally absorbed by the body within several days. In September 2010, we entered into a distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with Starch Medical, Inc. (“SMI”), which allows us to distribute PerClot worldwide, except in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, North Korea, Iran, and Syria. We are approved to distribute SMI’s PerClot in approximately 70 countries.

PerClot has a CE Mark and additional marketing approvals have been granted in a number of other countries throughout the world. PerClot is indicated for use in surgical procedures, including cardiac, vascular, orthopaedic, neurological, gynecological, ENT, and trauma surgery as an adjunct hemostat when control of bleeding from capillary, venular, or arteriolar vessels by pressure, ligature, and other conventional means is either ineffective or impractical. 

PerClot competes with various topical absorbable hemostats including offerings from Pfizer, Inc., Baxter, Ethicon, Bard, and BioCer Entwicklungs-GmbH. Other competitive products may include topical thrombin and fibrin sealants. A number of companies have surgical hemostat products under development. PerClot competes on the basis of safety, clinical efficacy, absorption rates, and ease of use. 

In January 2019 we completed enrolling patients in a clinical trial for the purpose of obtaining FDA Premarket Approval (“PMA”) to sell PerClot in the U.S., as discussed further in “Research and Development and Clinical Research” below. We anticipate PMA submission to the FDA during the third quarter of 2021. Revenues from PerClot accounted for 1% of total revenues in each of 2020, 2019, and 2018. 

Vascular Access

End-stage renal disease (“ESRD”) refers to the stage of renal disease when the kidneys do not work well enough for the patient to live without on-going dialysis or kidney transplant. Patients with ESRD often undergo hemodialysis through an access site with an implanted vascular graft. We market our CryoVein femoral vein and CryoArtery femoral artery vascular preservation services for vascular access.
Marketing and Distribution

In the U.S and Canada, we market our products and preservation services primarily to physicians and sell our products through our approximately 50-person direct sales team to hospitals and other healthcare facilities. We also have a team of regional managers, a national accounts manager, and sales and marketing management. Through our field representatives and our physician relations and education department, we conduct field training for surgeons regarding the surgical applications of our products and tissues.

In EMEA, we market our products through JOTEC, based in Hechingen, Germany, as well as through several other subsidiaries based throughout Europe. We employ approximately 90 direct field service representatives and distributor managers in Germany, the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, and Ireland in the EMEA region. We provide customer service, logistics, marketing, and clinical support to cardiac, vascular, thoracic, and general surgeons throughout the EMEA region.




In Asia Pacific and Latin America, we commercialize our products through our independent distributors and our subsidiaries through approximately 23 sales and clinical support specialists.

Our physician relations and education staff, clinical research staff, and field representatives assist physicians by providing educational materials, seminars, and clinics on methods for using our products and implanting tissue preserved by us, including virtual and remote programs in 2020. We sponsor programs, and work with other companies such as Endospan to sponsor programs, where surgeons train other surgeons in best-demonstrated techniques. In addition, we host several workshops throughout the year that provide didactic and hands-on training to surgeons. We also produce educational videos for physicians and coordinate peer-to-peer training at various medical institutions. We believe that these activities enhance the medical community’s understanding of the clinical benefits of the products and tissues offered by us and help to differentiate us from other medical device companies and tissue processors. 

Our human tissues are obtained in the U.S. through organ and tissue procurement organizations (“OPOs”) and tissue banks. To assist OPOs and tissue banks, we provide educational materials and training on procurement, dissection, packaging, and shipping techniques. We produce educational videos and coordinate laboratory sessions for OPO and tissue bank personnel to improve their recovery techniques and increase the yield of usable tissue. We also maintain staff 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, for OPO and tissue bank support.

Suppliers, Sources, and Availability of Raw Materials and Tissues

We obtain a number of our raw materials and supplies from a small group of suppliers or a single- or sole-source supplier. Certain raw materials and components used in our products and tissue processing have stringent specifications. Supply interruptions or supplier quality, financial, regulatory or operational issues could cause us to have to temporarily reduce, temporarily halt, or permanently halt manufacturing, processing, marketing, selling or distribution activities. Ongoing sustaining efforts are in process to find alternative suppliers for single- or sole-source raw materials and supplies wherever feasible. The process of qualifying alternative suppliers could result in additional costs or lengthy delays or may not be possible. Any of these adverse outcomes could have a material, adverse effect on our revenues or profitability. Supplies of materials are discussed for each of our main products and services below. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Operational Risks.”

Our BioGlue product has three main product components: bovine protein, a cross linker, and a molded plastic resin delivery device. The bovine protein and cross linker are obtained from a small number of qualified suppliers. The delivery devices are manufactured by a single supplier, using resin supplied by a single supplier. We maintain an inventory of finished delivery devices to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption.

We purchase grafts for our On-X AAP from a single supplier. We also purchase various components for our On-X valves from single suppliers. We maintain inventories of these grafts and components to help mitigate the effects of a potential supply interruption. 

We purchase handpieces for our CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy product line from a separate single-source contract manufacturer. In addition, this manufacturer obtains certain fiber-optic components and subassemblies from single sources. Our manufacturer of handpieces has been unable to supply handpieces until the FDA recently approved our supplier’s change in manufacturing location through approval of our PMA supplement. On January 21, 2021 we received notice that the FDA had approved our PMA supplement. We currently anticipate resumption of supply during the first half of 2021. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Operational Risks—We are dependent on single- and sole-source suppliers and single facilities.” In addition, we no longer have a supplier for consoles and do not intend to manufacture consoles in the future, although we will continue to sell consoles in our inventory and provide parts and service for customers with whom we have service contracts for laser consoles. 

We purchase PerClot for distribution from SMI pursuant to the above referenced agreements. We maintain an inventory of PerClot purchased from SMI to supply our customer orders and place orders for additional product from SMI to maintain inventory at appropriate levels based on demand. Our business may be subject to interruption if SMI were unable or became unwilling to supply PerClot to us for a sustained period of time.




Our preservation services business and our ability to supply needed tissues is dependent upon donation of tissues from human donors by donor families. Donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by OPOs and tissue banks. We must rely on the OPOs and tissue banks that we work with to educate the public on the need for donation, to foster a willingness to donate tissue, to follow our donor screening and procurement procedures, and to send donated tissue to us. We have active relationships with 58 OPOs and tissue banks throughout the U.S. We believe these relationships with our OPOs are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides us with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market. 

We also use various raw materials, including medicines and solutions, in our tissue processing.  Some of these raw materials are manufactured by single suppliers or by a small group of suppliers.  All of these factors subject us to risk of supply interruption. In the fourth quarter of 2020 we became aware that a supplier shipped to us a lot of saline solution that we use in our tissue processing that contained some contamination. The contamination was identified by our in-process quality controls. The contaminated solution is currently estimated to have impacted a small percentage of the tissue processed with this lot of solution, causing us to write-off those contaminated tissues. We are conducting further review to determine if remaining tissue processed with this lot of solution can be released for distribution. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Preservation Services,” see also Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors – Operational Risks – We are dependent on single- and sole-source suppliers and single facilities.”

The endovascular stent graft systems consist of two main product components: the stent graft and the delivery system. ‎The stent graft is manufactured out of several different raw materials that are manufactured by JOTEC and various external suppliers, including single suppliers. The delivery systems are manufactured by JOTEC from several different raw materials with different processing techniques.  Primary processes are the assembly of injection molded parts and machine drilled parts, suturing of stent grafts, processing of Nitinol, and weaving of textiles. 

The conventional polyester grafts consist of two main product components: polyester fabric and collagen coating. ‎The polyester fabric is manufactured by JOTEC out of a few different yarns that are supplied by an external supplier. The collagen suspension is manufactured by JOTEC out of a collagenous tissue that is supplied by a single supplier. 

The conventional ePTFE grafts are manufactured by JOTEC out of various raw materials supplied by several suppliers. For some products the ePTFE grafts are heparin coated.  For these products, the heparin suspension is manufactured by JOTEC out of a heparin solution that is also supplied by an external supplier. 

The NEXUS product is solely manufactured by Endospan in Herzelia, Israel, and our AMDS product is solely manufactured by our supplier in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Operations, Manufacturing, and Tissue Preservation

We maintain a facility, which contains our corporate headquarters and laboratory space, and an additional off-site warehouse in Kennesaw, Georgia. We manufacture BioGlue and PhotoFix and process human tissues at our headquarters facility. Our headquarters also includes a CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy console maintenance and evaluation laboratory space. 

We maintain a facility of combined manufacturing and office space in Atlanta, Georgia, and additional office space in Kennesaw, Georgia, both of which we currently sublet to third-parties. Our Atlanta facility was sublet beginning in 2018 and our Kennesaw, Georgia additional space was sublet beginning in 2016.

Our On-X facility consists of combined manufacturing, warehouse, and office space in Austin, Texas, where our On-X products, including On-X heart valves and AAPs, are manufactured. 

Our JOTEC facility consists of combined manufacturing, warehousing, and office space in Hechingen, Germany and is our EMEA headquarters. 

We also maintain sales offices, some of which have distribution operations in Brazil, the U.K., Italy, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland. See also Part I, Item 2, “Properties.”




In all of our facilities, we are subject to regulatory standards for good manufacturing practices, including current Quality System Regulations, which are the FDA regulatory requirements for medical device manufacturers, and current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTPs”), which are the FDA regulatory requirements for the processing of human tissue. We also operate according to International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 Quality System Requirements, an internationally recognized voluntary system of quality management for companies that design, develop, manufacture, distribute, and service medical devices. We maintain a Certification of Approval to ISO 13485. 

The Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) is the governing document for the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that details requirements for safety and risk of devices.  Currently scheduled to be fully implemented by May 26, 2021 the Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) will replace MDD and will impose more stringent requirements on manufacturers and European Notified Bodies, who have already begun the transition to these new requirements. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Industry Risks—Our products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks,” for a discussion of risks related to the transition to MDR. 

We work with a number of organizations officially designated as Notified Bodies by European Union Member States to perform assessments of compliance to the MDD and MDR for our various product lines. These organizations include LNE/G-Med (“G-Med”), Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Überwachungs-Verein (“DEKRA”), the British Standards Institute (“BSI”), and DQS Holding GmbH (“DQS”). These organizations as well as Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (“LRQA”) also perform assessments and issue certifications affirming compliance to quality system standard ISO 13485:2016. In addition, we work with auditing organizations BSI and DEKRA to perform assessments affirming compliance to the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”), which certifies conformance to the regulations of five key jurisdictions: the U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. 

On June 13, 2019 LRQA informed us that it would no longer provide Notified Body services for medical devices effective September 2019.  The governing German competent authority, the Regierungspraesidium-Tubingen, has granted us an extended grace period until December 31, 2021 to transfer LRQA-issued certifications for BioGlue and PhotoFix to a new Notified Body.  We are currently in the process of transferring to a new Notified Body for BioGlue and PhotoFix.  See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Industry Risks—Our products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks,” for a discussion of the risks related to LRQA’s decision.

We employ a comprehensive quality assurance program in our product manufacturing and tissue preservation activities. Materials, solutions, and components utilized in our manufacturing and tissue processing are received and inspected by trained quality control personnel according to written specifications and standard operating procedures. Those items found to comply with our standards are utilized in our operations. Materials, components, subassemblies, and tissues are documented throughout manufacturing or processing to assure traceability. 

We evaluate and inspect both our manufactured and distributed products to ensure conformity to product specifications. Processes are validated to review whether products manufactured meet our specifications. Each process is documented along with inspection results, including final finished product inspection and acceptance. Records are maintained as to the consignees of products to track product performance and to facilitate product removals or corrections, if necessary.

We maintain controls over our tissue processing to ensure conformity with our procedures. OPOs and tissue banks must follow our procedures related to tissue recovery practices and are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance. Samples are taken from donated tissue for microbiological testing, and tissue must be shown to be free of certain detectable microbial contaminants before being released for distribution. Tissue processing records and donor information are reviewed to identify characteristics that would disqualify the tissue for processing or implantation. Once tissue is released for distribution, it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status. Tissue is stored by us until it is shipped to a hospital, where the tissue is thawed and implanted immediately or held in a liquid nitrogen freezer pending implantation. 

Government Regulation

Medical devices and human tissues are subject to a number of regulations from various government bodies including the U.S., federal, state, and local governments, as well as various international regulatory bodies. Government regulations are continually evolving, and requirements may change with or without notice. Changes in government regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing government regulations could have a material, adverse impact on us. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks related to government regulations.
U.S. Federal Regulation of Medical Devices

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) provides that, unless exempted by regulation, medical devices may not be distributed in the U.S. unless they have been approved or cleared by the FDA. Medical devices may receive clearance through either a 510(k) process or an approval through an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) and PMA process.

Under a Section 510(k) process, a medical device manufacturer provides premarket notification that it intends to begin commercializing a product and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed predicate product. To be found substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device must be for the same intended use and have either the same technological characteristics or different technological characteristics that do not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness. In some cases, the submission must include data from clinical studies in order to demonstrate substantial equivalency to a predicate device. Commercialization may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence. 

FDA regulations require approval through the IDE/PMA process for all Class III medical devices and for medical devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a predicate device. An IDE authorizes distribution of devices that lack PMA or 510(k) clearance for clinical evaluation purposes. After a product is subjected to clinical testing under an IDE, we may file a PMA application. Once a PMA application has been submitted, the FDA’s review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data, which may require us to undertake additional human clinical studies. Commercialization of the device may begin when the FDA approves the PMA.

The FDCA requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the FDA annually and to provide the FDA with a list of those medical devices they distribute commercially. The FDCA also requires manufacturers of medical devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with Quality System Regulations, which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in compliance with good manufacturing practices, including: design, document production, process, labeling, and packaging controls, process validation, and other applicable quality control activities. The FDA’s medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the FDA on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA further requires that certain medical devices that may not be sold in the U.S. follow certain procedures before they are exported. The FDA periodically inspects our facilities to review our compliance with these and other regulations and has authority to seize non-complying medical devices, enjoin and/or impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non-complying medical devices, criminally prosecute violators, and order recalls in certain instances.

The following products are, or we believe would be, upon approval, classified as Class III medical devices: BioGlue, On-X heart valves, On-X AAP, PerClot, CardioGenesis cardiac laser therapy, E-vita OPEN PLUS, E-Vita OPEN NEO, E-vita THORACIC 3G, E-tegra, E-liac, E-nya, E-nside, NEXUS, and AMDS. CryoPatch SG is classified as a Class II medical device. We obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to commercialize the CryoValve SGPV; however, these tissues are not officially classified as Class II or III medical devices. 

In December 2019 we learned that the FDA is preparing to issue a proposed rule for reclassification of more than minimally manipulated (“MMM”) allograft heart valves, including our CryoValve SGPV, from unclassified medical devices to a Class III medical devices. Following a comment period and subsequent publication of a final rule, should the CryoValve SGPV be determined to be MMM, we expect to have approximately thirty months to submit a PMA application, after which the FDA will determine if, and for how long, we may continue to provide these tissues to customers during review of the PMA application. To date, the FDA has not issued a final rule for reclassification of MMM allograft heart valves. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Industry Risks— Reclassification by the FDA of CryoValve SGPV may make it commercially infeasible to continue processing the CryoValve SGPV”.  




U.S. Federal Regulation of Human Tissue

The FDA regulates human tissues pursuant to Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act, which in turn provides the regulatory framework for regulation of human cellular and tissue products. The FDA regulations focus on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of HIV-1 and -2, Hepatitis B and C, and other communicable diseases and disease agents. The regulations set minimum requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation. The regulations define human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is (i) intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease and (ii) recovered, preserved, stored, or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics. The FDA definition excludes, among other things, tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug, biological product, or medical device, and it also excludes kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or any other vascularized human organ. The current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability, processing standards, establishment registration, product listing, testing, and screening for risks of communicable diseases. The FDA periodically audits our tissue preservation facilities for compliance with its requirements and has the authority to enjoin the distribution, force a recall, or require the destruction of tissues that do not meet its requirements. 

NOTA Regulation

Our activities in preserving and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the National Organ Transplant Act (“NOTA”), which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce. NOTA excludes from the definition of “valuable consideration” reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of a human organ. The purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services. We believe that, to the extent our activities are subject to NOTA, we meet this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of our charges.

State Licensing Requirements

Some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the manufacture, sale, marketing or distribution of medical devices, and we believe we are in compliance with such applicable state laws and regulations.

Some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the preservation, transportation, and storage of human organs and tissues. The activities we engage in require us to be either licensed or registered as a clinical laboratory or tissue bank under California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Oregon law. We have such licenses or registrations, and we believe we are in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store, preserve, and distribute donated human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings. 

Some of our employees have obtained other required state licenses. The regulatory bodies of states may perform inspections of our facilities as required to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations. 

International Approval Requirements

Sales of medical devices and shipments of human tissues outside the U.S. are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained and compliance with applicable regulations for tissues must be met prior to commercial distribution of the products or human tissues in those countries. The time required to obtain these approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Countries in which we distribute products and tissue may perform inspections of our facilities to ensure compliance with local country regulations.




The EEA recognizes a single medical device approval CE Mark which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the EEA without additional general applications in each country. Individual EEA members, however, reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing. Third-parties called “Notified Bodies” award the CE Mark. These Notified Bodies are approved and subject to review by the “Competent Authorities” of their respective countries. Our Notified Bodies perform periodic on-site inspections to independently review our compliance with systems and regulatory requirements. A number of countries outside of the EEA accept the CE Mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that country’s application process. We have CE Marks for BioGlue, On-X heart valves, On-X AAP, On-X Chord-X sutures, PhotoFix, E-vita OPEN PLUS, E-vita OPEN NEO, E-vita THORACIC 3G, E-tegra, E-liac, E-nya, E-nside, AMDS, and other devices. We are currently addressing the cessation of LRQA as a Notified Body as it pertains to our BioGlue and PhotoFix CE Mark certifications. In addition, PerClot, E-ventus and NEXUS, which we distribute, have CE Marks.

As a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, or “Brexit,” the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has announced that CE Marking will continue to be recognized in the U.K. and certificates issued by EU-recognized Notified bodies will continue to be valid in the U.K. market until June 30, 2023. Going forward, all devices marketed in the U.K. will require U.K. Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) Marks certified by a U.K. Approved Body (the re-designation of the U.K. Notified Body). See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Industry Risks— Our products and tissues are highly regulated and subject to significant quality and regulatory risks.” 

Environmental Matters

Our tissue preservation activities generate some biomedical wastes, consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes, including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures. The biomedical wastes generated by us are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by us. We contract with third-parties for transport, treatment, and disposal of biomedical waste. Some of our products, including our On-X products, are sterilized using ethylene oxide (“EtO”). Although we have a small-scale EtO facility in Austin, Texas, we rely primarily on large-scale EtO facilities to sterilize our products. In addition, some of our suppliers use, or rely upon third parties to use, EtO to sterilize some of our product components. Concerns about the release of EtO into the environment at unsafe levels have led to various regulatory enforcement activities against EtO facilities, including closures and temporary closures, as well as proposals increasing regulations related to EtO. Although we believe we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, regarding the disposal of our waste regarding tissue preservation activities, as well as in our other production and sterilization activities, the failure by us, or the companies with which we contract, to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties, fines, or sanctions, which could materially, adversely affect our business. See also, Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Legal, Quality, and Regulatory Risks—Some of our products and technologies are subject to significant intellectual property risks and uncertainty,” for additional discussion of risks related to our use of EtO sterilization. We do not currently anticipate compliance with these laws and regulations relating to our waste disposal and sterilization activities will require any material capital expenditures.
Backlog

As of December 31, 2020, we did not have a firm backlog of orders related to BioGlue, On-X heart valves, PerClot, or PhotoFix. The limited supply of certain types or sizes of preserved tissue can result in a backlog of orders for these tissues. The amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases. Our backlog of human tissue consists mostly of pediatric tissues that have limited availability. Our backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment. Certain JOTEC products are specifically designed to meet specifications of a particular patient which can result in a limited backlog of these products. We have not had a supply of handpieces for cardiac laser therapy while we waited for the FDA to approve our supplier’s change in manufacturing location through our PMA-supplement. On January 21, 2021 we received notice that the FDA had approved our PMA supplement. We currently anticipate resumption of supply during the first half of 2021. 
Research and Development and Clinical Research

We use our technical and scientific expertise to identify market opportunities for new products or services, or to expand the use of our current products and services, through expanded indications or product or tissue enhancements. Our research and development strategy is to allocate most of our available resources among our core market areas based on the potential market size, estimated development time and cost, and the expected efficacy for any potential product or service offering. To the extent we identify new non-core products or additional applications for our core products, we may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development or seek funding from outside sources to continue commercial development. We may also attempt to acquire or license additional strategically complementary products or technologies from third-parties to supplement our product lines.

Research on these and other projects is conducted in our research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where we sponsor research projects. We also conduct preclinical and clinical studies at universities, medical centers, hospitals, and other third-party locations under contract with us. Research is inherently risky, and any potential products or tissues under development ultimately may not be deemed safe or effective or worth commercializing for other reasons and, therefore, may not generate a return on investment for us. Our clinical research department also collects and maintains clinical data on the use and effectiveness of our products and services. We use this data to gain regulatory approvals to market the products and services, to inform third-parties on the benefits of our products and services, and to help direct our continuing improvement efforts. 

In 2020, 2019, and 2018 we spent approximately $24.2 million, $23.0 million, and $23.1 million, respectively, on research and development activities on new and existing products. These amounts accounted for approximately 10%, 8%, and 9% of our revenues for each of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

We are in the process of developing or investigating several new products and technologies, as well as changes and enhancements to our existing products and services. Our strategies for driving growth include new product approvals or indications, global expansion, and business development. These activities will likely require additional research, new clinical studies, and/or compilation of clinical data. 

We are currently seeking regulatory approval for BioGlue in China. Enrollment was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and the submission for market approval was filed in March 2019 with Chinese regulatory authorities. 

We are currently conducting clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of an additional size of the On-X aortic heart valve. This study is ongoing, and enrollment will continue through 2021.

We are currently conducting a clinical trial to assess reduced levels of required anticoagulation or warfarin for the On-X mitral heart valve. This study is ongoing, and enrollment was completed in 2019. Follow-up data collection on these patients will continue through 2021. We anticipate PMA submission to the FDA mid 2021.

At the FDA’s request, we are conducting a post-approval study to collect long-term clinical data for the On-X aortic heart valve managed with reduced warfarin therapy. This study is ongoing and data collection is expected to continue into the fourth quarter of 2021.

We have initiated the PROACT Xa clinical trial to determine if patients with an On-X aortic heart valve can be maintained safely and effectively on apixaban (Eliquis®) rather than on warfarin. In December 2019 we received authorization from the FDA pursuant to an Investigational New Drug application to begin the PROACT Xa clinical trial. This study is ongoing with the first patient enrolled in May 2020 and enrollment will continue through 2021.

We are conducting our pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize PerClot for surgical indications in the U.S. Enrollment was completed in January 2019. We anticipate PMA submission to the FDA during the third quarter of 2021. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Operational Risks—Our investment in PerClot is subject to significant risks, including our ability to fully realize our investment by obtaining FDA approval and to successfully commercialize PerClot in the U.S. either directly or indirectly.” 

We will be conducting a pivotal clinical trial to gain approval to commercialize the AMDS hybrid prosthesis in the U.S. for treatment of acute Type A aortic dissections. We anticipate IDE approval in the fourth quarter of 2021 followed by study initiation and first patient enrollment. 




The FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation in the second quarter of 2020, for E-vita OPEN NEO, our next-generation hybrid stent graft system used in the treatment of patients with either an aneurysm or dissection in the aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta. The Breakthrough Device Designation program is designed to provide timely access to medical devices that potentially provide a more effective treatment for life-threatening conditions by prioritizing review of its regulatory submissions, thereby expediting the device development process. We expect to submit an IDE application for E-vita OPEN NEO to initiate an Early Feasibility clinical trial in the US in late 2021.

Patents, Licenses, and Other Proprietary Rights

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, confidentiality agreements, and security procedures to protect our proprietary products, preservation technology, trade secrets, and know-how. We believe that our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and technology licensing rights provide us with important competitive advantages. We currently own rights to numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to our technology for various product lines. There can be no assurance that any pending applications will ultimately be issued as patents. We have also obtained rights through license and distribution agreements for additional products and technologies, including PerClot and NEXUS. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our businesses; however, with the exception of BioGlue as discussed below, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole.

The main patent for BioGlue expired in mid-2012 in the U.S. and expired in mid-2013 in the majority of the rest of the world. Although the patents for BioGlue have expired, this technology is still protected by trade secrets and manufacturing know-how, as well as the time and expense to obtain regulatory approvals.

We have confidentiality agreements with our employees, our consultants, and our third-party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the obligations of our employees, consultants, and third-parties, with whom we have entered into confidentiality agreements, will effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide meaningful protection for our confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure, or that our trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by our competitors. 

See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Legal, Quality, and Regulatory Risks—Some of our products and technologies are subject to significant intellectual property risks and uncertainty,” for a discussion of risks related to our patents, licenses, and other proprietary rights.

Seasonality 

See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Seasonality,” regarding seasonality of our products and services.

Human Capital

As of December 31, 2020 we had approximately 1,200 employees. Most of our employees are located in Kennesaw, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Hechingen, Germany, where our employees have a Works Council. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes. We believe our relations with our employees worldwide and with the Works Council in Germany are good.

Our business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key personnel, including qualified personnel with medical device and tissue processing experience, and senior management with experience in the medical device or tissue processing space, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our business and future operating results, including production at our manufacturing and tissue processing facilities, also depend in significant part on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, operations, processing, marketing, sales, and support personnel for our operations. Our main facilities are in Kennesaw, Georgia; Austin, Texas; and Hechingen, Germany, where the local supply of qualified personnel in the medical device and tissue processing industries is limited and competition for such personnel is intense. We have programs and processes in place to help ensure that our compensation and benefits programs, and our work environment, attract and retain such personnel. See also Part II, Item 7, “Effects of COVID-19” for discussion about COVID-19’s impact on our employees.
