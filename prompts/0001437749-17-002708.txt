Item 1. Business
 
Viveve designs, develops, manufactures and markets a medical device for the non-invasive treatment of vaginal introital laxity, for improved sexual function, and for vaginal rejuvenation, depending on the relevant country-specific clearance or approval, that we refer to as Geneveve™. Women can develop vaginal laxity for a number of reasons, including aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and/or the trauma of natural childbirth. Vaginal laxity can often cause decreased sexual function and satisfaction in women, yet most surveyed physicians who practice obstetrics and gynecology (“OB/GYNs”) and urogynecologists recognize that it is an underreported, yet bothersome, medical condition that impacts relationship happiness as well as sexual function. Currently, few medical treatments are available to effectively treat vaginal laxity. The most widely prescribed treatments include Kegel exercises, although, to our knowledge, there is no validated evidence indicating that Kegel exercises improve vaginal laxity, and surgical procedures, which are not only invasive and expensive but sometimes lead to worse outcomes as a result of scarring. At this time, Geneveve™ is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis in the United States, but the device has not been cleared or approved for use for the treatment of vaginal laxity, to improve sexual function, or for vaginal rejuvenation in the United States. Accordingly, the Company is prohibited under current U.S. regulations from promoting it to physicians or consumers for these unapproved uses.

Geneveve is a non-invasive solution for vaginal laxity which includes three major components: the Viveve System™ (an RF, or radio frequency, generator housed in a table-top console), a reusable handpiece and a single-use treatment tip, as well as several other consumable accessories. Physicians attach the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece, which is connected to the console. The generator authenticates the treatment tip and programs the system for the desired treatment without further physician intervention. The treatment is performed in a physician’s office, in less than 30 minutes, and does not require the use of anesthesia. The tissue tightening effect resulting from Geneveve has been demonstrated by our pre-clinical and clinical research.
 
We believe that Geneveve provides a number of benefits for physicians and patients, including:
 

● | a non-invasive, non-ablative alternative to surgery with no identified safety issues to date;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | it requires only a single treatment;
--+-------------------------------------


● | compelling physician economics; and
--+------------------------------------


● | ease of use.
--+-------------

 
Currently, Geneveve is cleared for marketing in 51 countries throughout the world under the following indications for use: 
 

Indication for Use: | No. of Countries: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis | 3 (including the United States)
For treatment of vaginal laxity | 34 
For treatment of the vaginal introitus, after vaginal childbirth, to improve sexual function | 13 
For vaginal rejuvenation | 1 

 
In the U.S., Geneveve is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis and we market and sell through a direct sales force to health care practitioners. Outside the U.S., we market and sell through an extensive network of distribution partners. 
 
Our goal is to become the leading provider of non-invasive solutions to treat vaginal laxity by:
 

● | Increasing the Number of Installed Base of Viveve Systems. In our existing markets, we plan to (i) expand the number of Viveve Systems from our initial base of early adopters by leveraging our current and future clinical study results and through innovative marketing programs directed at both physicians and patients, where permissible by law, and (ii) expand our efforts and obtain regulatory approvals in additional markets, although there are no assurances that we will ever receive such approvals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Driving Increased Treatment Tip Usage. We work collaboratively with our physician customer base to increase treatment tip usage by enhancing customer awareness and facilitating the marketing efforts of our physician customers to their patients. We intend to launch innovative marketing programs with physician customers to develop a profitable Geneveve practice.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broadening Our Physician Customer Base. While our initial focus is on marketing our procedure to the OB/GYN specialty, we intend to selectively expand our sales efforts into other physician specialties, such as plastic surgery, dermatology, urology, urogynecology, general surgery and family practice. Additionally, we intend to pursue sales from physician-directed medi-spas with track records of safe and successful aesthetic treatments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing New Treatment Tips and System Enhancements. We intend to continue to expand our line of treatment tips to allow for even shorter procedure times to benefit both physicians and patients. We also plan to pursue potential system modifications and next generation enhancements that will further increase the ease-of-use of Geneveve.

As of December 31, 2016, we have sold 217 Viveve Systems and approximately 4,050 single-use treatment tips in countries outside of the U.S.
 
On September 23, 2014, Viveve Medical, Inc. (formerly PLC Systems, Inc.), a Delaware corporation (“Viveve Medical”, “Viveve”, “we”, “us” or “our”) completed a reverse acquisition and recapitalization pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among PLC Systems Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of PLC Systems Inc., with and into Viveve, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Merger”). In conjunction with the Merger, we changed our name from PLC Systems Inc. to Viveve Medical, Inc. to better reflect our new business. Viveve Medical competes in the women’s health industry by marketing the Geneveve™ product as a way to improve the overall sexual well-being and quality of life of women suffering from vaginal laxity, depending on the relevant country-specific clearance or approval. We are currently located at 150 Commercial Street, Sunnyvale, California and our telephone number is (408) 530-1900. We plan to relocate the corporate headquarters toward the end of the first quarter of 2017 as discussed in Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Events. Our website can be accessed at www.viveve.com.

Market Overview
 
Overview of Vaginal Laxity
 
Vaginal laxity and tissue architecture have often been overlooked as contributing etiological factors to female sexual dysfunction. Vaginal laxity can lead to diminished physical sensation during intercourse. This reduction in sensation is often coupled with a reduction in sexual satisfaction, all of which can also impact a woman’s sense of sexual self-esteem and her relationship with her sexual partner. 
 
Vaginal laxity is rarely discussed in the clinical situation, yet most surveyed OB/GYNs and urogynecologists recognize that it is an underreported, yet bothersome, medical condition that impacts relationship happiness and sexual function.1 Another survey of OB/GYNs, found that vaginal laxity is the most frequent physical change seen or discussed post-vaginal delivery2. Additionally, in a survey of women ranging from 25-45 years of age, who had experienced at least one vaginal delivery, approximately half expressed some degree of concern over “looseness” of the vaginal introitus.3

Women can develop vaginal laxity for a number of reasons, including aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and/or trauma. As women age, slower cellular renewal coupled with reduced vascular and glandular networks contributes to loss of underlying supportive fibrous tissue. Some women may have underlying pathophysiological issues with collagen formation, remodeling and repair; and their lifestyle choices (e.g., alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and excessive food consumption) also play a role in the integrity of vaginal tissue. Vaginal trauma (e.g., childbirth, surgery, self-stimulation, or coitus) can also contribute to vaginal laxity.

All women who have given birth vaginally undergo stretching of the tissues of the vaginal opening to accommodate the fetal head. Often the effects are permanent and many women have long-term physical and psychological consequences including sexual dissatisfaction. One significant issue is the loosening of the introitus ─ the vaginal opening. This happens with the first vaginal delivery and usually is made worse with subsequent vaginal deliveries. Vaginal laxity can result in decreased sexual pleasure for both women and their partners during intercourse. We believe that this condition is not frequently discussed because women are embarrassed, fear that their concerns will be dismissed or fear that their physicians will not understand. Physicians hesitate to discuss the situation with their patients because historically there has been no safe and effective treatment. Physicians frequently recommend Kegel exercises. However, these exercises only strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and do not address the underlying cause of vaginal laxity – loss of tissue elasticity. While surgery can be performed to tighten the vaginal canal, the formation of scar tissue from the surgery may lead to painful intercourse and permanent side effects.
 
As a consequence of the physical tissue damage that can result from childbirth, a significant decrease in sexual satisfaction has been reported in women who underwent vaginal delivery, when assessed two years after delivery, in comparison with those who underwent elective caesarian section. In the past several years there has been a marked increase in the number of women requesting delivery by caesarian section with the intention of preventing damage to the pelvic floor and introitus. Caesarian sections are not without risk to both the baby and mother. Whether or not to agree to a woman’s request for an elective caesarian section has generated considerable controversy among obstetricians. If a procedure were available to address the concerns of women about vaginal laxity, we believe the perceived need to have a caesarian section to prevent vaginal tissue damage may decrease significantly.

Market for a Proven Solution to Vaginal Laxity
 
In 2009, we sponsored several on-line marketing surveys in the U.S. with both OB/GYNs and women, ages 25-55, to assess attitudes of physicians and women about vaginal laxity and towards a safe, non-invasive solution to treat this condition.

● | Physician Survey: An OB/GYN marketing survey was conducted by OB/GYN Alliance with nearly 525 practicing OB/GYNs from across the U.S. The objectives of the study were to: obtain insights from physicians on physical changes resulting from childbirth and the corresponding sexual health implications for patients; understand the perceptions and opinions of OB/GYN physicians on a procedure that could be offered to address vaginal laxity following childbirth; and gain an understanding of whom the early adopters may be of Geneveve.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer Survey: In a consumer marketing survey conducted by Q&A Research, 421 women were screened for vaginal delivery, age (25-55), income, education and other factors. The objectives of the survey were to assess the need for Geneveve and better understand the complexity of emotions and the psychological profile of women who experience, but do not discuss, vaginal changes post childbirth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Results from these surveys suggested that vaginal laxity is a significant unmet medical need, and that patients and physicians would benefit significantly from a safe and effective non-invasive treatment that would also increase physical sensation and sexual satisfaction following vaginal childbirth. Of the 421 patient respondents, up to 48% felt that vaginal laxity was a concern post-childbirth. Furthermore, it is evident that patients and their OB/GYNs are not discussing vaginal laxity on a regular basis; in fact, we believe such conversations occur quite infrequently due to many factors, including patient embarrassment and fear of being ridiculed, lack of time and lack of solutions for physicians. Of the nearly 525 OB/GYNs surveyed, 84% indicated that vaginal laxity is the number one post-delivery physical change for women, being more prevalent than weight gain, urinary incontinence and stretch marks, and believe that it is under-reported by their patients. Additionally, in a separate international survey of urogynecologists, 83% of the 563 respondents described vaginal laxity as underreported by their patients and the majority considered it a bothersome condition that impacts sexual function and relationships. Despite the lack of communication regarding this issue, we believe there is a strong interest among patients and doctors for a treatment that is clinically proven and safe.

Applying U.S. census data, CDC Vital Statistics data and our projections as a result of these studies, we estimate there are approximately 6 million post-partum women who are potential candidates for this procedure in the U.S. alone, approximately 3 million of whom could be early adopters for Geneveve.
 
In 2012, we conducted a similar consumer study in Japan and Canada in order to understand cultural differences that may exist towards vaginal laxity and Geneveve. The results corroborated our U.S. survey conclusions. Applying World Health Organization census data as well as data from individual countries, we estimate there are 25-30 million women outside the U.S. that could be early adopters of Geneveve.
 
Current Treatments and Their Limitations
 
Currently, few clinically proven medical treatments are available to effectively treat vaginal laxity. The most widely prescribed treatments include Kegel exercises and invasive surgical procedures, known as laser vaginal rejuvenation (“LVR”) or vaginoplasty.

● | Kegel Exercises: Kegels are an exercise that was developed by Dr. Arnold Kegel designed to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor - the pubococcygeal (“PC”) muscles - to increase vaginal muscle tone, improve sexual response, and limit involuntary urine release due to stress urinary incontinence. These exercises are often prescribed following childbirth or during and after menopause. However, we are not aware of any validated evidence indicating that Kegels improve vaginal laxity or sexual function due to laxity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Surgical Procedures: Of the various alternatives for treating vaginal laxity, invasive surgical procedures, such as LVR, are the only modalities with any proven efficacy outcomes. Typically, they are performed by plastic surgeons with patients under general anesthesia. According to The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (“ISAPS”), approximately 114,135 LVR surgeries were performed world-wide in 2013. However, these invasive surgical procedures are expensive, costing thousands of dollars, and can involve weeks of post-surgical recovery time for the patient. They also carry the risk of scarring, which can lead to uncomfortable or painful intercourse, long-term or permanent loss of sensation, serious infection, tissue necrosis, hematomas (fluid collection under the tissue that may require removal), and adverse reactions to anesthesia.

The Viveve Solution
 
We believe that Geneveve provides a compelling, clinically proven, safe, non-invasive treatment for vaginal laxity and improvement of sexual function. Geneveve consists of three major components: the Viveve System™ (an RF, or radio frequency, generator housed in a table-top console), a reusable handpiece and a single-use treatment tip, as well as several other consumable accessories. Geneveve is typically performed in a medical office setting by, or under the supervision of, trained and qualified physicians, that may include obstetricians and gynecologists, plastic surgeons, dermatologists, general surgeons, urologists, urogynecologists or family practitioners.
 
Benefits of the Viveve Solution
 
Our solution provides a number of benefits for physicians and patients:
 

● | Non-Invasive, Non-Ablative Alternative to Surgery with No Identified Safety Issues. Geneveve has been used to treat over 200 clinical study patients and physicians have used Geneveve on more than 2,000 patients as of the date of this report. The procedure is non-invasive and offers an alternative to surgery at a much lower price with little or no downtime from the patient’s normal routine. It is also not a surgical procedure and does not damage either the mucosal or sub-mucosal tissue or require any form of anesthesia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Single Treatment. Geneveve is normally performed in a medical office setting as a single treatment that takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Our studies have shown that the clinical effect from our procedure occurs within one to three months and patients continue to report improvements over a period of six months following treatment. In addition, our studies have shown that Geneveve maintains its effect for at least 12 months, based upon currently available data from our clinical studies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Compelling Physician Economics. We believe that in an era of declining government and insurance reimbursement, many physicians are seeking to add effective and safe, self-pay procedures to their practices. Geneveve can be easily adapted into many physician practices and offers compelling per-procedure economics for the physician, despite requiring a small capital equipment purchase.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ease of Use. Geneveve offers an easy-to-use, straightforward user interface that allows a trained physician or nurse to perform the treatment in less than 30 minutes. Geneveve provides real-time feedback and the patient can be monitored during the treatment. The handpiece and single-use treatment tip are designed with a small profile for accurate placement during treatment, comfort and ease of use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology
 
Geneveve uses a patented method of delivering monopolar RF energy for heating tissue.
 

● | Monopolar Radiofrequency Energy. Monopolar RF delivery uses two electrodes, with one active electrode being held in the device handpiece by the physician or nurse and the second, a passive return electrode, typically attached to the patient’s upper leg. Monopolar delivery allows for precise administration of energy because the electrical current is concentrated where the active electrode touches the body and disperses quickly as it travels towards the return electrode. The monopolar RF process is distinct from bipolar RF-based technology, which is superficial, relying on current passing through tissue located between two probes placed close together on the surface of the skin. We believe that our monopolar technology delivers energy more effectively and to a greater tissue depth than bipolar technology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Capacitive Coupling Mechanism of Action for Collagen Heating. Our single-use Viveve treatment tip contains patented technology that uses monopolar RF energy as a controlled tissue heating source through the use of a non-conducting material, known as a dielectric. Capacitive coupling is the use of the dielectric to create an electric field in the area where the treatment tip touches the body. The electric field induces a current within the surrounding tissue, resulting in volumetric heating of the tissue due to the tissue’s natural resistance to electrical current flow. Collagen is an efficient conductor of electricity and therefore acts as a pathway for the electric current. This process results in heating of the fibrous septae, the strands of collagen fibers that permeate tissues and connect the outer mucosal layer to the underlying muscle. Delivery of heat to the fibrous septae located in deeper layers of the tissue shrinks and shortens them, resulting in tightening of the mucosal tissue. Over time, new collagen strands may grow as part of the body’s natural response to the activation of fibroblasts that results from the application of low-energy hyperthermic RF energy. These new strands may add strength and produce additional tissue tightening over the next one to three months. This tightening of the tissue has the potential to reduce vaginal laxity and increase sexual function.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geneveve
 
Geneveve includes three major components: the Viveve System™ (an RF, or radio frequency, generator housed in a table-top console), a reusable handpiece and a single-use treatment tip, as well as several other consumable accessories. Physicians or nurses attach the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece, which is connected to the console. The generator authenticates the treatment tip and programs the system for the desired treatment without further physician intervention.

● | Radiofrequency Generator. The generator produces a six-megahertz signal and is simple and efficient to operate. Controls are within easy reach, and important user information is clearly displayed on the console’s built-in display, including energy delivered, tissue impedance, duration and feedback on procedure technique. Cooling is achieved, in conjunction with the generator, though the delivery of a coolant that helps to cool and protect the mucosa during a procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Handpiece. The reusable handpiece holds the treatment tip in place and processes information about temperature, contact, cooling system function and other important data. A precision control valve within the handpiece meters the delivery of coolant, which protects the mucosal surface.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment Tip. The single-use treatment tip is available in one size and comes pre-sterilized. Each treatment tip contains a proprietary internal EPROM, or programmable memory chip, which stores treatment parameters and safety limits in order to optimize performance and safety. To enhance procedural safety, we have programmed the EPROM for single-use treatments. Using the same treatment tip to perform multiple procedures could result in injury, therefore, the EPROM disables the treatment tip after a pre-programmed number of pulses to ensure that the treatment tip is not reused.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Geneveve also includes other consumable components. The console houses a canister of coolant that can be used for approximately four to five procedures. Each procedure requires a new return pad, which is typically adhered to the patient’s upper leg to allow a path of travel for the RF current through the body and back to the generator. We also sell proprietary single-use bottles of coupling fluid, a viscous liquid that helps ensure electrical and thermal contact with the treatment tip.
 
Geneveve is conducted on an outpatient basis in a physician’s office. The procedure typically takes less than 30 minutes and does not require any form of anesthesia. To perform the procedure, a physician or nurse attaches the single-use treatment tip to the handpiece. As described above, the return pad is then adhered to the patient’s upper leg to allow a path of travel for the RF current back to the generator. Prior to treatment, the treatment area is bathed in coupling fluid, which is used for conduction and lubrication. The area from the 1:00 o’clock position to the 11:00 o’clock position just inside the hymenal ring is treated using the Viveve treatment tip by delivering a three-phased pulse: Phase 1 – cooling, Phase 2 – 90 Joules/cm2 of RF energy, and Phase 3 – cooling. Each pulse lasts approximately eight seconds. The Viveve treatment tip is then repositioned in an overlapping fashion clockwise and the three-phased treatment pulse is repeated. The entire circumferential treatment area from the 1:00 o’clock position to the 11:00 o’clock position is treated five times with overlapping pulses. Treatment of the urethral area is avoided. During the treatment procedure patients are expected to feel a sensation of warmth when the RF phase is delivered and a cooling sensation when the cooling phases are delivered. Based on our current clinical results, Geneveve is only required once, with efficacy lasting for at least 12 months.
 
Our Customers
 
To date, we have focused our initial commercial efforts in markets where we have received regulatory clearances for Geneveve, or in the case of Japan, where we use a physician import license pathway to sell our product. Within each market, we target thought leaders in the OB/GYN and plastic surgery specialties in order to increase awareness of vaginal laxity and accelerate patient acceptance of Geneveve. As our markets mature, we intend to target a broader number of physician specialties, including urogynecologists, dermatologists, urologists, general surgeons, and family practitioners.
 
Through our sales employees, and distributors, we currently target physicians who have a demonstrated commitment to building a high-volume, non-invasive, treatment business within their practice. As distribution of our product continues to expand globally, we intend to continue to utilize distribution partners in all countries except the U.S. and Canada where we have a direct sales force. To date, we are heavily reliant on our relationships with distribution partners for the sale of our products outside the U.S.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to become the leading provider of non-invasive solutions to treat vaginal laxity by:
 
Increasing the Installed Base of Geneveve. In our existing markets, we plan to expand the number of Geneveve users from our initial base of early adopters by leveraging our current and future clinical study results and through innovative marketing programs directed at both physicians and patients, where permitted by law. As a condition that has historically had no viable, non-invasive solutions, we intend to focus much of our marketing effort on physician and patient education. Further, we intend to expand the number of regulatory approvals both internationally and in the U.S., to further increase the areas in which we can market Geneveve.
 
Driving Increased Treatment Tip Usage. Unlike the capital equipment model of other businesses, we maintain an active, continuous relationship with our physician customer base because of the single-use, disposable nature of the treatment tips. We work collaboratively with our physician customer base to increase treatment tip usage by enhancing customer awareness and facilitating the marketing efforts of our physician customers to their patients. We believe that our customers’ interests are closely aligned with our interests, and we plan to monitor the market to foster continued procedure growth for our customers and treatment tip sales for us. We intend to launch innovative marketing programs with physician customers to develop a profitable Geneveve practice.

Broadening Our Physician Customer Base. While our initial focus is on marketing our procedure to the OB/GYN specialty, we intend to selectively expand our sales efforts into other physician specialties, such as plastic surgery, dermatology, urology, urogynecology, general surgery and family practice. Additionally, we intend to pursue sales from physician-directed medi-spas with track records of safe and successful aesthetic treatments.
 
Developing New Treatment Tips and System Enhancements. We intend to continue to expand our line of treatment tips to allow for even shorter procedure times to benefit both physicians and patients. We also plan to pursue potential system modifications and next generation enhancements that will further increase the ease-of-use of Geneveve.
 
Investing in Intellectual Property and Patent Protection. We will continue to invest in expanding our intellectual property portfolio, and we intend to file for additional patents to strengthen our intellectual property rights. Areas in which we may pursue additional patent protection include, but are not limited to, redesign of certain system components, disposable components and software algorithms. We believe that our intellectual property rights protect our position as the exclusive provider of a vaginal laxity treatment using monopolar RF technology in the U.S. and in many other countries. (See discussion under the heading “Patents and Proprietary Technology”.) 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
International
 
We currently market and sell Geneveve, including the single-use treatment tips, in 51 countries outside the U.S. through trained sales employees and distributors. As of the date of this report, we had four sales directors (Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Latin America), and 26 sales distributors covering 69 countries throughout the world.
 
By using a consultative sales process, we form strong relationships with our customers through frequent interactions. Beyond performing initial system installation and on-site training, which can occur within two weeks of a physician’s purchase decision, our sales consultants provide ongoing consultation to physicians on how to integrate Geneveve into their practices and market procedures to their patients.
 
We also provide comprehensive training and education to each physician upon delivery of Geneveve. We require this initial training to assist physicians in safely and effectively performing Geneveve treatment.
 
Our strategy to grow sales internationally is to:
 

● | increase penetration of Geneveve by targeting physicians and clinics that perform in-office procedures and by implementing direct-to-consumer marketing programs to increase patient awareness of Geneveve;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expand into new international markets by gaining regulatory approval, and identifying and training qualified distributors; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expand the scope of physicians who offer Geneveve in addition to OB/GYNs, including plastic surgeons, dermatologists, general surgeons, urologists, urogynecologists and primary care physicians.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Further, we intend to actively engage in promotional opportunities through participation in industry tradeshows, clinical workshops and company-sponsored conferences with expert panelists, as well as through trade journals, brochures and our website. We intend to actively seek opportunities to obtain positive media exposure, and plan to engage in direct-to-consumer marketing of Geneveve, including extensive use of social media.
 
United States
 
In December 2008, we received regulatory clearance from the FDA for a previous version of the device, no longer manufactured, for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis. In March 2015, we submitted a Special 510(k) to the FDA seeking clearance for the updated Viveve System to take into account the design modifications to the original 510(k) cleared device, which include improved user interface capabilities and enhanced manufacturability. In October 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to sell the updated device for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis.

We intend to seek regulatory clearance or approval from the FDA to allow us to begin to market Geneveve for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function, to physicians practicing in the U.S. and to build awareness of Geneveve in patients residing in the U.S. In September 2016, we submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application to FDA to begin a U.S. clinical study and the FDA has responded with additional questions regarding the proposed protocol and other aspects of the clinical study design, which we are working to address. If and when approval is received, we intend to begin our U.S. clinical study to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to treat vaginal laxity and/or improve sexual function. 
  
Clinical Studies

We have completed several pre-clinical studies, as well as three human clinical studies and we are currently preparing to conduct a fourth human clinical study within the U.S., if and when we receive approval of our IDE application from the FDA. While we believe the three completed studies have shown that Geneveve has a very strong safety profile and is highly effective in the treatment of vaginal laxity and improvement of sexual function, there is risk that the FDA will not agree with this assessment.
Pre-clinical Studies
 
In 2010, in collaboration with West Virginia University, we conducted an animal study in sheep to assess the safety, and further understand the mechanism of action, of Geneveve. The vaginal introitus of five parous sheep were treated once with Geneveve using a variety of energy levels (75−90 Joules/cm2). Each sheep then underwent serial vaginal biopsies immediately after treatment, at approximately one week, and at one, three and six months (4-5 samples per occurrence). Control biopsies were also obtained from three untreated parous sheep. We examined the vaginal mucosa and underlying connective tissue for thermal changes and subsequent tissue responses over a six month period through light microscopic examination of haematoxylin and eosin (“H&E”) stained slides that were reviewed by pathologists who were blinded as to the treated and untreated sheep.
 
The results of the study indicated that the optimal level of RF energy delivered was 90 J/cm2 and the biopsies supported the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of our technology involves connective tissue remodeling with fibroblast activation and new collagen production. Given the post-treatment absence of ulcerations, regional necrosis or diffuse fibrosis, throughout the six month follow-up period, we believe that FDA will eventually agree with our assessment regarding the safety profile of Geneveve.
 
As part of our clinical studies, we have studied and continue to study, the interaction of RF energy and tissue to further understand the mechanism of action of Geneveve. We have used transmission electron microscopy on ovine biopsied tissue samples to corroborate that our product induces subtle collagen modification and the deposition of new collagen that leads to tissue tightening and restoration of tissue elasticity. We have developed histology techniques to investigate the depth of heat in tissue, fibroblast activation and collagen deposition that we believe is responsible for long-term improvement and tightening of tissue. We have also created three-dimensional computer models to study tissue heating with our product. Determining the effectiveness of this type of treatment is inherently a subjective evaluation. When performing our clinical studies, we attempt to utilize the most compelling measures we can in order to provide convincing evidence of efficacy.
 
Clinical Studies
 
In 2008 and 2010, we conducted two single-arm (non-placebo controlled) human clinical studies using Geneveve, one in the U.S. and one in Japan, respectively. Both studies were designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Geneveve for the treatment of vaginal laxity and improvement of sexual function and were submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and Canada for the purpose of seeking regulatory clearance for the use and distribution of Geneveve in such locations. Each study resulted in patients reporting that Geneveve restored vaginal tightness to pre-childbirth level and improved sexual function. The results of our clinical trials are based on information reported by clinical patients in various response questionnaires (referred to as patient reported outcomes), designed to measure vaginal laxity and sexual function, completed by each clinical patient prior to treatment with respect to pre and post childbirth levels and at various times following treatment. All patient reported scores for each questionnaire and at each time point are compared to those scores reported by the same patients at baseline (prior to treatment) in order to assess whether patients have experienced a change due to the treatment. This change in score is then tested for statistical relevance (i.e. whether or not the change measured is due to chance). It is widely accepted by clinical trial industry standards that if the probability is less than 5% (p< .05) that this change is due to chance, than the results are deemed to be “Statistically Significant”. In other words, there is a 95% probability that the change in score measured is due to the treatment. Therefore, when we indicate that our clinical patients experienced a Statistically Significant result, we are referring to the change in responses as reported by such patients on the response questionnaires from the pre-treatment assessment (baseline) as compared to the post-treatment assessments at the various time points specified.

United States
 
We conducted our first human study of Geneveve beginning in November 2008. The study was a single-arm study (without a control group) conducted in 24 female subjects, ages 25-44 years old, each of whom had experienced at least one full-term vaginal delivery. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure at three RF dosing levels. Each woman was treated once with Geneveve, with no anesthesia – three patients received 60 joules/cm2, three patients received 75 joules/cm2, and 18 patients received 90 joules/cm2. Patient outcomes were measured at baseline, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months using several validated patient-reported outcome measures, including a company-designed vaginal laxity/tightness questionnaire (“VSQ”), Female Sexual Function Index (“FSFI”), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (“FSDS-R”) and the Global Response Assessment.
 
Within one month after treatment with Geneveve, patients reported a Statistically Significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores to pre-childbirth levels. These results continued throughout the 12 month follow-up period. Additionally, patients reported a Statistically Significant decrease at one month, and thereafter, in their personal distress scores from sexual activity. 
 
Geneveve also demonstrated a strong safety profile throughout the study. The treatment was well tolerated and there were no procedure-related adverse events or serious adverse events through the 12 month follow-up period. Notwithstanding the safety in trials to date of Geneveve, patients may experience undesirable side effects such as temporary swelling or reddening of the treated tissue. 
 
Japan
 
Our second human clinical study of Geneveve began in March 2010. This study was an open-label study conducted in 30 female subjects, ages 21-55 years old, each of whom had experienced at least one full-term vaginal delivery. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Each woman was treated once with Geneveve, with no anesthesia, using 90 joules/cm2 of RF energy as the therapeutic dose.
 
Patient reported outcomes were measured at baseline, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months using several validated patient-reported outcome measures, including VSQ, FSFI, FSDS-R and the Global Response Assessment.
 
Within one month after Geneveve, patients reported a Statistically Significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores, sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores to pre-childbirth levels. These results continued throughout the 12 month follow-up period. Additionally, patients reported a Statistically Significant decrease at one month, and thereafter, in their personal distress scores from sexual activity.
 
Geneveve continued to demonstrate a strong safety profile. The treatment was well tolerated and there were no procedure-related adverse events or serious adverse events through the 12 month follow-up period.
 
VIVEVE I Clinical Study
 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we began the VIVEVE I clinical study (VIveve Treatment of the Vaginal Introitus to EValuate Effectiveness), sometimes referred to in this report as the “OUS Clinical Trial,” a randomized, blinded and sham-controlled trial designed to further demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Geneveve versus a sham-control procedure for the treatment of vaginal laxity. The study was designed to demonstrate that Geneveve was superior to the sham treatment for the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints described below. Nine clinical sites in four countries (Canada, Italy, Spain and Japan) enrolled 174 patients, which included pre-menopausal females 18 years of age or older who experienced at least one full term vaginal delivery at least 12 months prior to enrollment date, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either an active treatment group or sham-control group. Patients were followed for six months post-treatment to assess the primary effectiveness and safety endpoints of the study with data being collected at one, three and six month intervals. The study also included a prospective interim data analysis at the 3 month endpoint of 50% of the patients enrolled. Patients randomized to the sham arm were offered the opportunity to receive Geneveve once they had completed the 6-month evaluation following the sham intervention.

The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of subjects in the active arm as compared to the proportion of subjects in the sham arm reporting no vaginal laxity at six months post-intervention. “No vaginal laxity” is operationally defined as a score > 4 on the VSQ, a patient reported global assessment of vaginal laxity based on a 7 point scale. Additionally, the primary safety endpoint was the proportion of subjects in the active arm experiencing an adverse event (“AE”) by six months post-treatment as compared to the proportion of the subjects in the sham arm experiencing an AE by six months post-intervention. Secondary endpoints included the adjusted change in mean score on the FSFI, FSDS-R and the Vaginal Laxity Inventory (“VALI”). The VALI was created specifically for the assessment of vaginal laxity by external medical experts. Its use as a comprehensive patient reported outcome questionnaire is currently being scientifically validated by us to assess women’s vaginal laxity on a 7 point scale.
 
In April 2016, we completed the VIVEVE I study and reported the following results:
 
At 6 months (n=155), the proportion of patients reporting “no vaginal laxity” in the active arm, as measured by the VSQ, was 41.7%, while the proportion of patients reporting “no vaginal laxity” in the sham arm on the VSQ was 19.2% (p=0.005). Moreover, the likelihood of having “no vaginal laxity” following treatment in the active arm was more than three times greater than for the sham arm (p=0.006). Further, nearly 80% of the subjects in the active arm experienced a positive change in VSQ score versus baseline.
 
At 6 months, for those patients who scored less than a 26.5 total score on the FSFI at baseline (n=103), the adjusted mean change from baseline score between the active arm and the sham arm was 3.2 (p=0.009). Moreover, for each of the six individual domains of the FSFI, subjects in the active group reported a greater increase in score than in the sham group. Change in scores from baseline for both the sexual arousal and orgasm domains were Statistically Significant and nearly 93% of subjects in the active arm experienced an increase in score versus baseline.
 
At 6 months, FSDS-R and VALI were also assessed as part of the secondary end-point analysis. While subjects in the active arm reported a greater increase in scores than the sham arm, the results for the FSDS-R and VALI were not Statistically Significant.
 
Safety for the study was assessed on the entire study population (n=174). Subjects reported the same level of unrelated (32.5% active versus 35.1% sham), related (11.1% active versus 12.3% sham) and serious (0.0% active versus 1.8% sham) adverse events in both the active and sham arm, further demonstrating that Geneveve is well tolerated with no safety concerns.
 
We believe that the consistency of results across these three clinical study populations, is indicative of the cross-cultural similarities in this medical condition and the positive impact that an effective non-invasive treatment can have on the sexual health of women after vaginal childbirth.
  
Research and Development
 
We intend to focus on various research and development efforts for Geneveve, including but not limited to:
  

● | conduct of the VIVEVE II study that is the subject of the pending IDE with FDA, in order to support a marketing application for a vaginal laxity/sexual function indication in the U.S.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | expansion of the number of approved indications in the U.S. and internationally, including but not limited to; postmenopausal vaginal atrophy and stress urinary incontinence; 
● | implementing a cost improvement program to further increase gross margins and gross profit opportunity; 

 
 
11




● | developing a new cooling system to maintain compliance with potential changes in environmental regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | designing new treatment tips to further optimize ease-of-use and reduce procedure times for patients and physicians; and
● | increasing security to prevent counterfeiting and refurbishment. 

  
We have formed strategic relationships with outside contractors for assistance on research and development projects, and we work closely with experts in the medical community to supplement our research and development resources. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $8,365,000 and $4,988,000, respectively. In the future, we expect to pursue further research and development initiatives to improve and extend our technological capabilities and to foster an environment of innovation and quality. 
 
Manufacturing
 
Our manufacturing strategy involves the combined utilization of internal manufacturing resources and expertise, as well as approved suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our internal manufacturing activities include the testing and packaging of Viveve treatment tips and handpieces, as well as the final integration, system testing and packaging of Geneveve. We outsource the manufacture of components, subassemblies and certain finished products that are produced to our specifications and shipped to our Sunnyvale facility for final assembly or inspection, testing and certification. Our finished products are stored at and distributed from our Sunnyvale facility. Quality control, risk management, efficiency and the ability to respond quickly to changing requirements are the primary goals of our manufacturing operations.
 
We have arrangements with our suppliers that allow us to adjust the delivery quantities of components, subassemblies and finished products, as well as delivery schedules, to match our changing requirements. The forecasts we use are based on historical trends, current utilization patterns and sales forecasts of future demand. Lead times for components, subassemblies and finished products may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. Most of our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, the components used in our devices.
 
We obtain programmable memory chips for our treatment tips and the coolant valve for the handpiece from single suppliers, for which we attempt to mitigate risks through inventory management and utilization of 12- to 18-month purchase orders, and sterilization services from a single vendor, for which we attempt to mitigate risks by using two sterilization chambers at each of two locations. Other products and components come from single suppliers, but alternate suppliers have been qualified or, we believe, can be readily identified and qualified. In addition, the availability of cryogen for our cooling module, which we can source from multiple suppliers, may fluctuate due to changes in the global supply of this material. To date, shipments of finished products to our customers have not been delayed due to material delays in obtaining any of our components, subassemblies or finished products.
 
We are required to manufacture our product in compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 820 (“21 CFR 820”) enacted by the FDA (known as the Quality System Regulation or QSR). 21 CFR 820 regulates the methods and documentation relating to the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our product. We maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our product in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union. These certifications include EN ISO 9001:2000 and CAN/CSA ISO 13485:2003. We are also required to maintain our product registration in a number of other foreign markets such as Canada.

We use small quantities of common cleaning products in our manufacturing operations, which are lawfully disposed of through a routine waste management program. Except for costs that may be incurred in the future in connection with environmental regulations requiring the phase out of R134a, a hydrofluorocarbon, or HFC, upon which our cooling module relies, we do not anticipate any material costs due to compliance with environmental laws or regulations. In 2007, the European Union enacted directives aimed at the automotive industry for the removal of HFC's from air conditioning. As a result of these directives, we anticipate that similar directives may be imposed on the medical device industry over the next decade. While we do not anticipate that we will have to incur costs in the near future to develop an alternative cooling module for our device which is not dependent on HFCs, if and when we are required to do so, and if we do not do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, Geneveve may not be in compliance with environmental regulations, which could result in fines, civil penalties and the inability to sell our products in certain major international markets.
 
Given our limited commercial history, we only offer a one year warranty providing for the repair, rework or replacement (at the Company’s option) of products that fail to perform within stated specifications. To the extent that any of our components have performance related or technical issues in the field, we typically replace those components as necessary.
 
Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
We rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and Geneveve. We have an exclusive license to or own 4 issued U.S. patents directed to our technology and Geneveve Additionally, we have 3 pending U.S. patent applications, 49 issued foreign patents, and 20 pending foreign patent applications, some of which foreign applications preserve an opportunity to pursue patent rights in multiple countries. 

U.S. Patent | Foreign Patents | 
------------+-----------------+-------
Issued | Pending | Issued | Pending
4 | 3 | 49 | 20 

 
All of our employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. We cannot provide any assurance that our employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or invention assignment terms of their agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our product or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 
“Viveve,” is a registered trademark in the U.S. and several foreign countries. Geneveve is a registered trademark in the European Community and South Korea; there are pending applications in the U.S. as well as 4 foreign countries. As of the date of this report, we have one registered trademark in the U.S., as well as various foreign registrations protecting the mark in 19 countries outside of the U.S. We may file for additional trademarks to strengthen our trademark rights, but we cannot be certain that our trademark applications will issue or that our trademarks will be enforceable.
 
Edward Knowlton Licensed Patents
 
On February 10, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment and License Agreement with Edward W. Knowlton (“Knowlton”), as amended on May 22, 2006 and July 20, 2007 (collectively, the “Knowlton IP Agreement”), pursuant to which Knowlton granted to Viveve, Inc. an exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual worldwide sublicense to certain intellectual property and technology licensed to Knowlton from a third party, including rights to several patents and patent applications owned by Thermage, Inc. outside the field of contraction, remodeling and ablation of the skin through and including (but not beyond) the subcutaneous fat layer below the skin (collectively, the “Knowlton Licensed IP”). The sublicense under the Knowlton Licensed IP is fully-paid, transferable, sublicensable and permits us to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any product or technology solely for use in the field of transmucosal treatment of the vagina or vulva (the “Field”) and to practice any process, method, or procedure solely in the Field. The Knowlton IP Agreement also assigns to us all technology and related intellectual property rights owned by Knowlton for the development and commercialization of devices, including any improvements, in the Field (the “Knowlton Assigned IP”). We are obligated to file and reasonably prosecute any patent applications that include a description of the Knowlton Assigned IP as prior art and maintain all patents included in the Knowlton Assigned IP, at our expense. In consideration of the sale, assignment, transfer, release and conveyance and other obligations of Knowlton under the Knowlton IP Agreement, Viveve, Inc. issued 200,000 shares of our common stock to Knowlton and agreed to engage the consulting services of Knowlton.

      Also on February 10, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Consulting Agreement with Knowlton (“Knowlton Consulting Agreement”), pursuant to which Knowlton assigned all rights to any inventions and intellectual property developed during the course of providing consulting services in the Field during the term of the agreement. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions described therein, the term of the Knowlton Consulting Agreement continued until the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is six months after the closing of an initial public offering of Viveve, Inc.’s stock; or (ii) the acquisition by a third party of all or substantially all of the business or assets of Viveve, Inc., whether by asset or stock acquisition, merger, consolidation or otherwise. The agreement could be renewed only upon the mutual written agreement of the parties prior to its expiration. The Knowlton Consulting Agreement expired by its terms on September 23, 2014, the effective date of the Merger. The assignment of the intellectual property developed during the term of the Knowlton Consulting Agreement survives termination. 
 
Agreement with Solta Medical
 
Effective April 30, 2010, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Solta Medical, Inc. (“Solta”), pursuant to which Solta agreed to sell to Viveve, Inc. the cryogen cooling method and coupling fluid that Solta uses with its ThermaCool® System (“TC3 System”) for use with our compatible radio frequency medical device for the purpose of conducting our initial clinical trials. The applicable term of the Supply Agreement is the later of the period through completion of our initial clinical trials or six months following the effective date. On October 14, 2010, the parties amended the term of the Supply Agreement to remain in effect for so long as Solta supports its TC3 System. In the event that Solta discontinues support of its TC3 System and terminates the Supply Agreement, Solta agrees to (i) provide us with information for Solta’s cryogen supplier, (ii) permit us to make any arrangement with such supplier for a continued supply of cryogen and (iii) grant us a royalty free, non-exclusive perpetual license under any Solta intellectual property directed to the design of the cryogen container in the field of treating vaginal tissue.
 
The portion of the Supply Agreement relating to coupling fluid was subsequently superseded by the parties’ Coupling Fluid License and Product Supply Agreement on September 30, 2010, pursuant to which Solta agreed to (i) grant to Viveve, Inc. a license for the coupling fluid and (ii) supply the coupling fluid at preferred pricing for two years and at non-preferred pricing after two years. The agreement grants to us a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, perpetual, exclusive license in the field of treating vaginal tissue, with a right to grant sublicenses in such field, to make, have made, use and sell coupling fluid for an aggregate license fee of $125,000. The agreement was for an initial term of three years, after which it continues to remain in effect unless and until terminated in accordance with the terms therein. In addition, while the terms of the original agreement permit the use of the cryogen cooling method for initial clinical trials, Viveve also purchases the cryogen cooling method and coupling fluid from Solta for commercial purposes.  We currently do not have an alternative source of cryogen and if Solta refuses to sell to us for commercial reasons, or otherwise, our business could be materially adversely affected.
 
Agreement with Stellartech Research Corporation
 
On June 12, 2006, Viveve, Inc. entered into the Stellartech Agreement, as amended and restated on October 4, 2007, with Stellartech for an initial term of three years in connection with the performance of development and manufacturing services by Stellartech and the license of certain technology and intellectual property rights to each party. Under the Stellartech Agreement, we agreed to purchase 300 units of generators manufactured by Stellartech. In conjunction with the Agreement, Stellartech purchased 37,500 shares of Viveve, Inc.’s common stock at $0.008. Under the Stellartech Agreement, we paid Stellartech $6,485,000 and $3,446,000 for goods and services during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, Stellartech granted to us a non-exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license in the Field (defined above in the discussions titled “Edward Knowlton Licensed Patents”) to use Stellartech’s technology incorporated into deliverables or products developed, manufactured or sold by Stellartech to us pursuant to the Stellartech Agreement (the “Stellartech Products”) to use, sell, offer for sale, import and distribute the Stellartech Products within the Field, including the use of software object code incorporated into the Stellartech Products. The Stellartech technology consists of know-how applicable to the manufacturing and repair of Geneveve, including any other intellectual property which Stellartech developed or acquired separate and apart from the Stellartech Agreement and all related derivative works. In addition, once we purchase a minimum commitment of 300 units of the RF generator component (the “Minimum Commitment”) and the Stellartech Agreement expires, Stellartech is to grant us a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license to use the Stellartech technology incorporated into the Stellartech Products to make and have made Stellartech Products in the Field.
 
 
14



Stellartech also granted (i) an exclusive (even as to Stellartech), nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free license within the Field under those certain intellectual property rights licensed to Stellartech pursuant to a development and supply agreement between Stellartech and Thermage, dated October 1, 1997 (the “Thermage Technology”), to use any elements of the Thermage Technology incorporated into the Stellartech Products, solely for the use, sale, offer for sale, importation and distribution within the Field; (ii) upon our satisfaction of the Minimum Commitment and the expiration of the Stellartech Agreement, an exclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license within the Field under Stellartech’s license rights in the Thermage Technology to use any elements of the Thermage Technology which are incorporated into the Stellartech Products to make and have made Stellartech Products in the Field; and (iii) the exclusive right within the Field to prosecute infringers of the portion of Stellartech’s Thermage Technology rights exclusively licensed to us. Our license rights in Thermage Technology also include the use of software object code for Thermage Technology used in the Stellartech Products. As of the date of this report, the Stellartech Agreement has expired by its terms, however, the parties still continue to operate under the terms of the agreement. In addition, we have not yet met the Minimum Commitment requirement, and therefore we are not permitted to use the Stellartech technology with any other manufacturer. If Stellartech refuses or is unable to meet our delivery requirements for Geneveve, our business could be materially adversely affected.
 
In March 2012, Viveve, Inc. entered into a Quality and Regulatory Agreement with Stellartech, pursuant to which the parties clarified their respective quality and regulatory responsibilities under the Stellartech Agreement. The Quality and Regulatory Agreement provides that we will serve as the legal manufacturer for all Stellartech Products developed and sold to us thereunder and that we are obligated to maintain all relevant quality assurance and regulatory processes and requirements required by any regulatory authority and to comply with the processes and requirements set forth in the schedule of responsibilities provided in the agreement.
 
Government Regulation
 
Geneveve is a medical device subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by international regulatory bodies as well as the FDA. These regulations govern the following activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products exported internationally or distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses:

● | product design, development and manufacture;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


● | product marketing, sales and distribution; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the regulatory approvals already received in connection with the sale of Geneveve in the foreign jurisdictions described below and the approvals/clearances being sought in the U.S., we are currently seeking regulatory approval or clearance for the sale of our product in many other countries around the world. 
 
International
 
Sales of our product outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In addition, exports of medical devices from the U.S. are regulated by the FDA. Complying with international regulatory requirements can be an expensive and time-consuming process and approval is not certain. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals, as required by other countries, may be longer than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for such registrations or approvals may significantly differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain or maintain registrations or approvals in other countries. We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals. If we experience delays in receiving necessary registrations or approvals to market our product outside the U.S., or if we fail to receive those registrations or approvals, we may be unable to market our product or enhancements in international markets effectively, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth strategy.

An entity that seeks to export an unapproved Class III medical device from the U.S. to a “non-Tier I” country is required to obtain export approval from the FDA. The Tier I countries are largely defined as industrialized countries with established regulatory infrastructure, such as, among others, Canada and the European Union. In January of 2011, we sought to obtain FDA approval to export Geneveve to Mexico, Brazil and Korea (all non-Tier I countries). An export approval was obtained on March 7, 2011. Exportation of an unapproved Class III medical device to a Tier I country is permitted without FDA approval provided that certain conditions are met. Accordingly, we have exported Geneveve to Canada and the European Union without FDA approval in accordance with Section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act).
 
Once an entity has obtained a marketing authorization for the product in a Tier I country (e.g., a CE mark, etc.), the device can then be shipped from the U.S. to any country in the world without FDA approval. On December 7, 2010, we obtained a CE Mark for Geneveve. As a result, we may now legally export Geneveve to non-Tier I countries, such as China and Hong Kong without FDA approval.
 
Entities legally exporting products from the U.S. are often asked by foreign customers or foreign governments to supply an export certificate issued by the FDA to accompany a device. An export certificate is a document prepared by the FDA containing information about a product’s regulatory or marketing status in the U.S. Although we have requested the issuance of export certificates to allow exports into many countries around the world, the FDA has not yet issued export certificates to us. 
 
Currently, Geneveve is cleared for marketing in 51 countries throughout the world under the following indications for use: 
 

Indication for Use: | No. of Countries: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------
General surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis | 3 (including the U.S.)
For treatment of vaginal laxity | 34 
For treatment of the vaginal introitus, after vaginal childbirth, to improve sexual function | 13 
For vaginal rejuvenation | 1 

 
Outside the U.S., we market and sell through an extensive network of distribution partners. In the U.S., Geneveve is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis and we market and sell through a direct sales force. 
 
United States
 
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, any medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. The classification system is risk based, with devices deemed to pose the lowest risk being Class I, and devices posing the most risk being Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from the requirement to obtain FDA premarket clearance or approval. For most Class II devices (and a small number of Class I devices), a company must submit to the FDA a premarket notification (known as 510(k) submission) requesting clearance to commercially distribute the device. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring FDA premarket approval via a Premarket Approval (“PMA”) application. The FDA has issued regulations identifying the Class into which different types of devices fall and identifying whether the device type is exempt from the 510(k) process or if a 510(k) is needed.
 
 
16



510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared and legally marketed device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs (known as a predicate device). The FDA strives to make a determination that the device is substantially equivalent (SE) (i.e., clear the device) or not substantially equivalent (NSE) within 90 days of submission of the notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the FDA will issue an NSE letter and place the device into Class III.
 
Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, or any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, requires a new 510(k) clearance and may even, in some circumstances, require a PMA, if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues or the product has a new intended use. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. If the FDA were to disagree with a manufacturer’s determination that changes did not require a new 510(k), the FDA could require the manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained and the manufacturer could be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 
In December 2008, a predecessor company to Viveve received 510(k) clearance for a previous version of the Geneveve device. Since then, we have made design modifications to the original 510(k)-cleared device. In March 2015, we submitted a Special 510(k) to the FDA seeking clearance for the updated Viveve System to take into account the design modifications to the original 510(k)-cleared device, which included improved user interface capabilities and enhanced manufacturability. In October 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to sell the updated device for use in general surgical procedures for electrocoagulation and hemostasis.
 
De Novo Process
 
If FDA has not issued a regulation classifying a particular type of device as Class I, and if there is no known predicate for a device (i.e., a legally-marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval with comparable indications for use and technological characteristics), the device is automatically Class III, regardless of the risk the device poses. If a device is automatically/statutorily classified into Class III in this manner, a company can petition FDA to reclassify the category of devices into Class II or Class I via a process known as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” which is typically referred to as the “de novo process.” The direct de novo process allows a company to request that a new product classification be established without the company first submitting a 510(k) notification for the device. . The reclassification petition should include a risk-benefit analysis demonstrating that, when subject to general controls or general and special controls, the probable benefits to health from use of the device outweigh any probable injury or illness from such use. The submitter also must describe why general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and for proposed Class II devices, provide proposed special controls. If a product is classified as Class II through the direct de novo review process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) premarket notifications, including by competitors. 
 
We intend to seek FDA authorization to market Geneveve for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function by utilizing the direct de novo process. However, we cannot predict when or if approval of such a petition will be obtained. In addition, if FDA fails to grant a de novo petition, we will be required to seek FDA premarket approval (via the more stringent PMA process) for Geneveve. Delays in receipt of FDA clearance or failure to receive FDA clearance or approval could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects.

Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support an FDA de novo reclassification, and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. With respect to Geneveve, the FDA has asked us to conduct a clinical study under an IDE, to support a future product submission. In the U.S., clinical trials on medical devices generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA if the device is a “significant risk” device. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by both the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical trial sites. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB at the relevant clinical trial sites and in accordance with FDA regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the patients’ informed consent, in compliance with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy regulations. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product. Similarly, in Europe and other regions, clinical study protocols must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country.
 
In June 2012, we submitted a pre-IDE application and requested an in-person meeting with the FDA to solicit feedback in advance of filing an IDE to conduct a clinical study of Geneveve to support regulatory submission. In August 2012, we met with the FDA and received feedback on our pre-clinical data, historical clinical data, and a clinical protocol for a prospective randomized controlled trial. We had a second meeting with the FDA on December 17, 2015 and received additional feedback on our clinical protocol design and indication for use. In September 2016 we submitted an IDE application to FDA to begin a U.S. clinical study and the FDA has responded with additional questions regarding the proposed protocol and other aspects of the clinical study design, which we are working to address. If and when approval is received, we intend to begin our U.S. clinical study to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device to treat vaginal laxity and/or improve sexual function.  
 
Continuing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality system regulations (“QSRs”), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses to both physician and consumers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”), regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls and notices of corrections or removals; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any other postmarket requirements that FDA might impose as part of the device approval or clearance process.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state equivalents such as the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”), to determine compliance with the QSR and other regulations. In the past, our facility has been inspected, and observations were noted, including an April 2012 CDHS inspection that cited deficiencies related to signature authority of inspection documentation, incomplete corrective action responses, and labeling indicating that our product contained no latex without proper objective evidence. The FDA and CDHS have accepted our responses to these observations, and we believe that we and our third-party manufacturer are in substantial compliance with the QSR.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following actions:
 

● | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
18




● | repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing to grant export approval for our product;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 
If any of these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We are also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to the environment, health and safety, land use, advertising, and quality assurance. We believe that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
 
Competition
 
The medical device industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. While we believe that our solution to treat vaginal laxity is unique and offers a more effective solution from that which is on the market currently, we also believe that the market for the treatment of vaginal laxity and women’s sexual function remains a tremendous, under-developed opportunity. Therefore, competition is expected to increase, particularly as the market becomes more developed with further solutions. Aside from Kegel exercises and invasive surgical procedures, such as LVR, there are many companies developing or that have developed energy-based technologies for vaginal rejuvenation as well as others developing drug therapies and therapeutics for the treatment of various types of female sexual dysfunction. Further, the overall size and attractiveness of the market may compel larger companies focused in the OB/GYN, aesthetic or women’s health markets, and with much greater capital and other resources, to pursue development of or acquire technologies that may address these areas. Potential competitors include, but are not limited to Cynosure, Syneron Medical, Fotona, Thermi Aesthetics (acquired by Almirall, S.A.), Cutera, Apricus, and others, some of whom have more established products and customer relationships than we have.
Employees
 
As of February 8, 2017, we had 42 full-time employees and we retain the services of several qualified consultants. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Continuance into Delaware
 
On July 22, 2015, at our 2015 Annual and Special Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved a special resolution authorizing a continuance of the Company (the “Continuance”) into the State of Delaware under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and the adoption of charter documents that comply with the DGCL in connection therewith, effective as of a date to be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, no more than 12 months from the date of the meeting. On May 9, 2016, the Company filed the necessary Application for Authorization to Continue into Another Jurisdiction and Statutory Declaration with the Yukon registrar. On May 10, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion and Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to move its domicile from the Yukon Territory to Delaware.
 
The Continuance did not involve any change in our business, properties, corporate headquarters or management. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Continuance continued to serve as our officers following the Continuance, and the current members of the Board of Directors continued to serve as the members of the Board following the Continuance. There was no change in our operations, assets, liabilities or obligations as a result of the Continuance. Other than the approval of our stockholders and the filings with the Yukon Registrar of Corporations and the Secretary of State of Delaware, there were no federal or state regulatory requirements that we were required to comply with or approvals that we were required to obtain in connection with the Continuance.

Upon the effectiveness of the Continuance, each outstanding share of our common stock continued to be an outstanding share of our common stock as incorporated in Delaware and each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of our common stock continued to be an option, right or warrant to acquire an equal number of shares of common stock under the same terms and conditions. Upon effectiveness of the Continuance, we were governed by the Certificate of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware and by bylaws prepared in accordance with the DGCL, which were approved by our stockholders at the 2015 Annual and Special Meeting. Following the Continuance, we were governed by the DGCL instead of the Yukon Business Corporation Act.
