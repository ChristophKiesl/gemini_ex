ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History 
 
On January 3, 2020, we (the “Company”, “Loop Media”, “Issuer”, “we”, “us”, “our”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Loop Media Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), and Loop Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Predecessor Loop”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, on February 6, 2020, Merger Sub merged with and into Predecessor Loop with Predecessor Loop surviving the merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). At the time of the Merger, Predecessor Loop stockholders received one newly issued share of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of Predecessor Loop common stock.
 
The Merger was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition of the Company for financial accounting purposes. Predecessor Loop is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the Company’s historical financial statements before the Merger have been replaced with the historical financial statements of Predecessor Loop before the Merger in our filings with the SEC since the Merger.
 
Prior to the Merger our business comprised two main business segments: (i) travel agency assistance services and (ii) convention services. Upon completion of the Merger, on February 6, 2020, the Company sold these businesses and related assets to a stockholder of the Company in exchange for 2,000,000 outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.
 
On May 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Plan of Merger by and among the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Predecessor Loop, pursuant to which, Predecessor Loop merged with and into the Company with the Company surviving the merger and the separate existence of Predecessor Loop ceasing (the “Consolidation”). To affect the Consolidation, the Certificate of Ownership and Merger were filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on June 8, 2020 and the Articles of Merger were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on June 9, 2020. In connection with the Consolidation the Company changed its name to Loop Media, Inc. and remained a Nevada corporation.
 
On June 8, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Change pursuant to NRS 78.209 with the Nevada Secretary of State to implement the reverse split of the Company’s authorized and outstanding shares of common stock on a 1 to 1.5 basis (the “Reverse Split”). In connection with the Reverse Split, the number of shares of common stock the Company has the authority to issue decreased from 500,000,000 to 333,333,334 shares, and there was a corresponding decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares of each class and series of common stock. Except for de minimus adjustments that resulted from the treatment of fractional shares, the Reverse Split did not have any dilutive effect on our then current stockholders at the time of the Reverse Split because each stockholder held the same percentage of our common stock outstanding immediately following the Reverse Split as such stockholder held immediately prior to the Reverse Split. As a result of the Reverse Split, the number of shares of our common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of warrants, options, or other securities outstanding at the time of the Reverse Split and convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of our common stock, and the exercise or conversion prices for these securities, have also been ratably adjusted in accordance with their terms. All share and per share numbers in this report relating to our common stock prior to the Reverse Stock Split have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Split, unless otherwise stated.
 
The Company
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on May 11, 2015. Our historical business comprised two main business segments: (i) travel agency assistance services and (ii) convention services, which business was sold upon consummation of the Merger with Predecessor Loop. As a result of the Merger with Predecessor Loop, on February 6, 2020, we became an early-stage media company and acquired Predecessor Loop’s video streaming business and the management team of Predecessor Loop became our management team.
 
Predecessor Loop was started in 2016 with the intention of developing and then delivering a streaming video music service to consumers on their in-home and mobile devices. In 2016, Predecessor Loop sought to acquire ScreenPlay, Inc., a Washington corporation (“ScreenPlay”), which operated a business-focused video streaming service providing music video and other content to business venues and which had a vast short-form video content library that contained over 500,000 videos, including music videos, game, and TV trailers. At that time, Predecessor Loop acquired 20% of the remaining outstanding shares of ScreenPlay and entered into an agreement to acquire all of the remaining outstanding shares.
 
Predecessor Loop sought to acquire ScreenPlay to obtain access to and ownership of ScreenPlay’s vast video content, which could then be streamed to Predecessor Loop’s target retail customers, and to benefit from ScreenPlay’s relationships with the major music label companies whose licenses would be required to provide music video content to such retail customers. The acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of ScreenPlay by Predecessor Loop was consummated in 2019, at which time ScreenPlay’s content became the foundation of Predecessor Loop’s (and now our) business. Since the acquisition of ScreenPlay, we have continued to procure additional content, through acquisitions and licenses, to further grow our video library.

Our Business
 
Loop Media is at the forefront of curating short-form video content into dynamic and engaging visual experiences, which we deliver to business customers for their out of home (“OOH”) venues and directly to retail consumers (“D2C”) in their home and on their mobile devices. Our curated video content, which is currently primarily music videos, is provided to business venues and consumers on either a paid subscription (“Premium Service”) or unpaid advertising (“Ad-Supported Service”, and together with the Premium Service, the “Service”) basis. We are actively developing our non-music video content and expect to expand this area of our service to help further diversify our video offerings. We seek to monetize our content through the provision of our Services primarily in the United States. Our revenue is generated by advertisers who pay to have their advertisements viewed by the end users of our services and by business owners and users who pay a subscription fee to access our services without advertisements.
 
We are an early-stage operating company, with limited revenue and negative cash flow from operations. Our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, consists almost entirely of revenue from our historic ScreenPlay business, which we acquired along with ScreenPlay’s catalogue of music and other videos in February 2020 and does not yet fully reflect expected revenues from our more recent product offerings, Services, and business model. See “Business Model.”
 
The Company employed approximately 43 people as of December 31, 2020, 34 of whom were full-time employees and 9 of whom were contract workers.
 
We have made significant investment and incurred a large amount of fees and expenses, including some non-cash items, in order to develop our business and will need to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We rely on external funding to finance our business and will continue to do so. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our revenues were $2,794,081 and $3,381,121, respectively. We had a net loss in both years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company has an accumulated deficit. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and/or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Our Services
 
We provide curated short-form video content to business customers for their OOH venues and D2C customers in their home and on their mobile devices.
 
Loop Media’s music video service provides a unique three-hundred-and-sixty-degree experience that allows a user to access our product in their home on a connected television (CTV) or mobile device, while they travel outside their home on their mobile device, and upon arriving at an OOH venue that offers our Services. While at home or in the OOH venue a consumer may also be able to use our mobile application (Loop – Live Music Videos) (the “Loop App”) to interact with their home CTV or the venue’s televisions, as our mobile application includes social features that allow users to follow and be followed by other users, share their location and any user created playlist (a video music “Loop”), view activity, signal support for a particular music video, and listen to other users’ Loops. We believe we are the only service licensed by all three major music labels (see “License Agreements”) providing users with access to a music video product in both OOH venues and directly to their CTVs and mobile devices.
 
An upcoming feature is expected to allow us to engage customers while they are at an OOH venue that has our service through social media applications and on-screen identification. We will encourage the customer to download the Loop App which allows them the opportunity to influence what is playing on select screens while in the venue (at the venue’s discretion). Using the D2C application the user is expected to be able to access a large variety of playlists in the free advertising supported version of the application. Premium Service subscribers will be able to access even more content and features in the paid version of our application.
 
With the introduction of our D2C service we have begun to take the programing and music video management experience we have developed in our OOH service to the under-serviced consumer market. Although there are other avenues to watch individual music videos on-line, we believe there is a shortage of professionally produced music video programs available. In addition to being able to play individual music videos, users of our premium version will also be able to program their own playlists in expanded ways. We expect our advertising-enabled free video service will be welcomed by consumers as it will bring dozens of professionally produced video programs to the market at no direct cost to the viewer.

Our Operations
 
We acquire short-form video content and produce, curate, develop and package that content for distribution to our customers. Customers can access our content primarily by visiting select OOH venues, through over the top (“OTT”) linear channels on CTVs and similar devices and on their mobile devices through our Loop App.
 
Content acquisition
 
We acquire video content through acquisition, obtaining licensing rights and partnering with owners and creators of content. The backbone of our content is currently our vast music video library, which we acquired from ScreenPlay.
 
Music videos
 
We believe our music video library is one of the largest in the world and gives us an advantage over many of our competitors, which may have more limited historical libraries. Our music video library contains videos from the 1950s up until 2021, with the newest videos being obtained directly from the music labels. Historical music video libraries are more difficult to obtain, as there is generally no central data base to purchase such videos and the individual music labels who have rights over portions of such videos do not easily and readily provide their entire back catalogue of music videos to those seeking to acquire them.
 
Although we own copies of the music videos that we deliver to our customers, we need to secure the rights to stream the video and sound recordings and the musical compositions embodied therein (i.e., the musical notes and the lyrics) to provide these videos to our customers. To do so we enter into license agreements to obtain licenses from rights holders such as record labels, music publishers, performance rights organizations, collecting societies, and other copyright owners or their agents, and pay royalties to such parties or their agents.
 
We currently have licenses and agreements with multiple parties to distribute our music videos for our OOH and consumer customers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and are looking to expand our reach by securing licenses for other regions, including other countries in South America and, possibly, Europe and Asia. We have longstanding limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain music video recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the three main music labels (the “Music Labels”) to our OOH customers. In 2020, we entered into agreements with the Music Labels, pursuant to which the Company was also provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain music video recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with our D2C business and the provision of music videos to users of the Loop App for mobile and CTV. The last of these agreements was entered into in December 2020 at which time we were able to provide a more complete offering of music video content to our D2C customers.
 
Trailers
 
Our film, game, and TV trailer library is one of our larger video libraries and, like our music video library, includes a back catalog of older videos, dating from the early 1900s to the present. More recent trailers are secured from the relevant production companies, at no cost to us, and add to our growing library. Our back catalogue of older trailers was obtained with the acquisition of ScreenPlay.
Other
 
In addition to music videos and movie trailers, we have obtained other video content for curation and distribution to our customers. This content includes, college sports highlights, viral videos (including “fail” and animal videos), atmospherics, travel, and children’s videos.
 
We continue to explore opportunities to secure other forms of video content to add to our growing content library, including content related to entertainment, lifestyle, and information.
 
Content curation
 
In October 2020 we created a new business division at Loop, called Loop Music Studios (“Loop Studios”), to lead the acquisition, curation, production, and branding of our video content.
 
Loop Studios works to curate content to create a compelling user experience by, among other things, curating playlists by genre, mood, or time periods (“Playlists”) and creating streaming linear channels, delivered under our “watch live tv” product feature, which is organized along genres and moods (“Channels”). We currently have over 80 English language music video Playlists, 65 Spanish language music video Playlists, 65 music video Channels for OOH venues, 13 non-music video Channels for OOH venues, and 24 music video Channels for our consumer end users delivered through the Loop App on CTVs or mobile devices.

Through Loop Studios we are also seeking to produce our own content “in-house” that can be packaged separately or as part of our third-party content offerings through our existing and future Channels.
 
Content distribution
 
We seek to make our content available virtually anywhere and anytime throughout the evolving media landscape. We leverage our existing content across a number of distribution platforms, reaching consumers in OOH venues and via our Loop App on their CTVs and mobile devices. These digital and mobile initiatives are expected to drive growth as users consume content and utilize services across an increasing number of platforms.
 
OOH
 
The foundation of our company was built around OOH: providing licensed music videos to businesses and public venues. Our OOH business has been supporting the hospitality and retail industries with music video services for over 20 years, originally by ScreenPlay, which we acquired in 2019. Our OOH service is targeted at commercial outlets throughout the United States.
 
Most OOH venues deliver visual content to their customers by use of cable TV boxes and computer-based audio-visual (“A/V”) equipment requiring significant investment and cost. Capital investment in equipment has been historically, and in many cases still is, a barrier for many OOH venues to provide visual entertainment to their customers. Unlike consumers in their homes, who have been more willing in recent years to invest in CTVs and streaming services, businesses as a general matter have been slower in adopting often lower cost streaming options and acquiring the related necessary equipment in their OOH venues. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, has accelerated the consideration by OOH operators of lower cost solutions to providing visual content in their venues.
 
Historically, our OOH business model was a Premium Service-only model and required computer hardware for the provision of content. With a Premium Service OOH model, business owners would pay a monthly subscription fee and we would provide them with curated business Channels for which they subscribed. Customers would purchase computer hardware equipment from us in order for us to deliver the content to them and for them to play the content through their A/V systems to the televisions in their venues. The customers signing up for our Premium Service were primarily bars and restaurants, but also included casinos and retail stores.
 
To gain greater access to, and expand our business with, OOH venues, we developed the Loop Player (the “Loop Player”), our own proprietary “small-box” streaming video player that plugs directly into a television’s HDMI video input, or can be plugged into an A/V system to stream video content to multiple television sets. We originally offered the Loop Player at a relatively low cost to OOH businesses but have more recently offered free Loop Players to businesses, which eliminates the need for OOH customers to pay for costly computer hardware and allows us to introduce more easily an Ad-Supported Service to such OOH customers. The Ad-Supported Service also eliminates a business customer’s monthly subscription fees. We believe the Loop Player and our Ad-Supported Service has brought the cost of specialty equipment and visual entertainment significantly down for business owners who replace their existing equipment and service with our Loop Player, as there is no payment from the OOH venue operators for our Loop Player or Ad-Supported Service.
 
The Loop Player was introduced in early 2020, but the push to get it into the hands of business owners only began in earnest in the 4th quarter of 2020. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in early 2020 and caused many businesses to shut down or reduce capacity, has accelerated the demand of business owners to look for CTVs and streaming services, including the Loop Player, to reduce their costs. We believe the introduction of our Loop Player and the switch to an Ad-Supported business model for our OOH business has contributed in recent months to the growth of our OOH clients and the expansion of our client base beyond our typical hospitality-based clients to smaller venues, franchisees and venues that service non-hospitality industries, like pet stores, doctors’ offices, and other non-traditional venues.
 
The Loop Player allows us to stream content over the Internet to retail consumers without the need for a cable subscription or a CTV. Our OOH service is also offered to business customers by downloading our on-line business application through CTVs and other streaming video players like the Amazon Fire Stick, Roku Streaming devices, and native television manufacturer applications such as Vizio. In the near term, customers switching from a Premium Service, which was the primary contributor to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, to an Ad-Supported Service may adversely impact our revenues as the Ad-Supported Service ramps up. Over time, however, the Ad-Supported Service is expected to provide more revenue than our Premium Service for individual OOH customers as we are increasingly able to fill advertising inventory in our content with paid advertisements. OOH commercial and public venues provide advertisers with access to multiple consumers at once, as opposed to, for instance, a single consumer viewing an advertisement on their individual mobile device. This makes an Ad-Supported Service for our OOH business more attractive to us than a Premium Service. OOH business customers who do not want advertising displayed on the content streamed to their venues can choose a Premium Service with ad-free content streamed by the Loop Player for a subscription fee.
 
The Loop Player allows our clients to program their in-store monitors and audio systems to, among other things, schedule Playlists to come on and off depending on the time of day, promote a client’s products or services through digital signage, or deliver franchise or company-wide messages to staff in back office or break room locations. Business owners can filter out content based on ratings or explicit language and can control which genres of videos to exclude from their programming. Business owners can also use our scheduling function to play specific playlists that highlight the natural rhythms of their businesses (e.g., special promotional nights or relaxed lunchtimes).

The Loop Player is a lightweight, interactive solution for a business’ A/V and communication needs. The Loop Player comes with an expanded local memory for offline caching and provides a failsafe in the event of loss of internet connection. The OOH streaming player is also equipped with a wide range of direct outputs for various A/V setups including audio and stereo outputs, ethernet plugin, USB 2, USB 3, HDMI, SD input, and Bluetooth.
 
Our OOH Playlists last between 5-10 hours to reduce the number of repeats of videos and are pre-screened for content that may not be appropriate for businesses.
 
Mobile applications
 
We have developed mobile and internet applications such as the Loop App smart phone application and our online app accessed through OTT platforms for the distribution of our music video content only. These mobile and internet applications allow users of our Ad-Supported Service to use their smart phones, tablets, or other digital devices to interact directly with our Channels and Playlists, while providing an additional method for advertisers to reach consumers. For Premium users they are given enhanced functionality to search for titles of music videos and artists, request music videos, and create custom and personalized “Loops”. Our Loop App was made available in mid-2020, but we have not promoted or advertised it in any meaningful way, as we were unable to provide a full music video offering until we secured the last of our three major label licenses in December 2020. As a result, the Loop App mobile application has not experienced significant downloads. We have seen some a heightened number of downloads in Mexico, where we launched the Loop App with an Asian-based communications distribution partner.
 
OTT /MVPDs
 
For non-music video content, our licenses generally provide that we can develop the content for linear channels operated by multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”). MVPD operators appear less interested in non-music video content in linear channel format than with music video content, but we will continue to explore the distribution of non-music video content as we seek to develop and provide additional expertly curated and broader content offerings. We do not currently have any significant non-music video content distribution on linear channels.
 
We are exploring the distribution of our music-video content through linear channels on MVPD platforms and have entered into distribution transactions with several such platforms for the distribution of certain of our music video Channels. In order to provide a fully engaging music video Service offering on the linear channels of OTT platforms, we will need to secure additional licensing rights from the Music Labels. We are in discussions with certain of the Music Labels to try and secure additional or expanded licenses, but there is no assurance these licenses will be obtained.
 
Linear channels operate on the MVPD platforms as a standalone linear channel presented by the MVPD operator without the need to access our Loop App. The MVPDs who distribute Channels for us share in our revenue from subscriptions and advertising, as well as other revenue derived from our Channels on their OTT platforms.
 
Our Business Model
 
We offer both Premium and Ad-Supported Services. Our Premium and Ad-Supported Services are separate offerings to end users but work together to help support our business. Our free to the end user Ad-Supported Service serves as a way to acquire users of our Premium Service for our D2C Mobile App users. We prefer customers who obtain our services in our OOH and OTT businesses to remain with our Ad-Supported Services, as we expect to be able to earn more gross revenue with our Ad Supported Service model in these businesses than we do with a Premium Service for the foreseeable future. We believe our Ad-Supported Service will be a strong and viable stand-alone product with good long-term opportunity for growth in Ad-Supported users and revenue; however, we face intense competition in growing both our Ad-Supported users and Premium users, as well as in keeping our users highly engaged. If user engagement declines or if we fail to continue to grow our Ad-Supported user base or Premium subscriber base, our revenue growth will be negatively impacted. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If our efforts to attract prospective users and to retain existing users are not successful, our growth prospects and revenue will be adversely affected.”
 
We are currently primarily focused on the United States with our OOH and D2C businesses but have sought to expand our D2C businesses in Canada and Mexico, with other South American countries to potentially follow along, possibly with parts of Europe and Asia. Expanding our OOH business outside the United States is also being considered but may require more of a physical presence by us on the ground in certain jurisdictions in order to grow that business in any meaningful way.

We are targeting OOH businesses that are looking to provide premium curated video content to their customers and consumers who are looking to access premium music video content in their homes and on their mobile devices.
 
Our primary business is the provision of content to our OOH business customers, giving them music video and other video content that will provide their customers with access to our vast video library through Playlists and Channels. Our service to OOH businesses is both Premium and Ad-Supported.
 
Our business plan also includes a second revenue stream from users who download our Loop App, giving them access to our vast video library through Playlists, Channels, Loops, and on demand searches. Our Loop App can be accessed as a Premium or Ad-Supported Service.
 
Our business plan further contemplates a third future potential revenue stream which would come from OTT customers, giving them music video and other video content that would provide subscribers to the relevant third-party OTT services with access to our vast video library through Channels. We expect that our service to OTT platform providers will primarily be Ad-Supported as many of the providers run a free advertising supported television, or FAST, business model for Channels on their services.
 
Our Growth Strategies
 
We are in the early stages of our business model to monetize our music video content library obtained from ScreenPlay and all other video content licensed from third-party content providers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, substantially all our revenues were derived from the historical business of ScreenPlay, which relies on a Subscription service-based model using older and more expensive A/V technology. Our revenues for 2020 did not contain any significant contribution from any Ad-Supported Services or the provision of the Loop Player to OOH venues or our Loop App to retail consumer end users.
 
Our growth strategies are focused on monetizing and growing our content library by (i) increased marketing to OOH venues to increase the number of OOH venues are Service is in; (ii) cross promotional marketing to consumer end users of our Services to grow the number of users our Services reach; (ii) acquiring, licensing and developing our non-music video content library to enhance margins and broaden our reach; (iii) attracting more users in current and new markets in order to collect more behavioral data, which we use to offer our customers, users and advertisers an even better experience; (iv) invest in our advertising partners; and (v) expand operations internationally.
 
The key elements of our growth strategy are:
 

● | Increase marketing efforts targeting OOH venues. We have found online digital advertising to be a successful customer acquisition strategy and a direct correlation between funds spent for online advertising and businesses signing up for our Loop Player. The more we spend on advertising, the more businesses sign up for our Loop Player. The Loop Player can be shipped direct to an OOH venue after an online sign up by the venue operator. The Loop Player is easily installed by the venue operator, without the need for a Loop employee or representative to be physically located at the venue location. In addition to digital advertising to individual businesses, we are also looking to increase our direct marketing efforts by our internal sales team in order to target large, national or regional, franchisee or corporate owned, businesses, to promote our Loop Player and Services to them. See “Marketing and Sales.”

● | Increasing the visibility and use of our Loop App. The presence of our Service in OOH venues provides us with great access to our consumer target market. We run cross promotional advertisements through our Loop Player on our OOH Service that seeks to encourage consumers to download and experience our Loop App on their mobile devices or in their homes on CTVs. We believe the expansion of our OOH business will give greater exposure to our D2C Services and help grow the use of our Loop App. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our non-music video content. Our music video content library is the foundation of our business, but has significant costs associated with it as it requires us to make significant payments to the Music Labels and other rights holders. In addition, certain OOH venues are looking for a broader or more targeted content offering than pure music videos. Since the acquisition of ScreenPlay’s music video library, we have sought to expand our non-music video content by adding and curating additional non-music content, which in most instances provides better economics to us than music video content. We hope to expand our offering over time to include additional non-music content, such as entertainment, lifestyle, and information and we are actively engaged with potential content partners to achieve this goal. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversify our customer base. We believe the introduction of our Loop Player and the switch to an Ad-Supported business model for our OOH business has contributed in recent months to the growth of our OOH clients and the expansion of our client base beyond our typical hospitality-based clients to smaller venues, franchisees, and venues that service non-hospitality industries, like pet stores, doctors’ offices, and other non-traditional venues. This expansion has given us greater insight into the viewing habits of a diverse customer base and an outlet and demand for some of our non-music video content (e.g., animal related video content for pet stores or children’s focused videos for pediatricians’ offices). We will continue to expand the types of OOH customers we target.

● | Expand internationally. We primarily operate in the United States. We believe the non-U.S. market is underserved in the provision of video content to OOH venues and D2C end users and are exploring the expansion of our business to service these markets. We may initially look to expand to certain countries in South America and Asia if we believe a presence in those countries will enhance revenues and profitability over the long term. In 2020 we launched our Loop App in Mexico and took a non-controlling interest in EON Media, Inc. (“EON Media”) in Asia. Eon Media has a weekly syndicated radio program targeted across Asia and we believe this will be a good platform for us to expand our operations to the region. If opportunities present themselves in other countries and regions outside the United States, we may pursue them as well.

License Agreements
 
In order to stream video content to our users, we generally secure intellectual property rights to such content by obtaining licenses from, and paying royalties or other consideration to, rights holders or their agents. Below is a summary of certain provisions of our license agreements relating to music videos and the musical compositions embodied therein), as well as other non-music video content.
 
Music video and A/V recordings license agreements with major and independent record labels
 
We have license agreements with the recorded music affiliates of the three largest music companies: Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group. These agreements require us to pay royalties and make minimum guaranteed advanced payments, and they include marketing commitments, advertising inventory, and financial and data reporting obligations. Rights to A/V recordings granted pursuant to these agreements is expected to account for the vast majority of our music video use for the foreseeable future. Generally, these license agreements have a short duration and are not automatically renewable. The license agreements also allow for the licensor to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances, including, for example, our failure to timely pay sums due within a certain period, our breach of material terms, and in some situations that could constitute a “change of control” of Loop. These agreements generally provide that the licensors have the right to audit us for compliance with the terms of these agreements. Further, they contain “most favored nations” provisions, which require that certain material contract terms be at least as favorable as the terms we have agreed to with any other similarly situated licensor. Our license agreements with the largest music companies for our OOH business were entered into years ago and those music companies have requested a review and update of those licenses. The updating of those licenses (or entering into new licenses to cover our OOH business) is expected to increase our license costs associated with such rights, including our minimum guarantee payment obligations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Minimum guarantees required under certain of our license agreements may limit our operating flexibility and may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.”
 
Musical composition license agreements


With respect to the underlying musical compositions embodied in the music video recordings we stream, we generally secure both reproduction and public performance rights from the owners, publishers, or administrators of the compositions (or their agents). We have obtained direct licenses for reproduction rights with the three largest music publishers for our consumer business and are in the process of obtaining such licenses for our OOH business. If our business does not perform as expected or if the rates are modified to be higher than the proposed rates, our music video content acquisition costs could increase, which could negatively harm our business, operating results, and financial condition, hinder our ability to provide interactive features in our services, or cause one or more of our services not to be economically viable due to an increase in content acquisition costs.
 
In the United States, public performance rights are generally obtained through intermediaries known as performance rights organizations (“PROs), which negotiate blanket licenses with copyright users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory, collect royalties under such licenses, and distribute those royalties to music publishers and songwriters. We have obtained public performance licenses from, and pay license fees to, the PROs in the United States: the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), the SESAC Performing Rights, LLC (“SESAC”), and Global Music Rights, LLC (“GMR”). These agreements impose music usage reporting obligations on Loop and grant audit rights in favor of the PROs. In addition, these agreements typically have one-to-two-year terms, and some have continuous renewal provisions, with either party able to terminate for convenience with one to two months’ prior written notice and are limited to the territory of the United States and its territories and possessions.
 
License agreements with non-music video content
 
With respect to non-music video content for which we obtain distribution rights directly from rights holders, we either negotiate licenses directly with individuals or entities. These license agreements require us to share associated revenues.

License agreement extensions, renewals, and expansions
 
From time to time, our license agreements with certain rights holders and/or their agents expire while we negotiate their renewals. Per industry custom and practice, we may enter into brief (for example, month-, week-, or even days-long) extensions of those agreements or provisional licenses and/or continue to operate on an at will basis as if the license agreement had been extended, including by our continuing to make content available. It is also possible that such agreements will never be renewed at all. License agreements are generally restrictive as to how the licensed content is accessed, displayed, and manipulated, as licensors seek to protect the use of their content. In order to provide the highest level of Services and best experience for our customers and end users, we may from time to time seek expansion of our licenses to provide us with greater functionality of our Services as it relates to the relevant content. The inability to expand our licenses, or the lack of renewal, or termination, of one or more of our license agreements, or the renewal of a license agreement on less favorable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We depend upon third-party licenses for substantially all of the content we stream and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.”
 
Competition
 
Our competitive market is made up of a variety of small to large companies, depending upon the area that we are competing within.
 
In the OOH market, we compete with several small, fragmented companies. Our direct competitors include Atmosphere, Stingray, and Rockbot. We believe that the major competitive factors in our OOH marketplace are price, technology, quality music video content, and other entertainment content.
 
In the OTT market, we compete with a significant number of large and small companies as we compete to secure our service on OTT devices and, once on the service, we compete for individual viewers of our product. Our competitors include Vevo, Jukin Media, and Stingray. We believe that the major competitive factors in our OTT marketplace are quality content and revenue share splits.
 
In the consumer application market, we compete with a large number of audio-only companies for music but very few for music videos. Our direct competitors include Xcite and YouTube Music. We believe that the major competitive factors in our OOH marketplace are stickiness/social aspects of the relevant mobile application, curation, and price.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused on reaching our OOH customers. Historically, our sales cycle from first contact with a potential customer to adoption of our Services was relatively long and met with varying degrees of success, as the A/V equipment required to run our Service was often considered expensive by many of the venues looking to acquire it. Our sales and marketing efforts depended almost entirely on direct marketing by our internal sales representatives, including multiple contacts, onsite demonstrations of our services, and potentially on-site installation and technical support, when needed. The introduction of our Loop Player for OOH venues has enabled us to adopt a digital marketing strategy, in addition to our direct marketing.
 
Upon introduction of our proprietary Loop Player, our sales and marketing strategy for OOH customers has consisted of a bottom-up and top-down approaches. Our bottom-up approach markets our Loop Player and our OOH business through digital marketing to potential business customers for use at their individual venues. The marketing reaches these businesses through the Internet, mobile devices, social media, search engines, and other digital channels. Our digital marketing campaign targets businesses in certain industries that are more likely to take up our Services and become a customer, as determined by our past experience and by analyzing and identifying leads sourced from our online marketing channels. We are able to mail a physical Loop Player to individual businesses that sign up for our services online and are verified by us and then utilize our team of customer service personnel, digital prompts, including text messages, and promotional rewards to ensure activation of the Loop Player after receipt by the potential customer. For Subscription Services, a sales representative will call the potential business customer to better communicate the various subscription services pricing and availability.
 
Our top-down approach for OOH marketing and sales relies on our internal sales team targeting large, national or regional, franchisee or corporate-owned, businesses, to promote our Loop Player and Services in multiple venues controlled by them. We often will obtain a lead into these businesses from individual venues in such business’ network of venue operators and owners. The top-down approach has a longer sales cycle, but often results in a greater reach and distribution of our Loop Player and Services to multiple venues at a single time, once adopted.
 
Our sales and marketing efforts on our D2C consumer business is more limited and relies on our internal direct marketing and sales team to approach various Smart TV and CTV operators, distributors, and manufacturers. We seek to meet their needs by providing compelling content for their networks and platforms through our Loop App or otherwise.
 
We also seek to cross-promote our OOH and D2C businesses on each respective platform and believe greater penetration of our OOH business will help drive exposure to the public consumers of our D2C products.

Intellectual Property
 
We have developed our own software, computer code and related items to provide our service and do not materially rely on any third-party providers for the same. Our Loop Player is a proprietary device, designed by us and is subject to patents.
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret, and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes, and other intellectual property. We will protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants, and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy, or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology.
 
U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented, or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and our pending patents, if issued, and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.”
