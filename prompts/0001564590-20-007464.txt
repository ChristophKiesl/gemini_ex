Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Tivity Health, Inc. (the “Company”), a leading provider of fitness, nutrition, and social connection solutions, was founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1981.  On March 8, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Nutrisystem, Inc. (“Nutrisystem”), a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs sold primarily through the Internet and telephone and multi-day kits and single items (a la carte) available at select retail locations.  The acquisition of Nutrisystem enables us to offer, at scale, an integrated portfolio of solutions to help people live longer and be healthier, including our SilverSneakers® senior fitness program, Nutrisystem®, South Beach Diet®, Prime® Fitness, WholeHealth Living®, and Wisely WellTM (launched in 2020).   

Following the acquisition of Nutrisystem, we organize and manage our operations within two reportable segments, based on the types of products and services they offer: Healthcare and Nutrition.  The Healthcare segment is comprised of our legacy business and includes SilverSneakers, Prime Fitness and WholeHealth Living.  The Nutrition segment is comprised of Nutrisystem’s legacy business and includes Nutrisystem and the South Beach Diet.
 
As part of our Healthcare segment, SilverSneakers is offered to members of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans.  We also offer Prime Fitness, a fitness facility access program, through commercial health plans, employers, and other sponsoring organizations.  Our national network of fitness centers delivers both SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness.  Our fitness networks encompass approximately 17,000 partner locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations that provide classes outside of traditional fitness centers. Through our WholeHealth Living program, which we sell primarily to health plans, we offer a continuum of services related to complementary, alternative, and physical medicine.  Our WholeHealth Living network includes relationships with approximately 80,000 complementary, alternative, and physical medicine practitioners to serve individuals through health plans and employers who seek health services such as chiropractic care, acupuncture, physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, and more.
 
Our Nutrition segment includes Nutrisystem and the South Beach Diet. Typically, our Nutrition segment customers purchase monthly food packages containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and flex meals, which they supplement, depending on the program they are following, with items such as fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, lean protein and dairy. Most Nutrition segment customers order on an auto-delivery basis (“Auto-Delivery”), which means we send a four-week meal plan on an ongoing basis until notified of a customer’s cancellation. Auto-Delivery customers are offered savings off of our regular one-time rate with each order. Monthly notifications are also sent to remind customers to update order preferences. We offer pre-selected favorites or customers may personalize their meal plan by selecting their entire menu or by customizing plans to their specific tastes or dietary preference. In total, our plans feature approximately 250 food options including frozen and unfrozen ready-to-go entrees, snacks, and shakes, at different price points. Additionally, we offer unlimited counseling from our trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators at no cost. Counselors are available as needed, seven days a week throughout an extended day, with further support provided through our digital tools.  The Nutrition segment also offers its products through select retailers and QVC, a television shopping network.
 The Company is headquartered at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, Tennessee 37067.
 Customer and Partner Contracts
 Except for Prime Fitness, our Healthcare segment’s customer contracts generally have initial terms of approximately three years.  Some contracts allow the customer to terminate early and/or determine on an annual basis to which of their members they will offer our programs.  For Prime Fitness, our contracts with employers, commercial health plans, and other sponsoring organizations generally have initial terms of approximately three years, while individuals who purchase the Prime Fitness program through these organizations may cancel at any 
 4

time (on a monthly basis) after an initial period of one to three months. Direct to consumer customers in our Nutrition segment may cancel at any time.  Our fitness partner location contracts generally have initial terms ranging from one to three years and auto-renew for successive one-year renewal terms. 
 Business Strategy
 
Tivity Health’s integrated portfolio of fitness, nutrition and social engagement solutions supports overall health and wellness programs, which we believe are critical to our health plan and employer-based customers.  Following the acquisition of Nutrisystem, we believe the Company is well-positioned to address food insecurity, inactivity, weight management, chronic conditions, and social isolation, leading to a reduction of healthcare costs.  We believe the diversification of our portfolio and increased scale will benefit all of the Company’s stakeholders – including government and commercial health plans, fitness partners, members and consumers – as our offerings support healthier lifestyles and can lower medical costs.
 
Our comprehensive “A-B-C-D” strategy has been strengthened with the acquisition of Nutrisystem.  Strategy (A), add new members, will leverage Nutrisystem’s media expertise and scale to increase awareness of the SilverSneakers program and drive more enrolled members.  We will also cross-promote our nutrition and fitness solutions while adding new distribution channels for Nutrisystem. Strategy (B), build more awareness, empowerment and engagement, will lean on Nutrisystem’s precision marketing competency to drive visits and present a host of nutrition offerings to SilverSneakers and Prime Fitness members.  Strategy (C), collaborate with health plan partners to introduce new products and services that leverage our brand trust, drove our acquisition of Nutrisystem and will position us to offer nutrition-based as well as combined offerings.  Strategy (D), deepen relationships with our fitness center partners and their instructors within our national network, is bolstered through the Nutrisystem acquisition by providing new potential revenue streams for fitness partner locations while offering yet another distribution channel for Nutrisystem through those partner locations.  Our focus on revenue synergies is to address chronic conditions and weight management and expand the channels of distribution for nutrition-based products.
 
The Nutrition segment operates in a competitive direct-to-consumer market that is experiencing significant change. To respond to these changes, in addition to the total company A-B-C-D strategy discussed above, we are applying a two-pronged “O-E” strategy to: (O) optimize the core nutrition business, and (E) expand the business by (1) expanding reach beyond direct-to-consumer, including opportunities with our health plan partners and fitness partner locations and (2) leveraging our food science capabilities beyond weight loss so that we can address the broader opportunity of nutrition-based solutions and continue to differentiate ourselves in the market.
 Segment and Major Customer Information
 
Following the acquisition of Nutrisystem in March 2019, we organize and manage our operations within two reportable segments, based on the types of products and services they offer: Healthcare and Nutrition.  The Healthcare segment consists of SilverSneakers senior fitness, Prime Fitness and WholeHealth Living.  The Nutrition segment provides weight management products and services and consists of Nutrisystem and South Beach Diet.
 During 2019, Humana, Inc. (“Humana”) comprised approximately 13% of our consolidated revenues. Our primary contract with Humana continues through December 31, 2022.  No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2019.  In addition, during 2019, three customers individually comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 45%, of our Healthcare segment’s revenues for 2019. See Note 18 to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report relating to revenues from external customers and customer concentration.
 Competition
 The healthcare and weight loss industries are both highly competitive, and the manner in which services are provided is subject to continual change. Other entities, whose financial and marketing resources may exceed our resources, may choose to initiate or expand programs in competition with our offerings.
 We believe we have certain advantages over our competitors in the healthcare segment such as:
  
• | our proprietary class programming;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the brand recognition of our programs such as SilverSneakers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 5

 
• | the depth and breadth of our fitness center network relationships, which encompass approximately 17,000 partner locations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the trusting connections with our members developed over more than 25 years that have generated nearly 800 million member visits to partner locations since 2001.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other entities who provide similar services.
 The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors providing pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants, nutritional supplements, and surgical procedures. Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting, and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, and meal replacement products, as well as medically supervised programs.
 We believe that our principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are: 
  
• | the availability, convenience, privacy, and effectiveness of the weight loss program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brand recognition and trustworthiness;
--+---------------------------------------


• | digital and media spending;
--+----------------------------


• | new products and innovative offerings;
--+---------------------------------------


• | program pricing; and
--+---------------------


• | the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight loss industry. However, we have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors. By providing well-recognized food-based weight management programs using the direct to consumer channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.  
 Industry Integration and Consolidation
 Consolidation remains an important factor in all aspects of the healthcare industry.  While we believe the size of our membership base provides us with the economies of scale to compete even in a consolidating market, we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other entities that already have or contract for programs similar to ours or are not interested in our programs.
Governmental Regulation
 Governmental regulation impacts us in a number of ways in addition to those regulatory risks presented under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below.
 Health Reform
 In recent years, Congress and certain state governments have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to result in major changes within the healthcare system. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), the most prominent of these efforts, changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through, among other things, expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to care quality and value. 
 The ACA contains provisions that affect our customers, including commercial health plans and Medicare Advantage programs. Since 2010, when the ACA was enacted, the ACA has decreased the number of uninsured individuals, and expanded coverage through the expansion of public programs and private sector health insurance. However, the ACA also may increase costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA prohibits commercial health plans from using gender, health status, family 
 6

history, or occupation to set premium rates, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and bans annual benefit limits. In addition, the ACA established uniform minimum medical loss ratios (“MLRs”) for health plans, requiring a minimum percentage of health coverage premium revenue to be spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses. The ACA also reduced premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans such that the managed care per capita payments paid by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to Medicare Advantage plans are now, on average, approximately equal to those for traditional Medicare.
 There is substantial uncertainty regarding the ongoing effects of the ACA because the presidential administration and Congress have made significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. The President has signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the ACA. Final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential benefits mandated by the ACA.  Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the ACA’s individual mandate. In December 2018, a federal court in Texas ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional as a result of this change and determined that the rest of the ACA was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. The law remains in effect pending appeal. It is difficult to predict whether, when or how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative provisions, if any, will be enacted, the timing of implementation of any alternative provisions, the impact of alternative provisions on providers and other healthcare industry participants, and the ultimate outcome and impact of court challenges. The healthcare industry remains subject to ongoing health reform initiatives. For example, beginning in 2020, the Creating High-quality Results and Outcomes Necessary to Improve Chronic (CHRONIC) Care Act of 2018 (“Chronic Care Act”) allows Medicare Advantage plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health.  Additionally, some presidential candidates and members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals (often referred to as "Medicare for All"). Further, the outcome of the 2020 federal election and its potential impact on health reform efforts is unknown. 
 Other Laws
 While many of the governmental and regulatory requirements affecting healthcare delivery generally do not directly apply to us, our customers must comply with a variety of regulations including those governing Medicare Advantage plans and their marketing and the licensing and reimbursement requirements of federal, state and local agencies. Certain of our services, including health service utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by state government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses.
 Federal privacy regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) extensively restrict the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information by health plans, most healthcare providers, and certain other entities (collectively, “covered entities”). Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA require covered entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic individually-identifiable health information. Because we handle individually-identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities, we are considered a "business associate" and are required to comply with most aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties for each violation. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 In the event of a data breach involving individually-identifiable health information, we are subject to contractual obligations and state and federal requirements that require us to notify our customers. These requirements may also require us or our customers to notify affected individuals, regulatory agencies, and the media of the data breach. Under HIPAA, non-permitted uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice is required, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.
 In addition, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing the confidentiality and security of confidential personal information that may apply to us directly or us contractually. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the potential effects of the CCPA (as defined under Item1A “Risk Factors”) are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. In addition, 
 7

the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, and criminal penalties. 
 Federal law contains various prohibitions related to false statements and false claims, some of which apply to private payors as well as federal programs. Our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans may subject us to a number of obligations, including billing and reimbursement requirements, prohibitions on fraudulent and abusive conduct and related training and screening obligations. Actions may be brought under the federal False Claims Act by the government as well as by private individuals, known as “whistleblowers,” who are permitted to share in any settlement or judgment. Liability under the federal False Claims Act arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly. There are many other potential bases for liability under the federal False Claims Act, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. The submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of certain “fraud and abuse” provisions of the Social Security Act, including the anti-kickback provisions, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the federal False Claims Act. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government, and some courts have taken the position that entities that allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the federal self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the federal False Claims Act.
 From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including the Company and our customers, may be subject to actions under the federal False Claims Act or other fraud and abuse laws, including similar state statutes, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such actions. Violations of applicable laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. For example, violations of the federal False Claims Act may result in penalties of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.
 Because of the international operations previously conducted as part of our total population health services (“TPHS”) business that we sold to Sharecare, Inc. in July 2016, we were subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties.
 In addition, our Nutrition segment is subject to laws and regulations relating to advertising, disclosures to customers, customer pricing and billing arrangements and other customer protection matters.  Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future. Other aspects of our Nutrition segment’s operations, such as the manufacturing, labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to government regulation, including USDA and FDA requirements.  Because our Nutrition segment includes distributing products that are ingested, we face inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and improper labeling claims.  A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that our practices do not meet such laws or regulations could result in legal liability, adverse publicity, and require us to modify our practices and incur substantial costs and expenses.
 Intellectual Property
 We own numerous trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
Employees
 As of February 21, 2020, we had approximately 1,000 employees. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.

Seasonality
 Typically, in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. We believe that the Nutrition segment of our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.
