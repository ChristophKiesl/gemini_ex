Item 1.    Business.
Federal Signal Corporation, founded in 1901, was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1969. The Company designs, manufactures and supplies a suite of products and integrated solutions for municipal, governmental, industrial and commercial customers. The Company’s portfolio of products that it manufactures includes sewer cleaners, vacuum trucks, street sweepers, waterblasters, and safety and security systems, including technology-based products and solutions for the public safety market. Following the acquisition of Joe Johnson Equipment, the Company also distributes and re-sells products manufactured by other companies, which include refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice resurfacing equipment and snow-removal equipment. In addition, we sell parts and provide service, repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a comprehensive offering to our customers. Federal Signal Corporation and its subsidiaries operate ten principal manufacturing facilities in five countries around the world and provide products and integrated solutions to customers in all regions of the world.
Narrative Description of Business
Products manufactured and supplied, and services rendered, by the Company are divided into two major operating segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. Corporate contains those items that are not included in our operating segments.
Financial information concerning the Company’s two operating segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, is included in Note 15 – Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding the Company’s discontinued operations is included in Note 18 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
Environmental Solutions Group
Our Environmental Solutions Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a full range of street sweeper vehicles, sewer cleaner and vacuum loader trucks, hydro-excavation trucks and high-performance waterblasting equipment. Products are sold to both municipal and industrial customers under the Elgin®, Vactor®, Guzzler®, WestechTM and Jetstream® brand names. The Group manufactures vehicles and equipment in the U.S. and Canada.
Under the Elgin brand name, the Company sells a leading U.S. brand of street sweepers primarily designed for large-scale cleaning of curbed streets, parking lots and other paved surfaces utilizing mechanical sweeping, vacuum and recirculating air technology. Vactor is a leading manufacturer of vacuum trucks used to maintain sewer lines, catch basins and storm sewers, as well as hydro-excavation trucks to meet the need for safe and non-destructive excavation. Guzzler is a leader in industrial vacuum loaders used to manage industrial waste or recover and recycle valuable raw materials. Westech is a manufacturer of high-quality, rugged vacuum trucks. Jetstream manufactures high pressure waterblast equipment and accessories for commercial and industrial cleaning and maintenance operations. 
In addition to equipment sales, the Group engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a complete offering to its customers under the FS SolutionsSM brand. 
On June 3, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Joe Johnson Equipment, Inc. and Joe Johnson Equipment (USA), Inc. (collectively, “JJE”), a Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. The acquisition of JJE extends the Group’s existing sales channel and increases the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. The acquisition also broadens the Group’s product offerings to include other products, such as refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice-resurfacing equipment and snow-removal equipment.
Safety and Security Systems Group
Our Safety and Security Systems Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of comprehensive systems and products that law enforcement, fire rescue, emergency medical services, campuses, military facilities and industrial sites use to protect people and property. Offerings include systems for campus and community alerting, emergency vehicles, first responder interoperable communications and industrial communications, as well as municipal networked security. Specific products include vehicle lightbars and sirens, public warning sirens, general alarm systems, public address systems and public safety software. Products are sold under the Federal SignalTM, Federal Signal VAMA® and Victor® brand names. The Group operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and South Africa.

Discontinued Fire Rescue Group
As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K, on January 29, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Bronto Skylift® business (“Bronto”) that represented the Fire Rescue Group. The consolidated financial statements for all periods presented have been recast to present the operating results of previously divested or exited businesses, including the Fire Rescue Group, as discontinued operations. In addition, disclosures and historical financial information included in Parts I, II and IV of this Form 10-K have been adjusted to exclude information related to the Fire Rescue Group. See Note 18 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. 
Marketing and Distribution
Depending primarily on the type and geographic location of the end-customer, the Environmental Solutions Group uses either a dealer network, including JJE, or direct sales to serve customers. The dealer network focuses primarily on the municipal market. In conjunction with selling vehicles to end-customers, dealer representatives demonstrate vehicle functionality and capability and provide vehicle service. In addition to selling products manufactured by the Company, JJE is a distributor of products manufactured by other companies. The Company believes its national and global dealer networks for vehicles is a distinguishing factor from its competitors. The Environmental Solutions Group’s direct sales channel concentrates on the industrial, utility and construction market segments, and the FS Solutions centers provide post-sale service, ancillary parts and equipment rentals. The acquisition of JJE increases the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. 
The Safety and Security Systems Group sells to industrial customers through wholesalers and distributors who are supported by Company sales personnel or independent manufacturer representatives. Products are also sold to municipal and governmental customers through active independent distributors, as well as through original equipment manufacturers and the direct sales force. The Company sells comprehensive integrated warning and interoperable communications through a combination of the direct sales force and independent distributors. International sales are made through independent foreign distributors or on a direct basis. 
Customers and Backlog
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales in 2016. Of the $674.4 million total orders received in 2016, approximately 45% were from U.S. municipal and governmental customers, 26% were from U.S. commercial and industrial customers and 29% were from non-U.S. customers.
During 2016, the Company’s U.S. municipal and governmental orders decreased by 6% compared to 2015 levels, driven by declines in orders of street sweepers and outdoor warning systems. During 2015, the Company’s U.S. municipal and governmental orders decreased by 11% compared to 2014, primarily attributable to fewer large fleet orders for street sweepers and sewer cleaners. 
During 2016, the Company’s U.S. commercial and industrial orders were essentially unchanged in comparison to 2015 levels, with orders as a result of new product offerings, such as rental equipment and refuse and recycling vehicles, resulting from the JJE acquisition, being largely offset by reduced orders of waterblasting equipment, vacuum trucks and used equipment within the Environmental Solutions Group, as well as lower orders from U.S. industrial markets within the Safety and Security Systems Group. During 2015, the Company’s U.S. commercial and industrial orders decreased by 30% compared to 2014 levels, in large part due to lower vacuum truck orders, which were adversely impacted, directly and indirectly, by a severe downturn in oil and gas markets and, to a lesser extent, by softness in other industrial markets.
During 2016, the Company’s non-U.S. orders increased by 4% from 2015, largely due to a substantial increase in Canadian orders, which was reflective of orders acquired in, and received subsequent to, the JJE acquisition, partially offset by declines in orders of vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners and a $8.5 million decrease in orders for street sweepers and waterblasting equipment in the Middle East. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, there was a decrease in orders from overseas industrial markets, including international oil, gas and coal markets, as well as reduced orders from international public safety markets. This compared to a decrease of 3% in non-U.S orders in 2015 versus 2014, primarily due to lower demand for industrial products used in oil, gas and coal markets and unfavorable foreign currency effects within the Safety and Security Systems Group. This was partially offset by an increase in orders from European and international public safety markets linked to higher demand, as well as increased orders from Canada within our Environmental Solutions Group.
Of the Company’s non-U.S. orders received in 2016, approximately 58% were from Canada, 21% were from Europe and less than 10% were from any other particular region. Non-U.S. municipal and governmental markets are similar to the

U.S. municipal and governmental markets in that they are largely dependent on tax revenues to support spending and orders may be subject to budgetary cycles and public-entity bid procedures. 
The Company’s backlog totaled $137.0 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $171.3 million at December 31, 2015. Backlogs vary by Group due to the nature of the Company’s products and the buying patterns of its customers. The Environmental Solutions Group has experienced an average backlog that can range from four to five months of shipments and the Safety and Security Systems Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately two months of shipments. Production of the Company’s December 31, 2016 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2017.
Suppliers
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials from around the world for use in the manufacture of its products, although the majority of current purchases are from North American sources. To minimize risks relating to availability, price and quality of key products and components, the Company is party to numerous strategic supplier arrangements. Although certain materials are obtained from either a single-source supplier or a limited number of suppliers, the Company has generally identified alternative sources to minimize the interruption of its business in the event of supply disruptions.
Components critical to the production of the Company’s vehicles, such as engines, are purchased from a select number of suppliers. The Company also purchases raw and fabricated steel, as well as commercial chassis, from multiple sources. As a distributor of equipment manufactured by other companies, JJE relies on the availability of equipment supplied by others to meet customer demand. 
While there are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of certain raw materials and components that could impact price, quality and availability in sufficient quantities, the Company believes it has adequate supplies and sources of availability of the raw materials and components necessary to meet its needs.
Competition
Within the Environmental Solutions Group, Elgin is recognized as a market leader among domestic sweeper competitors and differentiates itself primarily on product performance. The Vactor and Guzzler brands each maintain a leading domestic position in their respective marketplaces by enhancing product performance with leading technology and application flexibility. Jetstream is a market leader in the in-plant cleaning segment of the U.S. waterblast industry, competing on product performance, rapid delivery and solutions services. JJE is a leading Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets.
Within specific product categories and domestic markets, the businesses within the Safety and Security Systems Group are among the market leaders. The Group’s international market position varies from leader to ancillary participant depending on the geographic region and product line. Generally, competition is intense within all of the Group’s product lines and purchase decisions are made based on price, features, reputation, performance and service, often within competitive bidding situations.
Research and Development
The Company invests in research to support the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products and services. The Company believes this investment is important to maintain or enhance its leadership position in key markets. Expenditures for research and development by the Company were $13.4 million in 2016, $14.0 million in 2015 and $13.1 million in 2014, and were reported within Selling, engineering, general and administrative (“SEG&A”) expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of patents and possesses rights under others to which it attaches importance, but it does not believe that its business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. The Company also owns a number of trademarks, including those listed within the “Narrative Description of Business” section above. We believe these trademarks are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no material part of the Company’s business is dependent on our trademarks.
Employees
The Company employed approximately 2,200 people in its businesses at December 31, 2016, with the Company’s U.S. hourly workers accounting for approximately 42% of its total workforce. Approximately 23% of the Company’s U.S. hourly workers were represented by unions at December 31, 2016. We believe that our labor relations with our employees are good.

Governmental Regulation of the Environment
The Company believes it complies with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. The Company endeavors to establish environmentally-friendly policies and objectives, and believes that these actions are also consistent with cost-effective operating practices. Capital expenditures in 2016 attributable to compliance with such laws were not material. The Company believes that the overall impact of compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
In May 2012, the Company sold a facility in Pearland, Texas. The facility was previously used by the Company’s discontinued Pauluhn business, which manufactured marine, offshore and industrial lighting products. It is probable that the site will require remediation and as such, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of reserves related to the environmental remediation of the Pearland facility have been included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s estimate may change as more information becomes available; however, the costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
Seasonality
Certain of the Company businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal buying or delivery patterns. The Company tends to have lower sales in the first quarter compared to other quarters as a result of these influences.
