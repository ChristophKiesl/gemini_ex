Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 We are a blank check company incorporated on August 17, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 In August 2020, 11,500,000 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock (the “Founder Shares”) were issued to our Sponsor in exchange for the payment of $25,000 of expenses on our behalf, or approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares upon completion of our initial public offering (the “Public Offering”). The per share purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the aggregate number of founder shares issued. In October 2020, our Sponsor transferred 50,000 founder shares to each of our two independent directors at their original purchase price. In November 2020, our Sponsor returned to us at no cost an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares, which we cancelled. In November 2020, we effected a dividend on our founder shares, which was waived by the company’s independent directors, and resulted in our Sponsor owning 8,525,000 founder shares. The holders of our Founder Shares prior to our Public Offering are referred to herein as our “initial stockholders.”
 On the Closing Date, we consummated the Public Offering of 34,500,000 units (the “Units”), including 4,500,000 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $345,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of our Class A common stock and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant (a “public warrant”) entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, and only whole warrants are exercisable. The public warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12 months from the closing of the Public Offering, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 On November 30, 2020, simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 9,900,000 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $9,900,000. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. The Private Placement Warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
 Approximately $345,000,000 of the net proceeds from the Public Offering and the private placement with the Sponsor has been deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “Trust Account”).
 We received gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $345,000,000 and $9,900,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $354,900,000. $345,000,000 of the gross proceeds were deposited into the Trust Account. The $345,000,000 of net proceeds held in the Trust Account includes $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions that will be released to the underwriters of the Public Offering upon completion of our initial business combination. Of the gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants that were not deposited in the Trust Account, $6,900,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions in the Public Offering, approximately $235,000 was used to repay loans and advances from an affiliate of our Sponsor, and the balance was reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses.
 The shares of our Class B common stock that we issued prior to the Closing Date will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, 
 1


subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in our Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which the shares of our Class B common stock will convert into shares of our Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of our Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination).
 On January 15, 2021, we announced that, commencing January 15, 2021, holders of the Units sold in our Public Offering may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and public warrants included in the Units. The shares of Class A common stock and public warrants that are separated will trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbols “SPRQ” and “SPRQ WS,” respectively. Those units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “SPRQ U.”
 Proposed Business Combination
 On January 23, 2021, we entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with SL Invest I Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“MergerCo1”), SL Invest II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“MergerCo2”), SL Financial Investor I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Holdings I”), SL Financial Investor II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Holdings II”), SL Financial Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Spartan Sub”), SL Financial LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“OpCo Merger Sub” and collectively with MergerCo1, MergerCo2, Holdings I, Holdings II and the Company , the “Spartan Subsidiaries”), Sunlight Financial LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sunlight”), FTV-Sunlight, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“FTV Blocker”) and Tiger Co-Invest B Sunlight Blocker, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Tiger Blocker,” and collectively with FTV Blocker, the “Blockers”). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to closing of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the “Transactions”), the Transactions will effect a business combination between us and Sunlight. Following the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), the combined company will be organized in an “Up-C” structure, meaning that all of the material assets of the combined company will be held by Sunlight, and Spartan’s only material assets will be its equity interests in Sunlight.
 The Boards of Directors of each of the Company (acting following consultation with a duly formed transaction committee) and Sunlight have unanimously approved the Transaction. The Transaction will require the approval of the stockholders of the Company and equity holders of Sunlight, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the transaction, satisfaction of the conditions stated in the definitive agreement and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.
 Sunlight Support Agreement
 In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, on January 23, 2021, certain members of Sunlight whose approval is sufficient to approve and adopt the Business Combination Agreement and the Transactions on behalf of Sunlight’s members (the “Requisite Sunlight Members”), entered into a support agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Requisite Sunlight Members agreed to execute and deliver a written consent approving the Business Combination Agreement and the Transactions within two business days after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and to vote in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the Transactions.

Founders Stock Agreement
 In connection with the entry into the Business Combination Agreement, but effective as of the closing of the Transactions, we and our initial stockholders entered into a Founders Stock Agreement (the “Founders Stock Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to and effective immediately prior to the closing of the Transactions, the Sponsor agreed to surrender up to 25% of the Class B common stock held by the Sponsor (at a 1:4 ratio to the percentage, if any, of redemptions by holders of Class A common stock); provided that no such surrender shall occur unless more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock are actually redeemed by us.
Amendment to Letter Agreement
 In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on January 23, 2021, the Company, the Sponsor and certain other members of our board of directors and/or management team (the “Insiders”) entered into an amendment (the “Letter Agreement Amendment”) to that certain Letter Agreement (the “Existing Letter Agreement”) dated as of November 24, 2020, by and among the Company, our Sponsor and the Insiders, pursuant to which the Sponsor and each Insider will agree, effective as of the closing and subject to certain exceptions, to modify the lock-up restrictions set forth in the Existing Letter Agreement as follows:
 (i)80% of the Class B common stock (including any shares of Class A common stock issued in respect of the conversion of such Class B common stock upon the consummation of a Business Combination (as defined in the Existing Letter Agreement)) held by it, him or her will be restricted from Transfer (as defined in the Letter Agreement Amendment) until the one-year anniversary of the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier if, subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination, (a) the last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period commencing at least 150 days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (b) the Company consummates a transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common A Common Stock and Class B common stock for cash, securities or other property; and
 (ii)20% of the Class B common stock (including any shares of Class A common stock issued in respect of the conversion of such Class B common stock upon the consummation of a Business Combination) held by it, him or her will be restricted from Transfer until the six-month anniversary of the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier if, subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination, (a) the last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending at least 90 days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (b) the Company consummates a transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common A Common Stock and Class B common stock for cash, securities or other property.
 Subscription Agreements
 In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on January 23, 2021, we entered into separate subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with a number of investors (collectively, the “Subscribers”), pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and we agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (the “PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $250,000,000, in a private placement (the “PIPE”).
 The closing of the sale of the PIPE Shares pursuant to the Subscription Agreements is contingent upon, among other customary closing conditions, the concurrent consummation of the Transactions. The purpose of the PIPE is to raise additional capital for use by the combined company following the closing.
 Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, we agreed that, within 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Transactions, we will file with the SEC (at our sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of the PIPE Shares (the “PIPE Resale Registration Statement”), and we will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the PIPE Resale Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof.

Our Company
 Our Sponsor is an affiliate of a private investment fund managed by Apollo. Apollo is led by its Managing Partners, Leon Black, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, who have worked together for over 34 years and who remain involved in Apollo’s strategic leadership, as well as Scott Kleinman and Jim Zelter, Co-Presidents of Apollo Global Management, Inc. who share oversight for all of Apollo’s revenue-generating and investing businesses. Together they lead a team of over 1,700 employees across offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, Bethesda, London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Luxembourg, Mumbai, Delhi, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, among other locations throughout the world (as of December 31, 2020). Apollo’s team possesses a broad range of transaction, financial, managerial and investment skills. Apollo operates its businesses in an integrated manner, which we believe distinguishes Apollo from other alternative asset managers. Apollo’s investment professionals frequently collaborate and share information across disciplines including market insight, management, banking and consultant contacts as well as potential investment opportunities. This collaboration contributes to Apollo’s library of industry knowledge and we believe enables Apollo managed funds to invest successfully across a company’s capital structure.
 From 2001 through December 31, 2020, Apollo Funds have invested or committed to invest approximately $13.9 billion across 46 natural resources-related opportunities, producing an attractive rate of return. Apollo has extensive experience investing across a variety of commodity price cycles and a track record of identifying high-quality assets, businesses and management teams with significant resources, capital and optimization potential.
 Apollo recognizes the importance of ESG issues, and has a long history of taking these issues into account. Apollo believes responsible investment considers how ESG issues impact the firm, the funds it manages and their portfolio companies, the communities in which it and they operate, and the world at large. As one of the world’s largest alternative investment managers, Apollo believes that consideration of ESG issues is essential to companies’ success, by enhancing their ability to manage risks and by identifying areas for cost savings and for growth. Apollo’s ESG program rests on three pillars: thorough ESG diligence; meaningful and tailored engagement with companies post-acquisition; and a commitment to transparency and periodic reporting of qualitative and quantitative ESG information. Apollo believes the processes underlying these three pillars better position company management teams and investment professionals to improve performance on ESG issues. Apollo has endorsed the American Investment Council’s Guidelines for Responsible Investing, and in 2020, Apollo adopted a comprehensive Responsible Investing and ESG Policy with specific policies for each asset class. Apollo also built upon its existing governance infrastructure: firm-wide decisions on ESG issues are now made at the most senior level, led by a steering committee chaired by its Global Head of ESG that includes certain members of Apollo’s senior management. This committee draws on recommendations from cross-functional teams of Apollo professionals across its credit, private equity, and real assets businesses.
 An affiliate of Apollo sponsored Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. (“Spartan I”), a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in August 2018, in which it sold 55,200,000 units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock, for an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $552 million. In July 2020, Spartan I announced its initial business combination with Fisker, which is building a technology-enabled, asset-light automotive business model that it believes has the potential to be among the first of its kind and aligned with the future state of the automotive industry. The transaction closed on October 29, 2020 and the combined entity is listed on the NYSE. We believe that we will benefit from the valuable experience gained by our management team during the launch and operation of Spartan I, including the process of evaluating numerous target companies and industry sectors, selecting Fisker as its business combination partner and negotiating the terms of the business combination agreement and all of the related financing transactions.
 Past performance of Apollo, ANRP III, Spartan I and our management team is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of Apollo’s, ANRP III’s, our management’s or Spartan I’s performance as indicative of our future performance. An investment in us is not an investment in Apollo Funds.
 In addition, Apollo or its affiliates and/or the Apollo Funds may sponsor other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and members of our management

team may participate in such blank check companies. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among the management teams.
 Human Capital Management
 We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 We have registered our Units, Class A common stock and public warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act’), and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to stockholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or reconciled to, GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
