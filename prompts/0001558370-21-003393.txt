ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
History and Company Overview
​
At Home is a leading home décor superstore, and we believe our large format stores dedicate more space per store to home décor than any other player in the industry. We are focused on providing the broadest assortment of everyday and seasonal products for any room, in any style, for any budget. We utilize our space advantage to out-assort our competition, offering over 50,000 SKUs throughout our stores. Our differentiated merchandising strategy allows us to identify on-trend products and then value engineer similar products to provide desirable aesthetics at attractive price points for our customers. Over 75% of our products are unbranded, private label or specifically designed for us. We have developed a highly efficient operating model that seeks to drive growth and profitability while minimizing operating risk. Our merchandising, sourcing and pricing strategies generate strong ticket growth across our product offering and increase store traffic and time in store. Through specialized in-store merchandising and visual navigation elements, we enable a self-service model that minimizes in-store staffing needs and allows us to deliver exceptional value to our customers. We believe with our quickly expanding omnichannel offering, broad and comprehensive assortment, enhanced focus on customer loyalty and compelling value proposition, we are a leading destination for home décor with the opportunity to continue taking market share in a highly fragmented and growing industry.
​
As of January 30, 2021, our store base was comprised of 219 stores across 40 states, averaging approximately 105,000 square feet per store. We utilize a flexible and disciplined real estate strategy that allows us to successfully open and operate stores from 75,000 to 165,000 square feet across a wide range of formats and markets. Our strategy includes opening a number of new stores annually in a mix of new and existing markets, mostly through leasing of second generation properties. All of our stores that were open as of the beginning of fiscal year 2021 are profitable, and stores that have been open for more than a year average approximately $8 million in net sales. We believe our two distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania collectively should be able to support at least 350 stores. In addition, based on our internal analysis and research conducted for us by Buxton Company, a leading real estate analytics firm (referred to herein as “Buxton”), we believe that we have the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the United States over the long term although we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe to reach this potential.
​
In fiscal year 2021, we accelerated our omnichannel capabilities to provide our customers with additional options for purchasing our products, including Buy Online Pick-Up In Store (“BOPIS”), curbside pick-up and local delivery from a substantial majority of store locations.
​
At Home (formerly known as Garden Ridge) was founded in 1979 in Garden Ridge, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio. We quickly gained a loyal following in our Texas home market and expanded thereafter. After our Company was acquired in 2011 by an investment group led by certain affiliates of AEA Investors LP (collectively, “AEA”) and Starr Investment Holdings, LLC (“Starr Investments”), we began a series of strategic investments in the business. 
​
Following open market transactions in fiscal year 2021, AEA and Starr Investments were no longer significant holders of our common stock as of January 30, 2021. 
​
COVID-19 Pandemic
​
The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economies and retail industry, and it has substantially impacted our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In an effort to mitigate the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, various government, regulatory and private entities periodically have implemented significant restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, quarantines, travel

restrictions and restrictions on public gatherings. Due to these restrictions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and a desire to take strong precautions, we closed all of our stores in late March 2020 and gradually opened stores in compliance with state and local mandates. For the last three quarters of fiscal year 2021, our operational and financial performance benefitted from a number of macroeconomic and consumer trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including strong home sales, nesting and de-urbanization and pent-up demand for home décor products.
​
Recurring COVID-19 outbreaks have led to the re-introduction of some restrictions on retail operations in certain jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that our stores will not be subject to modified hours, operations, capacity limitations and store closures in future periods. Due to the size of our stores, we do not expect to be impacted by capacity restrictions, which we believe differentiates us from some of our smaller format competitors. We remain committed to providing our customers with a seamless shopping experience and, in fiscal year 2021, we accelerated our omnichannel capabilities in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to provide our customers with additional options for purchasing our products. 
​
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of other measures to help mitigate the operating and financial impact of the pandemic, including the suspension of all new store openings and remodeling projects with the exception of seven stores that were at or near completion. The COVID-19 pandemic also had, and continues to have, an impact on our third-party supply chain and our inventory. In the spring of 2020, while managing stay-at-home orders and store closures, we canceled orders and reduced the amount of inventory coming into our stores. As store traffic and net sales improved, we sought to strengthen our inventory positions. However, a general increased demand for shipping and other pandemic impacts has led to an increase in freight and transportation costs and product delivery delays.
​
The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, strategy and financial performance will depend largely on future macroeconomic, scientific, health, legal and regulatory developments.
​
Our Merchandise
​
We believe we have the largest assortment of everyday and seasonal home décor products among all big box retailers. With four main design lifestyles, from traditional to global and from farmhouse to modern, we cover the full spectrum of home décor styles and we believe we have something for everyone. We are advantageously situated as a value player in the home décor market, with an average price point of less than $15 and typical customer spend of approximately $75 per visit.
​
We employ an improved everyday low price (“EDLP+”) strategy that offers our customers the best possible pricing without the need for consistent discounts or promotions. We consistently ran EDLP+ campaigns throughout fiscal year 2021 which spanned across a majority of our departments. When customers view our prices, they can be confident in the value they receive and do not need to wait for sales or coupons to make purchasing decisions. We believe this results in continued traffic to our stores and enables the strong product margins that we enjoy across our product offering. Over 80% of our net sales occur at full price, with the balance attributable to limited special buys and selective markdowns used to clear slow-moving inventory or post-dated seasonal product. For the limited set of products that are directly comparable to products offered by other retailers, we seek to offer prices below our specialty competitors and at or below our mass retail competitors. 
​
We have a fully-integrated and centralized merchandising team that is led by our Chief Merchandising Officer and includes specialized teams in buying and product development, trend, inventory planning and allocation and direct sourcing. Our trend team brings designer-level aesthetics to customers at competitive price points, and our sourcing organization drives our success as a value player. 
​
Our merchant team focused on SKU rationalization in fiscal year 2021 by identifying the least productive SKUs with the goal to reduce our overall SKU count. In fiscal year 2021, our efforts were focused on décor, textiles, accent furniture and rugs. Within these departments, we reallocated inventory dollars from lower performing items to those with higher returns. 
​

Product Mix
​
Home furnishings, which generally consists of accent furniture, furniture, mirrors, patio cushions, rugs and wall art, comprised approximately 42%, 43% and 44% of total net sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, accent décor, which generally consists of artificial flowers and trees, kitchen, bath, bedding, candles, garden and outdoor décor, holiday accessories, home organization, pillows, pottery, vases and window treatments, comprised approximately 53%, 53% and 52% of total net sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our superstore format and unique approach to merchandising result in our ability to offer multiple styles, colors and design elements most other retailers are unable to carry.
​
Department reinventions are executed throughout the fiscal year to ensure our product is refreshed and relevant to our customers. During fiscal year 2021, we reinvented product within several departments, including bedding, bath, holiday accessories, vases and candles. Additionally, our collaborations, which are multi-year rotating partnerships with brands and designers, provide an additional avenue to bring in a variety of seasons and styles within our product mix. During fiscal year 2021, these collaborations included partnerships with Grace Mitchell and FAO Schwarz.
​
Sourcing
​
We believe our sourcing model provides us with significant flexibility to control our product costs. We work very closely with over 500 vendors (which we refer to as our “product partners”) to value engineer products at price points that deliver excellent value to our customers. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 35% of our merchandise was purchased from domestic product partners and 65% was purchased from foreign product partners in countries such as China, Vietnam, India, Turkey, Mexico and Hong Kong. We focused on improving supplier country diversification in fiscal year 2021 by sourcing additional product from various countries to mitigate the impact of certain high-tariff goods from China. In addition, a majority of our domestic product partners purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. Lead times vary depending on the product, ranging from three weeks to nine months.
​
In fiscal year 2018, we established a direct sourcing function to allow us to continue to increase our direct purchases from overseas factories, although we continue to purchase a substantial majority of products through domestic agents or trading companies. We believe direct sourcing represents an opportunity to increase our access to unique and quality products and give us greater control and visibility on product development, while reducing our product costs and improving item-level product margins.
​
We seek to build long-term relationships with our product partners, who can provide support for our various marketing and in-store merchandising initiatives. However, we believe we are not dependent on any one product partners and have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements. For many of our product partners, we are their fastest growing and, sometimes, largest account, which promotes collaboration between our companies. In fiscal year 2021, our top ten product partners accounted for approximately 20% of total purchases, with our largest product partner representing less than 5%. We believe our product partner relationships will continue to support our business growth.
​
Our manufacturing and transportation supply chains were, and may continue to be, subject to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been, and may continue to be, impacted by factory closures, port closures, equipment shortages, longshoremen availability and the inability or delay of our product partners to produce and ship products. In addition, our supply chain may be subject to financial risks as raw material producers and manufacturers experience financial hardships, closures or the inability to attract a labor force. While production of certain of our product categories is concentrated in certain regions that may be particularly impacted by local political, economic, social or environmental conditions, including COVID-19, our broader production base is diversified across regions with opportunities to make strategic shifts as business conditions allow.

Our Stores and Our Omnichannel Offering
​
Our stores continue to be the center of our customer offering. As of January 30, 2021, our store base was comprised of 219 stores in 40 states across the United States. A summary of our store locations by state as of January 30, 2021 is included in “Item 2. Properties”. We are committed to providing our customers with a seamless shopping experience whether they are shopping online or in our stores and, in fiscal year 2021, we accelerated our omnichannel capabilities in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
​
Store Operations and Layout
​
Our stores vary in size between 75,000 and 165,000 square feet with an average of approximately 105,000 square feet. Our locations have a similar store layout that is specifically designed to engage our customers. We design our stores as shoppable warehouses with wide aisles, an interior race track and clear signage that enable customers to easily navigate the store. We also have store maps available at the entrances and on shopping carts for our customer to use while she shops. Throughout our stores, we merchandise products logically by color, design and size in order to appeal to our core shopper’s buying preferences and use feature tables and end caps to create continuous visual interest and to highlight value. Additionally, we utilize product vignettes that offer design inspiration and coordinated product ideas to our customers. Our large store format allows us to maintain high in-stock positions and sell larger-sized and fully assembled products. To make her shopping experience easier and support our efficient operating model, we install fixture shelves lower to the ground so that products are easily reachable and require minimal staff assistance. We also utilize special fixtures for our products such as wall art, mirrors and rugs to allow easy viewing, improved shopability and minimized product damage. We have a centralized checkout lane with multiple registers that makes the checkout process simple and efficient.
​
We centralize major decisions relating to merchandising, inventory and pricing in order to allow our in-store team to focus on creating a clean and organized shopping environment. Our stores are typically led by a Store Director, a Store Manager and an Inventory Control Manager with a general staff averaging 30 employees, which fluctuates seasonally with business demands. Store employees are broadly split into two functional groups, customer service and operations, thereby allowing us to maximize efficiencies while aligning employees to the function that best suits their skills. Our proprietary labor model optimizes staffing levels based on hourly sales and traffic volumes. Additionally, employees utilize downtime to stock shelves and displays with new inventory. This model provides us with the flexibility to meet various seasonal demands while enabling consistent labor margins throughout the year. Our stores are managed company-wide by our VP of Stores, three Regional Managers and twenty-one District Managers.
​
Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store, Curbside Pick-up and Local Delivery
​
We are expanding into more ways for the customer to conveniently shop At Home. In fiscal year 2020, we piloted BOPIS in 28 stores. In fiscal year 2021, we substantially increased our BOPIS capabilities as well as introduced curbside pick-up and local delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, BOPIS and curbside pick-up are available in all of our stores and local delivery is available from nearly 75% of our stores.
​
Our local delivery is provided through our partnership with PICKUP, a last-mile logistics service. Through that partnership, At Home provides customers the option of contactless local home delivery starting at $10 within a 30 mile radius of participating stores. Deliveries typically occur same-day, but next-day service is also available. PICKUP has experience in several markets with many major retailers. Nonetheless, deliveries from our stores follow completion of the sales transaction with our customer, thus minimizing exposure we might have in connection with the delivery.
​
Our Industry
​
We compete in the large, growing and highly fragmented home furnishings and décor market.
​
Unlike other big box retail categories (e.g., office supplies, home improvement and electronics) where the top retailers hold a significant share of the overall market, the top three retailers in the home décor and furnishings category make up less than 25% of the market share. We believe we are uniquely positioned in the market, focused on providing 

5



the broadest assortment of home décor products at everyday low prices. In addition, the size of our stores enables us to carry a broad offering of fully assembled, larger merchandise, unlike many of our competitors, who are space constrained from providing a similar offering. We believe our focus on a broad assortment at value price points also positions us well within a fragmented market while also supporting our customer’s passion about, and love for, decorating her home.
​
The home furnishings and décor market includes a diverse set of categories and retail formats. However, we believe that we do not have a direct competitor, as no brick and mortar retailer matches our size, scale or scope of the everyday and seasonal product assortment that we offer at everyday low prices. Online home décor retailers offer a broad selection of products in home furnishings and décor that is typically weighted toward more expensive items. Conversely, we focus primarily on the attractive decorative accents and accessories portion of the market, generating an average basket of approximately $75, where we can employ our efficient operating model to generate attractive economics. Other online retailers may offer home décor products, but we believe we are able to offer a comparable breadth of product assortment and frequently lower prices. With our expanding omnichannel capabilities, selection, value, quality and uniqueness we believe we offer a unique value proposition.
​
Real Estate Strategy
​
Expansion Opportunities
​
Our retail concept has been successful across a number of geographic markets spanning populations of approximately 150,000 to over nineteen million people. Our new stores that have been opened over the past three completed fiscal years have delivered first year annualized sales of approximately $6.2 million for new store sites which are leased or purchased and approximately $7.9 million for new build stores across both existing and new markets. Over the past three completed fiscal years, we have opened 77 new stores in a mix of existing and new markets. Our recent store growth is summarized in the following table:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------------+---+-------------------+---+------------------+---+-----------------
​ | ​ | Fiscal Year Ended
​ | ​ | January 26, 2019 | ​ | January 25, 2020 | ​ | January 30, 2021
Beginning of period | ​ | 149 | ​ | 180 | ​ | 212 
Openings | ​ | 34 | ​ | 36 | ​ | 7 
Relocations | ​ | (2) | ​ | (3) | ​ | — 
Closures | ​ | (1) | ​ | (1) | ​ | — 
Total stores at end of period | ​ | 180 | ​ | 212 | ​ | 219 

​
We believe there is a significant whitespace opportunity to expand in both existing and new markets in the United States. Based on our internal analysis and research conducted for us by Buxton, we believe that we have the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the United States over the long term, or approximately three times our footprint of 219 stores as of January 30, 2021. The rate of future growth in any particular period is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe to reach this potential. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we suspended all new store openings and remodeling projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic but continued with the opening of seven new stores that were at or near completion. During fiscal year 2022, we have opened seven new stores to date and expect to open a total of 15 net new stores during the fiscal year, while also refreshing, remodeling or relocating a portion of our existing store base. We prefer to open new stores during the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate our future store opening plans, but we currently intend to grow our store base at a rate of approximately 10% beginning in fiscal year 2023. We believe our distribution centers collectively should be able to support at least 350 stores. We expect to continue to be disciplined in our approach to opening new stores, focusing on expanding our presence in existing markets while minimizing the risk of competition between new and existing stores as well as entering adjacent geographies. We also plan to act on compelling opportunities we identify in new markets.
​
We have opened stores in a mix of existing and new markets. New stores in existing markets have increased our total market share due to higher brand awareness. We believe there is still opportunity to continue adding locations in even our most established markets. In addition, we anticipate a limited number of relocations and remodels periodically as we evaluate our position in the market upon the impending expiration of lease terms. We have demonstrated our 

6



ability to open stores successfully in a diverse range of new markets across the country. Our portable concept has delivered consistent store economics across all markets, from smaller, less dense locations to larger, more heavily populated metropolitan areas.
​
Our store growth has historically been supported by new store economics that we believe are compelling. Over the past three fiscal years, our new stores have generated an average of $6.5 million of net sales within the first full year of operations and reached maturity within the first six months. Our new store model combines high average unit volumes and high margins with low net capital investment and occupancy costs, resulting in cash flow generation early in the life of a store. On average, over the past three fiscal years, our new store sites which are leased or purchased require approximately $5 million to $6 million of net investment and our new build stores require approximately $2 million to $3 million of net investment (net of sale leaseback proceeds). We have delivered an average payback period of approximately two and a half years for our new leased and purchased stores and approximately one and a half years for our new build stores. For fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, 100%, 83% and 74% of our new stores, respectively, have been leased at the time of opening.
​
Site Selection, Development and Financing
​
We have a flexible and balanced approach to site development that allows us to optimize the investment characteristics of each new store and maintain our robust new store pipeline. We can lease a second generation property, purchase a second generation building or build a new location from the ground up, although our real estate strategy is focused on redeveloping second generation big box retail locations depending on availability. We have developed a highly analytical approach to real estate site selection with a stringent new store approval process. Our dedicated real estate team spends considerable time evaluating prospective sites before submitting a comprehensive approval package to our real estate committee, which is primarily comprised of Officers. We target markets that meet our specific demographic and site evaluation criteria and complete substantial research before opening a new site. We use a proprietary model which takes into account several demand factors including population density of our target customer, median household income, home ownership rates, retail adjacencies, competitor presence, presence of existing At Home locations and local economic growth metrics. Primary site evaluation criteria include availability of attractive lease terms, sufficient box size, co-tenancy, convenient parking, traffic patterns, visibility and access from major roadways. We typically favor locations near other big box retailers that drive strong customer traffic to the area.
​
We believe there will continue to be an ample supply of large format real estate in the United States that is attractive to us, driven by multi-chain, national retailers relocating or closing stores, a number of retailers shifting to smaller locations and the relative lack of new retail concepts using larger store formats. We believe we are one of the only growing, large format retailers in the country. As a result, we have become a direct beneficiary of this available real estate and of various retailers looking to quickly shed stores. We typically offer a convenient solution to any selling or leasing party as we are able to take a wide variety of existing store spaces, move quickly and require little investment in time, resources or capital on their part. We take a disciplined approach to how we enter and build out our presence in markets and seek to optimize sales in a deliberate, carefully planned manner. In order to act quickly on new opportunities, we have used our proprietary site selection model to assess over 20,000 big box retail locations in the United States. As a result of our proven track record, we have developed strong relationships with brokers, landlords and big box retailers and are often the first to receive a call when locations become available.
​
For purchased properties or new development builds, we can extract capital using sale-leasebacks through a proven and disciplined approach. We have relationships with a number of the major real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), many of which have demonstrated interest in our portfolio of assets. We have completed six sale-leaseback transactions generating approximately $309 million in gross proceeds in the past three fiscal years.
​
Marketing
​
Given the relative newness and limited awareness of the At Home brand in certain markets, we believe there is still a significant opportunity to grow our brand and build awareness in both existing and new markets. Our marketing and advertising strategies seek to effectively and efficiently communicate our compelling value proposition to an increasing base of home décor enthusiasts. Our goal is to build deeper connections with our core customers, while 

7



attracting new customers to the At Home brand. We increased spend from nearly zero in fiscal year 2013 to approximately 3.1% of net sales in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 3.3% of net sales in fiscal year 2020. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our efforts to curtail marketing spend in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2021 as well as our significant top-line outperformance, our marketing spend was approximately 2.5% of net sales in fiscal year 2021.We intend to continue to allocate marketing spend to both traditional and digital media to increase awareness of our differentiated value proposition among specialty home décor retail and to drive both new and existing customers to our stores.
​
The home décor enthusiast views her home as a place that is constantly evolving with each season as well as everyday events in her life. At Home’s mission is to offer her the biggest selection of styles at the best prices every day, giving her endless possibilities and the confidence that she will find the perfect products at the perfect price every time she shops. We engage with her across various marketing channels before, during and after her store visit. We have built relationships with home décor influencers, leveraging Facebook and Instagram. We use email and text message marketing to inspire her with seasonally relevant décor and will be growing the reach of these efforts as we focus on continuing to expand our base of over 9.0 million Insider Perks loyalty program customers, which has increased approximately 40% since January 25, 2020. 
​
We also use traditional and digital media platforms (such as paid digital, outdoor, direct mail, paid search and social media) to build broader brand awareness and to drive traffic to our website and our stores. To launch our brand during new store openings, we have evolved our strategy through tactical testing to get to an effective and cost efficient mix of media, including outdoor, direct mail and social media.
​
Through customer communications across various channels, including email, website, paid media, social and influencer programs, we are able to share new product launches, highlight key categories and provide our customers with décor ideas and inspiration. We launched our Insider Perks program in the second half of fiscal year 2018, and added new tiers and more benefits in fiscal year 2021. Members receive special discounted pricing on specific items, an annual birthday offer, hassle-free receiptless returns, an extra 30-day extended return window and advanced notice of new events and deals. Our new Insider Perks tiers include a new VIP tier and a new Design Professional tier called BOSS. In fiscal year 2021, we also reissued the At Home branded credit card through Synchrony Bank that includes loyalty incentives for our Insider Perks members. This program launched during fiscal year 2018 and allows At Home cardholders to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, loyalty rewards and other cardholder exclusive benefits.
​
Distribution
​
We operate a 592,000 square foot distribution center in Plano, Texas, which also serves as our corporate headquarters. We have invested in automating our Plano, Texas facility, implementing warehouse management software and robotics to efficiently handle daily product deliveries. At the beginning of fiscal year 2020, we opened our 800,000 square foot second distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, which required an additional incremental capital investment of $2.0 million, $5.5 million and $13.0 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe our two distribution centers collectively should be able to support at least 350 stores. We also have an additional 555,000 square foot warehouse in Garland, Texas, for initial inventory build-up for new store openings.
​
The vast majority of our current products are shipped directly to our distribution centers, which serve as cross-dock facilities, storing very limited inventory on site. In order to streamline store operations and reduce labor requirements, all of the merchandise in our distribution centers is prepared for the sales floor prior to transport. We generally ship merchandise to our stores between one and five times a week, depending on the season and the volume of a specific store, utilizing contract carriers for all shipments.
​
Seasonality
​
Our business has historically been moderately seasonal, with a meaningful portion of our sales dedicated to seasonal and holiday merchandise, resulting in the realization of higher portions of net sales and operating income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to the importance of our peak sales periods, which include the spring and year-end 

8



holiday decorating seasons, the second and fourth fiscal quarters have historically contributed, and are expected to continue to contribute, significantly to our operating results for the entire fiscal year. In anticipation of seasonal increases in sales activity during these periods, we incur significant additional expense prior to and during our peak seasonal periods, which we may finance with additional short-term borrowings. These expenses may include the acquisition of additional inventory, seasonal staffing needs and other similar items.
​
Information Systems
​
We believe that our management information systems will support our growth and enhance our competitive position. Our efficient operating model is supported by using industry standard applications in the areas of merchandising, store systems, replenishment, distribution and financial systems. We use a combination of these industry standard systems along with automated and easy to use proprietary systems to support all areas of our business. Over the past seven fiscal years, we have invested in IT systems and infrastructure, including investments in merchandising, planning and allocation (JDA), POS systems (IBM/Toshiba), distribution center (PKMS), order management (KIBO), e-commerce (SalesForce), relating to our BOPIS program, and finance and accounting (SAP) to ensure our systems are robust and scalable. Additionally, over the past seven fiscal years we have invested in data centers and additional IT team members to provide appropriate support and project delivery capabilities needed for our growth.
​
Human Capital Management
​
We live our values every day: to be creative; to work together; to be smart and scrappy; to do the right thing; and to have fun. Our values underlie our vision to become the leading home décor retailer and our mission to enable everyone to affordably make their house a home. Attracting, developing and retaining the best people is critical to achieving our mission and vision and to driving our culture and long-term success. We invest in our employees and promote a culture of leadership, open communication, inclusiveness, creativity and accountability. Our employee training and policies, including our Code of Business Principles, support our culture, vision and mission.
​
Our management is responsible for shaping our culture, including setting the right tone-at-the-top and ensuring our policies and processes reflect and reinforce our values. The Board and Board committees provide leadership and oversight regarding, among other things, compensation and benefit programs, culture, compliance, key employee succession planning, and employee health and safety.
​
Employees
​
As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 7,692 employees, including 7,028 store employees and 664 other employees across the corporate and distribution center functions in the United States. Of the 7,028 store employees, 691 were full-time salaried staff and the remaining employees consisted of a mix of full-time and part-time hourly workers. None of our employees are currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements.
​
Talent Development and Retention 
​
Our employees are a critical component of our success, and we prioritize attracting, retaining and promoting top talent both in our stores and in our corporate structure. We provide our field and corporate leaders with the right tools and support to run the organization effectively. We recognize and reward employees who meet our high-performance standards, and we work to ensure our employees have opportunities for advancement and career growth. All employees are eligible to participate in our bonus incentive program.
​
At Home offers meaningful training and development opportunities. Most field employees begin their workday with short online educational training courses through our software learning platform. We also typically host a three-day annual leadership conference that brings together our field and corporate leadership with the goal of collaborative learning and building our At Home community. 
​

Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
​
Our commitment to diversity begins at the top, with a diverse Board and executive leadership team. As of January 30, 2021, our corporate leadership team consists of 13 out of 29 or 45% female officers. At Home strives to build a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace for all employees. Our corporate culture, priorities and policies reflect our commitment to equality and contribute to driving strong performance. Our field teams intentionally tend to reflect the diversity of our customers and the communities where we operate. 
​
Employee Benefits, Health and Safety
​
              In response to the pandemic, we introduced new tools for communication and increased the regularity of widespread employee communication. We transitioned the frequency of our town hall meetings to be monthly rather than quarterly; we hosted executive listening sessions; we relaunched our monthly CEO small group sessions; and we introduced executive-sponsored employee engagement groups. Our executive leadership team and our internal communication team work together to share ongoing communications with our employees that address issues of interest and importance, with the most notable issues in fiscal year 2021 revolving around the pandemic. The importance we put on communication reinforces employee engagement, reminds our people of available resources, and promotes our At Home values and culture. 
​
We want our employees to thrive within and outside of their working environment. We provide a market competitive total rewards and benefits package to address the current needs of our employees, including their comprehensive health, financial wellness, quality of life coverage and childcare support. We also offer resources and events that support the physical, mental and financial health and well-being of our employees, including our annual corporate Wellness Week and our safety training programs to prevent workplace accidents and injuries. We are proud to have created the At Home Foundation to provide financial assistance to eligible employees facing unforeseen hardship, including as a result of COVID-19. The At Home Foundation relies primarily on donations from employees in order to fund grants. 
​
We prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. In response to the pandemic, we introduced numerous operational changes and protocols aimed at ensuring the health and safety of every individual in our stores. We are somewhat unique in that our large format stores offer space and wide aisles for social distancing. In addition to our store protocols, our corporate employees who are able to work remotely have been given the flexibility to continue doing so. And our Safe Home Office Policy ensures our corporate home office is safe, clean and available for employees who need or choose to use it.
