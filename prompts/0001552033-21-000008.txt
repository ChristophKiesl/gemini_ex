ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Overview 
TransUnion is a leading global information and insights company that strives to make trust possible between businesses and consumers, working to ensure that each person is reliably and safely represented in the marketplace. At TransUnion, we find innovative ways to leverage data and information to help businesses and consumers transact with confidence and achieve great things. We call this Information for Good.
Grounded in our legacy as a credit reporting agency, we have built a robust and accurate database of information for a large portion of the adult population in the markets we serve. We use our data fusion methodology to link and match an increasing set of other disparate data to further enrich our database. We use this enriched data, combined with our expertise, to continuously develop more powerful and useful solutions for our customers, all in accordance with global laws and regulations. Because of our work, organizations can better understand consumers in order to make more informed decisions, and earn consumer trust through great, personalized experiences, and the proactive extension of the right opportunities, tools and offers. In turn, we believe consumers can be confident that their data identities will result in the opportunities they deserve.
We provide consumer reports, actionable insights and analytics such as credit and other scores, and technology solutions to businesses. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, which we also refer to as verticals, including Financial Services, Healthcare, Insurance and other markets we serve. We have a global presence in over 30 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific. 
Our addressable market includes the data and analytics market, which continues to grow as companies around the world recognize the benefits of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are made based on data and insights, and as consumers recognize the importance that data and analytics play in their ability to procure goods and services and protect their identities. There are several underlying trends supporting this market growth, including the creation of large amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that enable data to be processed more quickly and efficiently to provide business insights, and growing demand for these business insights across industries and geographies. Leveraging our more than 50 year operating history and our established position as a leading provider of information and insights, we have advanced our business by investing in a number of strategic initiatives such as evolving our technology infrastructure to leverage both internal and external capabilities as appropriate to best serve our customers, expanding the breadth and depth of our data, strengthening our analytics capabilities and enhancing our business processes. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to expand our share within the markets we currently serve and capitalize on the larger data and analytics opportunity.
Our solutions are based on a foundation of financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, healthcare, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information obtained from thousands of sources including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our technology infrastructure allows us to efficiently integrate our data with our analytics and technology capabilities to create and deliver innovative solutions to our customers and to quickly adapt to changing customer needs. Our deep analytics resources, including our people and tools driving predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enable us to provide businesses and consumers with better insights into their data. Our technology solutions capabilities, which are generally delivered on a software-as-a-service platform, allow businesses to interpret data and apply their specific qualifying criteria to make decisions and take actions. Collectively, our data, analytics and technology solutions capabilities allow businesses to authenticate the identity of consumers, effectively determine the most relevant products for consumers, retain and cross-sell to existing consumers, identify and acquire new consumers and reduce loss from fraud and data breaches. Similarly, our capabilities allow consumers to see how their credit profiles have changed over time, understand the impact of financial decisions on their credit scores, manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft.
We leverage our differentiated capabilities in order to serve a global customer base across multiple geographies and industry verticals. We offer our solutions to business customers in Financial Services, Healthcare, Insurance and other industries, and our customer base includes many of the largest companies in the industries we serve. We sell our solutions to leading consumer lending banks, credit card issuers, alternative lenders, auto insurance carriers, auto lenders, healthcare providers, and federal, state and local government agencies. We have been successful in leveraging our brand, our expertise and our solutions in our 
global operations and have a leading presence in several high-growth international markets. Millions of consumers across the globe also use our data to help manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft.
We believe we have an attractive business model that has highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, low capital requirements, significant operating leverage and strong and stable cash flows. The proprietary and embedded nature of our solutions and the integral role that we play in our customers’ decision-making processes have historically translated into high customer retention and revenue visibility. We continue to demonstrate organic growth by increasing our sales to existing customers, innovating new solutions and gaining new customers. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses across our segments, reducing our exposure to cyclical trends in any particular industry vertical or geography. We operate primarily on a contributory data model in which we typically obtain updated information including a growing set of public record and alternative data at little or no cost, as we develop new solutions and expand into new industries and geographies. We are evolving our hybrid public-private technology infrastructure to ensure that our systems remain highly secure, reliable, and performant by design. We are focused on processes and foundational technology that allows us to leverage demand-led consumption from public cloud providers and from our high performance privately owned infrastructure.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended extensive containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The pandemic has reached all of the regions in which we do business, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures attempting to contain and mitigate the effects of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, border closings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns, limitations or closures of non-essential businesses, school closures, social distancing requirements and various economic stimulus initiatives. While certain of these measures have been relaxed or reversed to varying degrees throughout the world, many have been subsequently reinstated and even tightened, adding an additional layer of uncertainty. In the fourth quarter of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccines were approved for use by various governments throughout the world, including in the United States. The vaccines have begun to be distributed and administered in the United States and various other regions where we operate, with varying degrees of success. The ultimate success of these efforts will also be impacted by vaccine manufacturers’ ability to successfully produce and effectively distribute adequate doses of the vaccine in a timely manner, the availability of a sufficient number of healthcare workers to administer the vaccines, as well as the public’s perception of the safety of the vaccines and their willingness to receive them, among others. 
The global spread of COVID-19 and actions taken in response to the virus continue to negatively affect workforces, customers, consumer confidence, financial markets, employment rates, consumer spending, credit markets and housing demand, cause significant economic, business and social disruptions, volatility and financial uncertainty, and have led to a significant economic downturn, including in the markets where we operate. Businesses and consumers continue to react and adapt to the uncertainty with varying degrees of success in the markets where we operate. Since mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread measures implemented to contain its effects, and business and consumer responses to such measures, have had a material and adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, including customer demand for our services and solutions in all of our segments. While we have seen signs of increased demand for our services in the markets where we operate since the low point in April 2020, including ongoing improvements through the fourth quarter of 2020, the impact of COVID-19, including government measures and business and consumer responses to such measures, may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results for an uncertain period of time.
In the face of these challenges, our primary focus has been and continues to be the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. We quickly and effectively moved to a work-from-home model in the early days of the pandemic in every market we serve, and continue to adhere to that model. This has allowed us to protect our associates and the broader population while continuing to operate our businesses and provide services and solutions to customers and consumers. We remain focused on ensuring impacted consumers are aware of resources and relief available to them, and we are working with trade associations and industry peers to facilitate access to resources and educational materials aimed at consumers.
During this challenging period, our total revenues increased from $2.656 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.717 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year increase of 2.3%. Our Net Income attributable to TransUnion decreased from $346.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, to $343.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year decrease of 1.1%. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $1,058.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1,044.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing a year-over-year decrease of 1.3%. As of December 31, 2020, the book value of our debt was $3.454 billion. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Key Performance Measures,” for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation to net income attributable to TransUnion.
Our Evolution 
We are dedicated to evolving our legacy as a global information and insights company that makes trust possible, so businesses and consumers can transact with confidence and achieve great things. Our business has over 50 years of operating history and a 
long track record of providing information and insights to businesses and consumers while continuing to innovate to meet their changing needs. Since our founding as a provider of regional credit reporting services, we have built a comprehensive, valuable, and unique database of U.S. consumers to build solutions that span many industry verticals and customer processes. We expanded our operations by targeting new customers, industry verticals and geographies and also entered the consumer solutions space. We have strengthened our analytics and technology solutions capabilities and acquired complementary datasets and technologies enabling us to enhance our solutions, diversify our revenue base and expand into other verticals, such as Healthcare, Media and Insurance. We continue to grow our global presence, creating and acquiring credit reporting agencies in new geographies and establishing strong international footholds to expand into other emerging markets. We also expanded the reach of our consumer solutions by partnering with other market leaders and innovators.
As part of our continued evolution, we have invested in a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will allow us to cater to the growing demand for data and analytics, provide differentiated solutions and better serve our customers. These initiatives include:
•Investing in our Technology:    Technology is at the core of the solutions we provide to our customers. We continue to make significant investments to evolve our technology infrastructure by leveraging both internal and external resources. We also leverage the latest data and analytics technologies which enable us to be quicker, more efficient and more cost-effective. Our significant ongoing investments allow us to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, improve delivery speeds, provide better availability, strengthen product development capabilities and continue to invest in information security on the basis of risk, while lowering our overall cost structure. Our technology allows us to build capabilities and leverage them across multiple geographies and industry verticals.
•Expanding our Data:    We continue to invest in the breadth and depth of our data. We introduced the concept of trended data to provide the trajectory of a consumer’s risk profile, used public records data to enhance the scope of business issues we can address, incorporated alternative data into our databases to allow for a more comprehensive risk assessment of banked and unbanked consumers, and have made several recent acquisitions in our Media vertical to add yet another dimension to our ability to match data in a digital world. We believe we are the largest provider in the United States of both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data. We continue to improve the quality of our data, provide deeper insights into risk and create differentiated solutions for our customers.
•Strengthening our Analytics Capabilities:    We have strengthened our analytics capabilities by leveraging modern technology and differentiated data assets, strategic acquisitions, utilizing more advanced tools and growing our analytics team. This has allowed us to create solutions that produce greater insights and more predictive results, which help our customers make better decisions. Our strengthened analytics capabilities have also shortened our time-to-market to create and deliver these solutions to our customers.
•Broadening our Target Markets:    We have grown our target markets by establishing a presence in attractive high-growth and strategic international markets such as the United Kingdom, India, Colombia and the Philippines. We have also established and grown our presence in diversified verticals such as Healthcare, Insurance, Public Sector, and Media, as well as expanded the reach of our consumer offerings by partnering with traditional and emerging providers in new verticals. Our capabilities enable us to develop scalable products that we are able to deploy across new markets and verticals globally.
•Enhancing our Business Processes and Capabilities:    We continue to enhance our business processes and capabilities to support our growth. We have developed technology centers-of excellence, common tools and technologies, and redundancy and disaster recovery plans. We have hired additional industry experts, which has allowed us to create and sell new vertical-specific solutions that address our customers’ needs. Our global sales force structure includes dedicated teams for our largest customers, shared sales teams for our mid-sized customers, and call center support teams for our smaller customers, which increases our sales team’s effectiveness across our target markets.
We believe that our ongoing focus on evolving with the market and with our customers’ needs ensures continued improvement in our overall services to businesses and consumers. Leveraging our trusted brand, global scale and strong market position in the verticals we serve will allow us to capitalize on business opportunities worldwide and contribute to our long-term growth.
Our Market Opportunity 
We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term trend of businesses and consumers using data and analytics to make more informed decisions and manage risk more effectively. As worldwide spending on data and analytics increases, we believe there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment affecting the geographies and industry verticals we serve that will create increasing demand for our solutions:
•Rapid Growth in Data Creation and Application:    Larger and more diversified datasets are now assembled faster while the breadth of analytical applications and solutions has expanded. Companies are increasingly relying on 
business analytics and data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. Non-traditional sources of data have become important in deriving alternative metrics. The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices generates enormous amounts of data tied to consumers, activities and locations. We believe that the demand for targeted data and sophisticated analytical solutions will continue to grow meaningfully as businesses seek real-time access to more granular views of consumer populations and more holistic views on individual consumers.
•Advances in Technology and Analytics Unlocking the Value of Data:    Ongoing advances in data collection, storage and analytics technology have contributed to the greater use and value of data and analytics in decision making. As businesses have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data, they increasingly expect access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. We believe this has made sophisticated technology critical for gaining and retaining business in the risk and information services industry.
•Greater Adoption of Data Solutions Across New and Existing Industry Verticals:    With the proliferation of data, we believe companies across new and existing industry verticals recognize the value of risk information and analytical tools, particularly when tailored to their specific needs.
◦Financial Services Industry:    The combination of increased capital requirements, additional compliance costs and the overhang of legacy assets is pushing large segments of small-to-medium-sized business and consumer lenders out of the banking sector, resulting in the creation of new specialty finance companies, such as peer-to-peer lending platforms and online balance sheet lenders, which are actively filling the void. These technology-enabled lending platforms provide access to credit in a fast and efficient manner by utilizing sophisticated risk assessment tools that leverage data, such as behavioral data, transactional data and employment and credit information. At the same time, traditional financial services companies are also increasing the use of applications and data in order to address regulatory requirements, lower operating costs and better serve their customers.
◦Healthcare Industry:    Greater patient financial responsibility, focus on cost management and regulatory supervision are all driving healthcare providers to use data and related analytics tools to better manage their revenue cycle. For example, to reduce collection risks, healthcare providers seek information about their patients’ insurance coverage and ability to pay at the time of registration. Insurance discovery tools are increasingly being utilized to optimize accounts receivable management, maximize collections and minimize uncompensated care.
◦Insurance Industry:    As consumers increasingly obtain quotes from multiple insurers in an effort to lower their costs, insurers are trying to improve the accuracy of their risk assessments and initial quotes. For example, insurance carriers are using driver violation data to uncover offenses that will impact pricing earlier in the quoting process so consumers have a more accurate view of the premiums they will be charged.
◦Other Emerging Verticals: We also offer solutions in a diversified portfolio of other emerging verticals such as Media, Collections, Tenant and Employment, Public Sector, Diversified Markets and other verticals. Within the Media vertical, our highly accurate consumer data helps companies improve their marketing investments through solutions that provide more targeted audience segments to reach the right consumers across digital channels. In Collections, our solutions improve third party collectors’ bottom line and help provide a quality customer experience by delivering actionable consumer insights and services. Our Tenant and Employment business provides data and insights to make informed investment, hiring, and rental decisions. Our suite of solutions in the Public Sector gives government agencies the superior data assets, analytics, and security they need to manage compliance and boost services for the constituents they serve. We also offer data-driven solutions in other verticals that address the entire customer lifecycle in industries such as technology, retail and e-commerce, communications and energy, and services and screening.
•Increasing Lending Activity in Emerging International Markets:    As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked consumers. In addition, credit penetration is relatively low in emerging markets when compared to developed markets. For example, using our database of information compiled from financial institutions as a benchmark of credit activity, we estimate that approximately 30% of the adult population in India is currently credit active. Furthermore, the widespread adoption and use of mobile phones in emerging markets have enabled greater levels of financial inclusion and access to banking and credit. We expect the populations in emerging markets to continue to become more credit active, resulting in increased demand for our services.
•Increased Management and Monitoring of Personal Financial Information and Identity Protection by Consumers:    We expect demand for consumer solutions to continue to rise with greater consumer awareness of the 
importance and usage of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and increasingly available free credit information. The proliferation of mobile devices has also made data much more accessible, enabling consumers to manage their finances and monitor their information in real-time. We believe these trends will continue to drive growth for our consumer business.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Comprehensive and Unique Datasets
Our long operating history and thought leadership in the industry have allowed us to build comprehensive and unique data assets that would be difficult for a new market entrant to replicate. Our solutions are based on a foundation of financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, healthcare, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information obtained from thousands of sources including financial institutions, private databases, public records repositories, and other alternative data sources. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. We are constantly updating our data to keep it current, and we continue to identify opportunities to acquire additional data. We believe that our data is unique and differentiates us from our competitors. We own several proprietary datasets such as consumer credit information, driver violation history, healthcare eligibility information, business data and rental payment history. Our global data assets encompass alternative data, such as the voter registry in India, a vehicle information database in South Africa, and a mobile device database from our acquisition of iovation, Inc. (“iovation”). We have also acquired public record datasets, which are time consuming and difficult for others to obtain and associate with the correct person. We believe we are the largest provider of scale in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers.
Technology Infrastructure
While technology advances never cease, we continue to evolve our infrastructure and our capabilities to efficiently interface with our clients in the business ecosystems in which we participate. The need to further expand and evolve our enterprise approach to technology has become more significant as TransUnion has increasingly become a global company. Our technology infrastructure allows us to continually improve our overall services to businesses and consumers and ensures that we are well positioned to differentiate our datasets and capabilities. We believe our technology infrastructure capabilities have resulted in increased throughput, improved data matching, greater efficiency, advanced platform flexibility, better information security, and lower operating costs.
•Powerful Data Capabilities:    Our technology gives us the ability to process, organize and analyze high volumes of data across multiple operating systems, databases and file types as well as to deal with both structured and unstructured data that changes frequently. We process billions of transactions on a daily basis.
•Enhanced Linking and Matching:    Because our data matching technology is able to interrelate data across disparate sources, industries and time periods, we believe that we are able to create differentiated datasets and provide our customers with comprehensive insights that allow them to better evaluate risk. For example, our TLOxp solution leverages these data matching capabilities across various datasets to identify and investigate relationships among people, assets, locations and businesses, allowing us to offer enhanced due diligence, threat assessment, identity authentication and fraud prevention and detection solutions.
•Continuing Evolution of Our Hybrid Public-Private Cloud Infrastructure: At the beginning of 2020, we announced an initiative to further enhance our technology infrastructure through a three-year investment that we refer to as Project Rise. This investment is a continuing evolution of our hybrid public-private cloud infrastructure, a significant upgrade to our existing infrastructure. Project Rise is an initiative designed to ensure that our technology is even more effective, efficient, secure and reliable, which we believe will enable us to perform at our highest level across all of TransUnion. Our investment will be concentrated in streamlining processes, increasing automation, and rapidly adopting a hybrid public and private cloud approach globally. The benefits we expect to realize under Project Rise include:
◦refactoring and optimizing our applications into a more modern API-based and microservices-oriented architecture. 
◦simplifying the delivery of our intellectual property on a global basis, further increasing our speed-to-market. We will more easily push our intellectual property into the public cloud and then pull it down for use in a given market. This approach will help us continue our rapid international expansion and more effortlessly deploy solutions across our markets.
◦creating meaningful scaled economies around company-driven consumption of our infrastructure using cloud-based technology. We will consume and pay for only needed infrastructure as we develop new applications.
Using this infrastructure-as-code approach eliminates the time-consuming manual provisioning process and replaces it with auto-provisioning from either the private cloud or a public cloud provider. 
◦utilizing readily available innovative tools from cloud-service providers instead of developing them ourselves. This shift will enable faster product development through new compliance tools, model training, machine learning and other cutting-edge technologies. By employing more highly automated tools with auto-provisioning infrastructure, our developers will focus on value-added, revenue generating work, freeing them from traditional preparation and enablement activities. 
◦accessing the new public cloud business models. For example, public cloud providers have been building application and data marketplaces. This move will help ensure that no matter how data and applications are delivered to customers, whether through a public cloud marketplace or our own Prama DataHub, we will be able to participate.
Sophisticated and Flexible Analytics and Technology Solutions Capabilities

We consistently focus on innovation to develop new and enhanced solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe our specialized data, analytics and solution services and collaborative approach with our customers differentiate us from our competitors. Our solutions are often scalable across different customers, geographies and verticals. Several examples of our innovative and differentiated solutions include: 
•CreditVision:    We continue to enhance our credit data by including new data fields, enriching values in existing data fields and expanding account history. Our enhanced credit data has been combined with hundreds of algorithms to produce CreditVision and CreditVision Link, first to market and market-leading solutions that provide greater granularity and evaluate consumer behavior patterns over time. This results in a more predictive view of the consumer, increases the total population of consumers who can effectively be scored and helps consumers gain improved pricing.
•CreditVision Acute Relief Solution suite:  Today’s uncertain economic environment continues to impact consumer behavior and performance. Using FCRA-governed data, this newly released set of trended credit attributes and accompanying score provides a more precise view of consumers impacted by acute economic conditions, enabling more clarity to help our customers manage accounts appropriately. CreditVision Acute Relief Attributes help identify credit relationships and payment behaviors for consumers previously or currently in relief status during acute economic conditions, allowing support strategies to be adjusted if necessary. CreditVision Acute Relief Risk Score uses trended usage and payment data as strong leading indicators of risk, enhancing insights during acute situations.
•CreditView:    CreditView is an interactive dashboard that provides consumers with credit information and educational tools in a comprehensive, user-friendly format. Consumers are able to easily see how their credit profiles have changed over time, receive alerts on key credit changes, simulate the impact of financial decisions on their credit score, and see relevant offers for financial products.
•TLOxp:    TLOxp leverages our data matching capabilities across thousands of data sources to identify and investigate relationships among specific people, assets, locations and businesses. This allows us to offer enhanced due diligence, threat assessment, identity authentication and fraud prevention and detection solutions, and to expand our solutions into new verticals such as government and law enforcement.
•DriverRisk: Leveraging our driver violation database, we developed DriverRisk, a data and analytic solution that helps auto insurance carriers cost effectively validate driving records and assess risk during the underwriting and renewal process to improve returns.
•Insurance Discovery Solutions:    Our robust insurance discovery platform helps identify incomplete, inaccurate, or missing patient data to find maximum coverage for our healthcare customers.

•Audience Segmentation: Our technology platform leverages data science and machine learning technology to quickly model, build, and distribute custom audiences based on our customer’s criteria. The platform quickly translates multiple data points into insights and effective audiences, which leads to higher return on advertising spend in digital marketing channels. 
•TransUnion Seamless Onboarding:  Customers in many emerging markets often lack an effective seamless online onboarding tool. As COVID-19 reduced or eliminated in-person interaction, we created a digital onboarding solutions package that bundles our robust suite of pre-fill, ID verification, credit solutions tools. We deliver this solution to our customers via a single API, customized to their needs. Customers can deploy this digital onboarding solution as a mobile app, mobile website or as a white label tool built into their own platforms. We quickly launched this solution in India, South Africa, Colombia and the Philippines, creating a multi-million dollar business in less than a year, and are looking to leverage this success to build solutions in our developed markets. 
 Deep and Specialized Industry Expertise
We have deep expertise in a number of attractive industry verticals including Financial Services, Healthcare and Insurance. Our expertise has allowed us to develop sophisticated vertical-specific solutions within these targeted industries that play an integral role in our customers’ decision-making processes and are often embedded into their workflows. Our team includes industry experts with significant experience in the verticals that we target and relationships with leading companies in those verticals. We also have regulatory compliance expertise across the industries that we serve. Together, this expertise provides us with a comprehensive understanding of business trends and insights for customers in these verticals, allowing us to build solutions that cater to these customers’ specific requirements. We have been able to apply our industry knowledge, data assets, technology and analytics capabilities to develop new solutions and revenue opportunities within key verticals. For example, in Financial Services, our differentiated position allowed us to anticipate the increased demand from alternative consumer lending providers such as peer-to-peer lending platforms, so we created solutions that catered to these emerging providers. In Insurance, we partnered with a vehicle history data provider to launch a vehicle history score that helps insurance carriers further segment risk based on the attributes of a specific automobile. In Healthcare, we developed a solution that allows healthcare providers to search for additional health insurance coverage and recover additional uncompensated care costs.
Leading Presence in Attractive International Markets
We have been operating internationally for over 30 years and have strong global brand recognition. We have strategically targeted attractive international markets in both developed and emerging economies and have a diversified global presence, including a strong presence in Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, India, and Asia Pacific. Local senior management in our International markets provide us with deeper insights into these markets and stronger relationships with our customers. We have leveraged our brand, operating history, global footprint and technology infrastructure to establish new credit bureaus in several international markets, such as Canada in 1989, India in 2001 and the Philippines in 2011. Once we establish a foothold in a region, our model is to expand the services we offer within these markets and then move into adjacent emerging markets. For example, we have used our operations in Hong Kong to expand into other Asia Pacific countries and provide analytic scoring models in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. We have used our operations in South Africa to expand into neighboring African countries. We have also entered new markets through strategic acquisitions, including the United Kingdom in 2018, Colombia in 2016, and Brazil in 2011.
Proven and Experienced Management Team
Our senior management team has a proven track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve, with an average of over twenty years of industry experience. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent for our businesses. Our team has deep knowledge of the data and analytics sector and expertise across the various industries that we serve. Our team has overseen our expansion into new industries and geographies, while managing ongoing strategic 
initiatives including our significant technology investments. As a result of the sustained focus of our management team, we have been successful in consistently driving growth, both organically and through acquiring and integrating businesses.
Our Growth Strategy 
Enhance Underlying Data, Technology and Analytics Capabilities to Develop Innovative Solutions
As the demand for data and analytics solutions grows across industries and geographies, we will continue to expand the scope of our underlying data, improve our tools and technology and enhance our analytics and technology solutions capabilities to provide innovative solutions that address this demand. As the needs of businesses and consumers continue to evolve, we continue to help them meet their challenges, which our ongoing investments in data, technology and analytics enable us to do more quickly and efficiently. With our insights and information, our customers can explore connections between people, businesses, assets and locations; identify assets, uncover inconsistencies and identify misrepresentations; and uncover evidence of financial distress. 
Our continuous technology investments have also reduced the time to market for new solutions, which allow us to react quickly to customer requirements. In addition, these investments also improve efficiency, reliability, security, and performance. We also continue to take advantage of strategic partnerships that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, by leveraging our fast, available, and secure technology infrastructure and working together with one of our strategic partners we were able to provide real-time credit decisions in a matter of seconds, enabling the use of a new virtual credit card through consumers’ digital wallets.
Further Penetrate Existing Industry Verticals with Current and New Solutions
We are a leading provider of risk and information solutions in several industry verticals today, including Financial Services, Healthcare and Insurance. We believe there is significant opportunity for further growth within these industries by expanding the number of customers to whom we sell our current solutions as well as by creating innovative new solutions that we can use to grow our presence in these industries. We focus on developing new solutions that address evolving customer needs within our industry verticals. In the Financial Services vertical, we launched Prama, a self-service, visual platform that enables access to massive anonymized data sets for benchmarking and attribute development. We also developed CreditVision, which provides customers with a time-based risk trend and increases the total eligible population of consumers. Similarly, in Insurance, we introduced the DriverRisk solution that leverages our driver violation database to cost effectively identify drivers with ratable violations, resulting in unique insights into driver risk, reduced costs, and higher returns for insurance carriers. In order to more effectively address these opportunities, we have redeployed and reallocated our sales resources to focus either on new customer opportunities or on selling additional services and solutions to existing customers. With our leading market positions, existing strong relationships in Financial Services, Healthcare and Insurance verticals, and with our consumer partners, we believe we have the opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base and capture a strong proportion of their spending across the consumer lifecycle.
Establish Positions in New, Adjacent Industry Verticals
In addition to increasing penetration in industries where we have a substantial presence, we continue to create solutions that address customer needs in attractive new industries. Our strategy is to develop new solutions for a specific application, industry, or geography, and then deploy these solutions to other markets where they may be applicable. We believe that our capabilities allow us to quickly create and deliver solutions to new industries and geographies where information-based analytics and technology solutions capabilities are currently underutilized. For example, our strong position in Financial Services and Insurance verticals has allowed us to establish a presence in the Healthcare vertical to capitalize on the increasing demand for data and analytics solutions. Combining our in-house expertise with recent acquisitions, we have created a comprehensive suite of holistic front-end and back-end solutions in the healthcare revenue cycle management industry. We have created innovative solutions that help engage patients early, ensure earned revenue is paid and optimize payment strategies. We continue to target other verticals such as Public Sector, Tenant and Employment, and Media, where we see opportunities to leverage our existing data, analytics and technology solutions capabilities.
Expand our Presence in Attractive International Markets
We believe international markets present a significant opportunity for growth. We have significant scale in some of the world’s fastest growing markets, such as India and Latin America, which positions us to take advantage of the favorable dynamics in these regions as their populations become more credit active. We leverage solutions developed in the United States and deploy them to international markets, after localizing them to individual market requirements. For example, after launching CreditVision in the United States, we have expanded our offerings with similar solutions globally. In markets where we have established a presence in a particular vertical, we will expand further into adjacent verticals, such as Insurance and Consumer Solutions. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by forming alliances with financial services institutions, industry associations and other local partners, and by pursuing strategic acquisitions. Across all our international 
expansion initiatives, we will continue to leverage our technology infrastructure to drive speed to market, scale and differentiation.
Broaden Our Reach in Consumer Market through Direct and Indirect Channels
Our consumer business continues to deliver growth with strong margins, driven by our innovative solutions and flexible and collaborative partnership model that has expanded the market for consumer services, along with greater consumer awareness of the value of their credit information and increased risk of identity theft. Our strategy is to grow our own member base in the direct channel as well as expand our reach through partnerships in the indirect channel. Across both channels, our focus is on delivering value-added solutions and features while continuing to improve the consumer experience with more user-friendly interfaces and better customer service and educational tools. Within our indirect channel, we will continue to leverage and enhance our flexible technology platform to expand our relationship with existing partners as well as develop relationships with new partners and enter new verticals. We believe that partnerships not only enable us to grow our own business, but also expand the overall market and provide us access to new consumer segments. We will also continue to leverage our approach in the U.S. consumer market to expand our consumer operations globally.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
We will continue to pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth within our existing businesses and diversify into new businesses. We are focused primarily on opportunities that expand our geographic footprint, increase the breadth and depth of our datasets, enhance our services, provide us with industry expertise in our key verticals and deepen our presence in our international markets.
We have expanded our geographic footprint in new countries such as the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia in the last several years. In June 2018, we entered the world’s second largest credit market in the U.K. Our U.K. business provides data, analytics and technology solutions to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions across a diverse group of industries. With a strong record of growth and innovation in both core credit and emerging solutions we have achieved strong market success in the U.K.
In our Media vertical, we have made three recent acquisitions - Tru Optik Data Corp (“Tru Optik”) and Signal Digital, Inc. (“Signal”) in 2020, and TruSignal, Inc. (“TruSignal”) in 2019, which provide us with an industry-leading position within a clearly defined part of the Media industry. These acquisitions allow us to deliver more real-time targeted data across online streaming services to improve our customers’ digital marketing campaigns. Together with TransUnion’s complementary capabilities, these acquisitions will allow us to enhance the customer base with higher accuracy and transparency that is missing in current identity and audience development products in the digital marketing space. 
We enhanced our fraud and identity management service offerings when we acquired iovation in June 2018, one of the most advanced providers of device-based information in the world. We launched IDVision with iovation, which combines our extensive personal data with iovation’s digital data to offer an enhanced suite of identity management, authentication and fraud prevention solutions that protect businesses from fraud while improving the online user experience. This results in a global network of fraud and risk insights that help businesses to quickly and accurately determine authentic customers from fraudulent ones.
Our 2017 acquisitions of FactorTrust, Inc., a provider of consumer reporting models that captures a wide range of positive payment behaviors, and eBureau, LLC, a leading provider of custom analytic solutions with both credit-risk and anti-fraud applications demonstrate our commitment to build upon our success as a source of groundbreaking and versatile data and analytics capabilities.
We also developed a comprehensive set of domestic solutions in the Healthcare vertical. In June 2018, we acquired Healthcare Payment Specialists, Inc. By focusing on payment areas where superior technology and deep domain expertise can drive significant improvements, this part of our Healthcare business helps providers maximize Medicare reimbursements, which account for approximately 20% of total healthcare expenditures in the U.S. We also acquired Rubixis, Inc. (“Rubixis”) in October 2018. Rubixis’ revenue cycle optimization capabilities, particularly around denials and underpayments, round out our Healthcare solutions and positions us as the leader in revenue recovery for providers seeking to maximize reimbursement and prevent revenue leakage.
We have a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and driving long-term value creation, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pursuing acquisitions.
Segment Overview 
We manage our business and report our financial results in three reportable segments: U.S. Markets, International and Consumer Interactive. We also report expenses for Corporate, which provides shared services and conducts enterprise functions. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Part 
II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” and Note 18, “Reportable Segments,” for further information about our reportable segments.
U.S. Markets
Our U.S. Markets segment provides consumer reports, actionable insights and analytics such as credit and other scores, and technology solutions capabilities to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud.
We deliver our solutions across multiple industry vertical markets and report disaggregated revenue as follows:
Financial Services: The Financial Services vertical, which accounts for approximately 55.4% of our 2020 U.S. Markets revenue, consists of our consumer lending, mortgage, auto and cards and payments lines of business. Our financial services customers consist of most banks, credit unions, finance companies, auto lenders, mortgage lenders, online-only lenders (FinTech), and other consumer lenders in the United States. We also distribute our solutions through most major resellers, secondary market players and sales agents. Beyond traditional lenders, we work with a variety of credit arrangers, such as auto dealers and peer-to-peer lenders. We provide solutions across every aspect of the lending lifecycle; customer acquisition and engagement, fraud and ID management, retention and recovery. Our products are focused on mitigating risk and include credit reporting, credit marketing, analytics and consulting, identity verification and authentication and debt recovery solutions.
Emerging Verticals: Emerging verticals include Healthcare, Insurance, Tenant and Employment, Collections, Public Sector, Media, Diversified Markets and other verticals. Our solutions in these verticals are also data-driven and address the entire customer lifecycle. We offer onboarding and transaction processing products, scoring and analytic products, marketing solutions, fraud and identity management solutions and customer retention solutions.
Within U.S. Markets, we leverage our comprehensive data assets, data matching expertise and predictive analytics to develop risk-based solutions:
•Comprehensive Data Assets:    Our credit database contains the name and address of substantially all of the U.S. credit-active population, a listing of their existing credit relationships and their timeliness in repaying debt obligations. The information in our database is voluntarily provided by thousands of credit-granting institutions and other data furnishers. We enhance our data assets with alternative credit sources. We also actively source information from courts, government agencies and other public records including suits, liens, judgments, bankruptcies, professional licenses, real property, vehicle ownership, other assets, driver violations, criminal records and contact information for certain databases. Our databases are updated, reviewed and monitored on a regular basis.
•Predictive Analytics:    Our predictive analytics capabilities allow us to analyze our proprietary datasets and provide insights to our customers to allow them to drive better business decisions. Our tools allow customers to investigate past behavior, reasonably predict the likelihood of future events and strategize actions based on those predictions. We have numerous tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking, forecasting, fraud modeling and campaign optimization, all of which cater to specific customer requirements. Our predictive analytics capabilities are developed by an analytics team with deep industry experience and a broad array of specialized qualifications.
International
The International segment provides services similar to our U.S. Markets segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and technology solutions services and other value-added risk management services. We also have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer solutions similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment to help consumers proactively manage their personal finances. We report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions:
Canada: We have operated in Canada since 1989 and are one of only two nationwide consumer reporting agencies in the Canadian market. We operate across multiple verticals in Canada with leading positions in insurance and automotive with a strong and growing presence in Financial Services. Our Canadian customer base encompasses some of the largest companies in their verticals, including many of the top banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies and auto manufacturer lenders.
Latin America: We have been active in Latin America since 1985 when we entered the Puerto Rican market, and now operate in numerous Central and South American countries, including a strong presence in two major markets - Colombia and Brazil. We also have significant credit bureau businesses in the Dominican Republic and Chile, and a 25.69% ownership interest in 
Trans Union de México, S.A., the primary credit reporting agency in Mexico. In Guatemala, we maintain a centralized database that services Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
United Kingdom: In June 2018, we entered the world’s second largest credit market, the United Kingdom, when we acquired Callcredit, the second largest consumer credit bureau in the U.K. Our U.K. business provides data, analytics and technology solutions to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions across a diverse group of industries, and serves a broad set of customers including leading financial institutions and customers in other attractive, high-growth segments. 
Africa: We launched our operations in Africa by entering South Africa in 1993, and have since expanded into many surrounding countries. We are highly diversified and serve a variety of industries through traditional consumer credit reporting services, insurance solutions, auto information solutions, and commercial credit information services. We provide risk and information solutions in Africa to many of the leading banks, retailers, auto dealer groups, and insurance companies. 
India: In 2001, we partnered with prominent Indian financial institutions to create CIBIL, the first consumer and business credit reporting agency in India. We have since launched the country’s first generic credit score, which is the most widely used credit score across the financial services industry in India. In the absence of a comprehensive national ID, we created an innovative matching algorithm that allowed us to create the most extensive consumer credit database in India. We also own or have access to several non-credit data sources that we use to enhance our solutions, including the national voters’ registry, the confirmed and suspected fraud registry, property registry and tax ID database. We offer a suite of risk and information solutions across the credit lifecycle for banks, telecommunication companies and insurance companies, as well as consumer solutions such as online credit reports and scores. India has become our second largest and our fastest growing region.
Asia Pacific: Our operations in Asia Pacific include markets such as Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and China. Asia Pacific is a growing market with increasing demand for credit driven by a rising middle class that offers significant growth potential in analytics and technology solutions. We do business with many of the top financial institutions in the countries we serve. We have had a majority ownership interest in the principal consumer credit reporting company in Hong Kong since 1998. In partnership with leading credit card issuers in the Philippines, we launched the first consumer credit reporting agency in that market in 2011. We have also built credit risk scores for the National Credit Bureau of Thailand, in which we have a 12.25% ownership interest, the Credit Bureau of Singapore and the Credit Bureau of Malaysia.
Consumer Interactive
The Consumer Interactive segment offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution, and financial management for consumers. The segment also provides solutions that help businesses respond to data breach events. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels.
Direct: We provide services directly to consumers, primarily on a subscription basis through websites and mobile applications. Product features include credit reports, credit scores and analysis, alerts to changes in credit information, debt analysis, debt and retirement calculators, identity protection services, and the ability to restrict third-party access to a consumer’s TransUnion and Equifax credit reports through our paid subscription offering. We complement these features with educational content that explains how credit and financial data is used in various industries to evaluate consumers and how a consumer’s financial choices impact this evaluation. Our integrated, data-driven marketing strategy spans multiple channels including paid search, online display and email, which allows us to efficiently acquire and retain high quality consumers.
Indirect: We also provide our services to partners who may offer them on a stand-alone basis or with their own or other branded services as a bundle to consumers, governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection, credit monitoring, identity authentication, data breach services or as a means to engage with and acquire consumers. We offer a broad suite of solutions that include many of the features, educational content and customer support available in our direct channel. We have taken a proactive and flexible partnership approach, which has resulted in long-term strategic relationships with some of the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services in the U.S. consumer market as well as with several large financial institutions. Through these partnerships, we have significantly expanded the overall market as well as the reach of our business.
Corporate
Corporate provides support services to each segment, holds investments and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically enterprise-level costs and are primarily administrative in nature. 
Markets and Customers 
We have a highly diversified customer base that includes companies across multiple industries, including Financial Services, Healthcare and Insurance. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from companies in the financial services industry and from sales in the United States.
We leverage our comprehensive data assets, industry expertise and our technology infrastructure, allowing us to build solutions once and deploy them multiple times across the different verticals and regions. Our evolution to a hybrid public-private cloud infrastructure augments this capability. We provide services to our customers through real-time, online delivery for services such as credit reports and predictive scores, in batch form for services that help our customers proactively acquire new customers, cross-sell to existing customers and help them monitor and manage risk, and through our software-as-a-service offerings, which include a number of solutions that help businesses interpret data, maximize reimbursements, visualize insights, predict model results and apply their customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time automated decisions at the time of customer interaction, and through our websites to consumers, for various subscription-based and transaction-based products in the United States and in other regions we serve.
We market our services globally, primarily through our own sales force. We have dedicated sales teams for our largest customers focused by industry group and geography. These dedicated sales teams provide strategic account management and direct support to customers. We use shared sales teams to sell our services to mid-size customers. These sales teams are based in our headquarters office and in field offices strategically located throughout the United States and abroad. Smaller customers’ sales needs are serviced primarily through call centers. We also market our services through indirect channels such as resellers, who sell directly to businesses and consumers. Our interactive direct-to-consumer services are sold primarily through our website.
Seasonality 
Seasonality in the U.S. Markets segment is correlated to volumes of online credit data purchased by our financial services and mortgage customers, and our sales have generally been higher during the second and third quarters. Seasonality in our International segment is driven by local economic conditions and relevant macroeconomic market trends. In our Consumer Interactive segment, demand for our products is usually higher in the first half of the year, impacted by seasonality and our advertising spend. 
Competition
The market for our services is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of differentiated solutions, datasets, analytics capabilities, ease of integration with our customers’ technology, stability of services, customer relationships, innovation and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Our competitors vary based on the business segment, industry vertical and geographical market that our solutions address.
In our U.S. Markets segment, our competition generally includes Equifax, Experian and LexisNexis, in addition to certain competitors whom we only compete with in specific industry verticals. For example, we compete with FICO in the Financial Services vertical, with Verisk in the Insurance vertical, and with Experian Health, Waystar, and Cloudmed in the Healthcare vertical.
In our International segment, we generally compete with Equifax and Experian directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries or investments. We also compete with other competitors that may focus on a particular vertical, country or region.
In our Consumer Interactive segment, we generally compete with Equifax, Experian, FICO and LifeLock as well as emerging businesses, some of whom offer free credit information.
In addition to these competitors, we also compete with a number of other companies that may offer niche solutions catering to more specific customer requirements.
We believe the services we provide to our customers reflect our understanding of our customers’ businesses, the depth and breadth of our data and the quality of our analytics and technology solutions capabilities. By integrating our services into our customers’ workflows, we ensure efficiency, continuous improvement and long-lasting relationships.
Information Technology
Technology 
The continuous operation of our information technology systems is fundamental to our business. Our information technology systems collect, refine, access, process, deliver and store the data that is used to provide our solutions. Customers connect to our systems using a number of different technologies, including secured internet connections, virtual private networks and dedicated network connections. Control and management of the technology that operates our business is critical to our success and to this end, we directly control and manage all of our technology and infrastructure. Our technology relies on several third-
party best-of-breed solutions as well as proprietary software and tools which we integrate into our platforms. Our control of our technology and infrastructure allows us to prioritize any changes and manage the roll-out of any upgrades or changes. We contract with various third-party providers to help us maintain and support our systems.
We have established technology Centers-of-Excellence that utilize similar tools and technology in order to provide scale and efficiency in modifying existing applications and developing new applications for our businesses. We deploy new development methodologies globally to enable rapid delivery of solutions and increase our speed-to-market. Our technology team includes both our own employees as well as additional resources from third-party providers.
We believe that our technology is at the core of our innovative solutions, and we continually invest in our technology and thought leaders to be a market leader. We continue to make significant investments in our infrastructure to leverage the latest data and analytics technologies. We believe that our technology platform enables us to be quicker, more efficient and more cost-effective across each step of our process chain, including receiving, consolidating and updating data, implementing analytics and technology solutions capabilities, creating innovative solutions, delivering those solutions to our customers and incorporating customer feedback. Our platform has significant scale and capacity and enables us to deliver actionable information immediately to our customers. Our technology infrastructure gives us the ability to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, maintain and improve our delivery speeds, increase availability and enhance our product development capabilities, while at the same time lowering our overall cost structure.
Data Centers and Business Continuity
In order to create redundancy and increase resiliency, we utilize multiple data centers in all of our major markets. We generally employ similar technologies and infrastructures in each data center to enable the optimal sharing of technical resources across geographies.
We maintain a framework for business continuity that includes written policies requiring each business and operating unit to identify critical functions. Our businesses and operating units have processes in place that are designed to maintain such functions in case there is a disruptive event. We also have a specific disaster recovery plan that will take effect if critical infrastructure or systems fail or become disabled.
As part of our program, each business unit’s continuity plan is periodically updated and stored in a centralized database. These plans are monitored and reviewed by our compliance team. From time to time, our compliance team tests one or more of these plans using desktop exercises or in connection with actual events. We also periodically confirm the state of preparedness of our most critical disaster recovery procedures. We maintain systems redundancy plans for our primary U.S. data centers that allow for the transfer of capacity between geographically disbursed environments in the event there is a failure of computer hardware or a loss of our primary telecommunications lines or power sources. On an enterprise basis, our systems are designed to recover most of our operational capacity in a scenario where our primary data centers become inoperable.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, our business continuity plans kept us well positioned to continue to operate when the pandemic required global lockdowns. In each of the markets we serve, we quickly and effectively moved to a work-from-home model that we continue to adhere to. This has allowed us to protect our associates and the broader population while continuing to operate our businesses and provide services and solutions to customers and consumers.
Security
The security and protection of non-public consumer information is one of our highest priorities. TransUnion’s written information security program focuses on managing risk and fulfilling global information security regulations and standards, including ISO/IEC 27001:2013, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and other international regulatory expectations in locations where we operate. Our information security program follows a risk-based approach that continuously evaluates threats, industry events and asset values to introduce enhancements when necessary. We deploy a wide range of physical and technical safeguards that provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information we have in our possession. These safeguards include firewalls, intrusion protection and monitoring, anti-virus and malware protection, vulnerability threat analysis, management and testing, advanced persistent threat monitoring, forensic tools, encryption technologies, data transmission standards, contractual provisions, customer credentialing, identity and access management, data loss, access and anomaly reports and training programs for associates. We, with other global financial services organizations, including U.S. nationwide consumer credit reporting companies, share cyber threat and attack information through our participation in the Financial Information Sharing and Analysis Council and other forums that may be targeted at our industry to better understand and monitor our systems and our connectivity to our customers, as well as how specific solutions that were implemented to protect against such attacks are performing. We undergo SSAE 16 reviews annually, and several of our major customers routinely audit our security controls. We conduct an annual Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliance program and remain PCI certified. We regularly engage independent third-party organizations to evaluate TransUnion’s security program via testing and assessments. Additionally, we hire third parties to conduct independent information security assessments.
Intellectual Property and Licensing Agreement
Our intellectual property is a strategic advantage and protecting it is critical to our business. Because of the importance of our intellectual property, we treat our brand, software, technology, know-how, concepts and databases as proprietary. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights under the trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, as well as through the use of licenses and contractual agreements, such as nondisclosure agreements. While we hold various patents, we do not rely primarily on patents to protect our core intellectual property. Through contractual arrangements, disclosure controls and continual associate training programs, our principal focus is to treat our key proprietary information and databases as trade secrets. Also, we have registered certain trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, internet URLs and other marks of distinction in the United States and foreign countries, the most important of which is the trademark TransUnion name and logo. This trademark is used in connection with most of the services we sell and we believe it is a known mark in the industry.
We own proprietary software that we use to maintain our databases and to develop and deliver our services. We develop and maintain business-critical software that transforms data furnished by various sources into databases upon which our services are built. We also develop and maintain software to manage our consumer interactions, including providing disclosures and resolving disputes. In all business segments, we develop and maintain software applications that we use to deliver services to our customers, through a software-as-a-service model. In particular, we develop and maintain analytics and technology solutions infrastructure that we host and make available for our customers to develop and deploy analytics to improve business performance.
We license certain data and other intellectual property to other companies on arms-length terms that are designed to protect our rights to our intellectual property. We generally use standard licensing agreements and do not provide our intellectual property to third parties without a nondisclosure and license agreement in place.
We also license certain intellectual property that is important for our business from third parties. For example, we license credit-scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee.
Our History
TransUnion Corp. was spun-off from its parent, Marmon Holdings, Inc. in 2005 to the Pritzker family. On June 15, 2010, an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, on behalf of certain of its investment funds, acquired 51.0% of our outstanding common stock from the Pritzker family and certain employee and director stockholders of TransUnion Corp. On April 30, 2012, TransUnion Corp. was acquired by TransUnion Holding Company, Inc., substantially all the common stock of which was owned by Advent International Corporation and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. On March 26, 2015, TransUnion Holding Company, Inc. was renamed TransUnion and TransUnion Corp. was renamed TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc. On June 30, 2015, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Our stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “TRU.”
Legal and Regulatory Matters
Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a top priority. We are subject to numerous laws governing the collection, protection, dissemination and use of non-public personal information, credit information and other information. These laws are enforced by U.S. federal, state and local regulatory agencies, foreign regulatory authorities and, in some instances, through private civil litigation. Our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition or overall operations.
We proactively manage our compliance with laws and regulations through a global and legal compliance department that ensures enterprise standards are followed. Through the legal and compliance functions, we provide training to our associates, monitor all material laws and regulations, establish compliance policies, routinely review internal processes to determine whether business practice changes are warranted, assist in the development of new services, and promote regular meetings with principal regulators and legislators to establish transparency in our operations and create a means to understand and react should any issues arise.
U.S. Data and Privacy Protection
Our U.S. operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing privacy, data security, consumer protection and the use of consumer credit or an individual’s healthcare information. Certain of these laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized release of, or access to, this protected information. The laws and regulations that affect our U.S. business include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”): FCRA applies to consumer credit reporting agencies, including us, as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports. FCRA promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. FCRA limits what information may be reported by consumer reporting agencies, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports, establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, includes provisions designed to prevent identity theft and assist fraud victims, requires consumer reporting agencies to make a free annual credit report available to consumers and imposes many other requirements on consumer reporting agencies, data furnishers and users of consumer report information. Violation of FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. Regulatory enforcement of FCRA is under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another.
•The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”):  A central purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act is to “protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.” The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct, or prior published regulatory guidance or judicial interpretation has found the activity to be in accordance with law.
•The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”): In May 2018, Congress passed the EGRRCPA, which amended certain parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, FCRA and other U.S. federal laws applicable to us. Specifically, FCRA was amended to require that a credit reporting agency provide consumers with at least one year to submit a fraud alert to the credit reporting agency. The law also amended the FCRA for purposes of implementing a national security freeze that credit reporting agencies must provide free of charge upon formal request by a consumer. The credit freeze prevents credit reporting agencies from disclosing the content of a consumer report. Credit reporting agencies must also notify consumers of this right and provide instructions on how to implement and lift a credit freeze. The law increases veteran credit protection by implementing a process to remove inaccurate medical information and veteran medical debt and creates standards for verifying veteran medical debt. In addition, credit reporting agencies are required to provide free credit reporting monitoring, which requires notifying the consumer of any changes to his or her file, to any active duty military consumer.
•State unfair and deceptive practices acts and practices laws: Many states have enacted statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, relating to, among other things, marketing, disclosures and billing practices within the state or directed to consumers within the state. The Company and others in the industry may be subject to these laws with respect to the marketing of consumer credit information products.
•Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (the “GLBA”):  The GLBA regulates, among other things, the receipt, use and disclosure of non-public personal information of consumers held by financial institutions, including us. Several of our datasets are subject to GLBA provisions, including limitations on the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the technological, physical and administrative safeguarding of non-public personal information. Violation of the GLBA can result in civil and criminal liability. Regulatory enforcement of the GLBA is under the purview of the FTC, the CFPB, the federal prudential banking regulators, the SEC and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with each other.
•Drivers’ Privacy Protection Act (the “DPPA”):  The DPPA requires all states to safeguard certain personal information included in licensed drivers’ motor vehicle records from improper use or disclosure. The DPPA limits the use of this information sourced from State departments of motor vehicles to certain specified purposes, and does not apply if a driver has consented to the release of their data. The DPPA imposes criminal fines for non-compliance and grants individuals a private right of action, including actual and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. The DPPA provides a federal baseline of protections for individuals, and is only partially preemptive, meaning that except in a few narrow circumstances, state legislatures may pass laws to supplement the protections made by the DPPA. Many States are more restrictive than the federal law.
•Data security breach laws:  All states and some territories have adopted data security breach laws that may require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision 
of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the GLBA data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws, including regulatory investigations or enforcement actions from state attorneys general, who enforce state data breach or unfair and deceptive practices laws.
•Identity theft laws: Under the federal EGRRCPA, consumers can place a security freeze on their credit reports to prevent others from opening new accounts or obtaining new credit in their name and obtain one-year of fraud alerts free of charge. In addition, all states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit report. Generally, these state laws require us to respond to requests for a freeze within a certain period of time, to send certain notices or confirmations to consumers in connection with a security freeze and to unfreeze files upon request within a specified time period.
•Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”):  The FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. We must comply with the FTC Act when we market our services, such as consumer credit monitoring services through our Consumer Interactive segment. Our data collection, use and disclosure practices and the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the FTC Act, and our data practices or our failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action. There is no private right of action under the FTC Act.
• The Credit Repair Organizations Act (“CROA”):  CROA regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. Some courts have applied CROA to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others. CROA allows for a private right of action and permits consumers to recover all money paid for alleged “credit repair” services in the event of violation. We, and others in our industry, have settled purported consumer class actions alleging violations of CROA without admitting or denying liability.
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”):  HIPAA and HITECH require companies to implement reasonable safeguards to prevent intentional or unintentional misuse or wrongful disclosure of protected health information. In connection with receiving data from and providing services to entities in the healthcare industry or providing services to the healthcare industry, we may handle data subject to HIPAA and HITECH requirements. We obtain protected health information from healthcare providers and payors of healthcare claims that is subject to the privacy, security and transactional requirements imposed by HIPAA. We are frequently required to secure HIPAA-compliant “business associate” agreements with the providers and payors who supply data to us. As a business associate, we are obligated to limit our use and disclosure of health-related data to certain statutorily permitted purposes, HIPAA regulations, as outlined in our business associate agreements, and to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data. HIPAA and HITECH also require, in certain circumstances, the reporting of breaches of protected health information to affected individuals and to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A violation of any of the terms of a business associate agreement or noncompliance with HIPAA or HITECH data privacy or security requirements could result in administrative enforcement action and/or imposition of statutory penalties by the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a state attorney general. HIPAA and HITECH requirements supplement but do not preempt state laws regulating the use and disclosure of health-related information; state law remedies, which can include a private right of action, remain available to individuals affected by an impermissible use or disclosure of health-related data.
•California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”): The CCPA requires businesses to provide California consumers with certain rights regarding their personal information: the right to be informed about the type of information collected about them, the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information, the right to request deletion of their personal information, and the right to access their personal information. The CCPA exempts much of the data whose use is covered by FCRA, GLBA, HIPAA and DPPA and therefore much of our data is not subject to the CCPA. The CCPA creates a private right of action for security breaches. On November 3, 2020, California adopted the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which amends and expands CCPA. It is anticipated that most of the substantive provisions of CPRA will go into effect in 2023.
•Requirements for Government Contractors: Special requirements may apply to TransUnion when providing services to U.S. federal, state and local government agencies. The applicable requirements depend upon the monetary value of the awarded contract, the particular government agency awarding or funding the contract, the scope of services to be delivered by TransUnion, and the level of access that the agency will need to provide to TransUnion to enable TransUnion to perform the contract. For example and without limitation, TransUnion may need to abide by the Privacy Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Service’s Publication 4812, and various Federal Acquisition Regulation and associated supplemental contract clauses. Each of these laws, regulations and contract clauses dictates particular 
measures for the protection of personal information or information that is otherwise categorized as sensitive by the government. Government agencies frequently modify or supplement these requirements, and consequences for violations of applicable requirements may include penalties, civil liability and for severe infractions, criminal liability. 
We are also subject to U.S. federal and state laws that are generally applicable to any U.S. business with national or international operations, such as antitrust laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and various employment laws. We continuously monitor U.S. federal and state legislative and regulatory activities that involve credit reporting, data privacy and security, and other relevant subjects to identify issues in order to remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
International Data and Privacy Protection
We are subject to data protection, privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Canada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) - The PIPEDA and substantially similar provincial laws govern how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. The PIPEDA gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by such organizations. The PIPEDA requires compliance with the Canadian Standard Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. Most Canadian provinces also have laws dealing with consumer reporting. These laws typically impose an obligation on credit reporting agencies to have reasonable processes in place to maintain the accuracy of the information, place limits on the disclosure of the information and give consumers the right to have access to, and challenge the accuracy of, the information.
•Colombia: The Colombian Financial Data Protection Regime (Law 1266 of 2008) regulates the collection, use and transfer of personal data pertaining to financial services, including credit reporting. The Colombian General Data Protection Regime (Law 1581 of 2012 and Decree 1377 of 2013) covers regulation of all other personal data. Both of these regimes have applicability to credit reporting services in Colombia and together address obligations of information furnishers, database owners, consumer right of access, consumer consent and permitted information disclosures. 
•European Union: Our data management activities and the commercial solutions we make available to the European market are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This law establishes significant data protection and privacy standards that empower European Union consumers to exercise significant control over their personal data. In addition to a litany of substantive provisions empowering consumers to limit how data may be used, GDPR also imposes operational, data processing, and other technical requirements with which we must comply. Failure to comply with any provision of GDPR could result in significant regulatory or other enforcement penalties.
•United Kingdom: Our UK operations are subject to GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation (the “PECR”), which together govern the processing of personal data pertaining to UK citizens. Enforcement of data regulation and consumer privacy matters in the UK resides with the Information Commissioners Office (the “ICO”), an independent body set up to uphold the rights of individuals in relation to the use of their personal data. The provision of credit referencing services in the UK is also a regulated activity that is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). The FCA has regulated credit reference agencies since 2014 with the objectives of protecting consumers, protecting financial markets and promoting competition. TransUnion UK (previously Callcredit), Experian and Equifax were granted full FCA authorization in early 2016 and are therefore all required to follow the rules and principles issued by the FCA. 
In 2018, the FCA introduced Open Banking which aims to improve customer experience and to increase competition in the banking sector. Consumers can share transaction data with third parties via application program interfaces (“APIs”) to identify best products and take up multi-bank products. As part of Open Banking, the Second Payment Services Directive came into effect in January 2018 and affects the payments industry, allowing merchants to retrieve a customer’s account data from their bank with their consent. The implementation of Open Banking platforms will increase the number of payment service providers available to consumers and will expand beyond traditional banks. TransUnion UK is an authorized information services provider under this regime.
•South Africa: National Credit Act of 2005 (the “NCA”) - The NCA and its implementing regulations govern credit bureaus and consumer credit information. The NCA sets standards for filing, retaining and reporting consumer credit information. The NCA also defines consumers’ rights with respect to accessing their own information and addresses the process for disputing information in a credit file. The NCA is enforced by The National Credit Regulator who has authority to supervise and examine credit bureaus. In addition, the Protection of Personal Information Act (“POPIA”), went into effect on July 1, 2020, with enforcement commencing on July 1, 2021. POPIA regulates the processing of personal information of legal and juristic persons, and imposes compliance obligations and sanctions. 
•India: Credit Information Companies Regulation Act of 2005 (“CICRA”) - CICRA requires entities that collect and maintain personal credit information to ensure that it is complete, accurate and protected. Entities must adopt certain privacy principles in relation to collecting, processing, preserving, sharing and using credit information. In addition, India has privacy legislation that would allow individuals to sue for damages in the case of a data breach, if the entity negligently failed to implement “reasonable security practices and procedures” to protect personal data.
•Hong Kong: Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (“PDPO”) and The Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data (“COPCCD”) - PDPO and the COPCCD regulate the operation of consumer credit reference agencies. They prescribe the methods and security controls under which credit providers and credit reference agencies may collect, access and manage credit data. 
•Brazil: The Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”), went into effect on September 18, 2020. LGPD regulates the processing of personal information and imposes compliance obligations and sanctions comparable to those of GDPR. It is anticipated that the sanctions provisions of the LGPD will go into effect on August 1, 2021. 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses in the other countries where we operate.
Sustainability 
We believe that our responsibility to the world does not stop at connecting information, consumers, and clients; rather, we are dedicated to making meaningful, positive contributions to society. We are making an impact today through our commitments in advancing underrepresented people, enabling life-changing access to credit in new markets, and using trended data to help consumers improve their credit. 
To determine the environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) issues most material to our business we regularly engage key stakeholders and monitor the evolving landscape. We also conduct periodic materiality assessments to ensure that the focus of the sustainability program is aligned with ESG risks and opportunities. 
Our sustainability program focus areas are: 
•Security, Governance, and Compliance: We maintain robust security, compliance and governance programs to ensure alignment with the requirements of our industry. In particular, we focus on consumer privacy, data integrity and the overall security of information under our stewardship.
•People, Social Innovation, and Communities: We value our people and communities, and work diligently to provide expanded opportunities in and outside the workplace. We are dedicated to providing a welcoming, diverse, inclusive and growth-oriented work environment that enables all our people to reach their full potential. We also strive to expand just and equitable economic inclusion of all communities, providing the foundation for enhanced quality of life.
•Climate Change and Environmental Footprint: We seek to limit our environmental footprint and support responsible resource use. Reducing our energy and resource use lowers our operational costs and climate change impact, helping to ensure the well-being of communities and our associates.
Human Capital Management
We employed approximately 8,200 employees at December 31, 2020. Central to our long-term strategy is attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally with the right skills to drive our success. Our board of directors receives regular updates on topics including, sustainability, employee retention, engagement and survey results, enterprise compliance, investigations and associate health and safety.
Other than certain employees in Brazil, none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union or have terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages.
Diversity Strategy
We see diversity as a source of strength and know that it is essential to our mission, innovation and growth. At TransUnion, we know that diversity helps us win. We have a three-pronged approach to our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy consisting of the following:
•Hire: We seek to expand the diversity of our talent pool through a dedicated diversity recruiter, targeted sourcing methods and job postings. 
•Develop: We cultivate diverse internal talent through development plans and customized programming for under-represented groups.
•Promote: We continue to expand our rigorous pay and promotion practices designed to remove bias, including ongoing pay equity analysis and compensation review, and development opportunities designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all employees.
We believe that a critical component of continuing to deliver innovative products to consumers and customers is maintaining diverse and inclusive teams. We detail below our progress in advancing diversity in our leadership and associate population in alignment with Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting standards. Select workforce diversity statistics for 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

Talent Acquisition and Retention
Our talent acquisition and retention is multi-faceted. We aim to recruit the most qualified candidates, and strive for a diverse and well-balanced workforce.
We reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefits, and perquisite programs that allow employees and their families to thrive. Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce tailored to the variety of businesses and geographies in which we operate. 
This year we enhanced the ways we help our employees care for themselves and their families, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes child care benefits that provide access to onsite or community centers, enhanced back-up care choices that include personal caregivers, child care referral assistance and child care provider discounts, help with homework and a variety of parenting educational resources. We also provide our employees with access to free mental and behavioral health resources, including on-demand access to the Employee Assistance Program for employees and their dependents.
Employee Engagement, Training and Development
We prioritize and invest in helping our employees grow and build their careers through several training and development programs. These include online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats as well as executive talent and succession planning paired with an individualized development approach.
Safety and Wellness
We have heightened our focus on the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. We quickly and effectively moved to a work-from-home model in the early days of the pandemic in every market we serve, and continue to adhere to that model. This has allowed us to protect our associates and the broader population while continuing to operate our businesses and provide services and solutions to customers and consumers. In addition, we have taken several actions to support those who are financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the locations where we operate. We remain focused on ensuring impacted consumers are aware of resources and relief available to them, and we are working 
directly with our partners across the broader consumer credit ecosystem in an effort to prevent adverse impacts to consumers as a result of the pandemic. We are also working with industry peers to develop additional proactive solutions to help impacted consumers and to facilitate access to resources and educational materials aimed at consumers.
