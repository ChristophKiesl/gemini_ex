Item 1.    Business
OVERVIEW
Who We Are
IAC operates Vimeo, Dotdash and Care.com, among many other businesses, and also has majority ownership of ANGI Homeservices, which operates HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List and Handy.
As used herein, “IAC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and other similar terms refer to IAC/InterActiveCorp and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
Our History 
IAC began as a hybrid media/electronic retailing company over twenty-five years ago. Since then, IAC (directly and through predecessor entities) has transformed itself into a leading Internet company through the development, building, acquisition and distribution to its stockholders of a number of businesses over two decades, and IAC continues to build companies and invest opportunistically.
From and after the late 1990s, we acquired a number of e-commerce companies, including Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com), Expedia.com, Match.com, LendingTree, TripAdvisor, HomeAdvisor and AskJeeves, as well as Interval International.
In 2005, we completed the separation of our travel and travel-related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. (now known as Expedia Group, Inc.). In 2008, we separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc. (now part of Qurate Retail, Inc.), Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (now part of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation), Ticketmaster (now part of Live Nation, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc. (now LendingTree, Inc.). Following this transaction, we continued to invest in and acquire e-commerce companies, including About.com (now known as Dotdash) and a number of online dating companies in the United States and various jurisdictions abroad.
In 2017, we completed the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor financial reporting segment with those of Angie’s List, Inc. under a new publicly traded holding company that we control, ANGI Homeservices Inc. (“ANGI Homeservices”). And in 2018, through ANGI Homeservices, we acquired Handy Technologies, Inc., a leading platform in the United States for connecting consumers looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals.
In February 2020, we acquired Care.com, the leading online destination for families to easily connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes and for a wide variety of caregivers to easily connect with families. In June 2020, we completed the separation of our online dating businesses into an independent public company called Match Group, Inc. In August 2020, we announced that we had acquired an approximate 12% interest in MGM Resorts International, a leader in gaming, hospitality and leisure (“MGM”), for an aggregate of approximately $1 billion, introducing a new opportunity for us in the online gaming space.
In December 2020, we announced that the IAC board of directors had approved a plan to spin-off our full stake in our Vimeo business to IAC stockholders. Our Vimeo business will be separated from the remaining businesses of IAC through a series of transactions (which we refer to as the “Spin-off”) which, if completed in their entirety, will result in the transfer of our Vimeo business to Vimeo Holdings, Inc. (a newly formed subsidiary of IAC), which will be an independent, separately traded public company following the Spin-off (“New Vimeo”). The proposed transaction, which is subject to a number of conditions (including final approval by the IAC board of directors, certain IAC stockholder approvals and other customary conditions and approvals), is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.
EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE
IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and shares of Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis. As of the date of this report, Barry Diller, IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive, his spouse (Diane von Furstenberg) and his stepson (Alexander von Furstenberg), collectively hold 5,789,499 shares of Class B common stock representing 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Together with shares of common stock held as of the date of this report by Mr. Diller personally (172,708), Mr. von Furstenberg personally (66,004), a trust for the benefit of certain members of Mr. Diller’s family (136,711) and a family foundation (1,711), these holdings collectively represent approximately 41.4 % of the total outstanding voting power of IAC (based on the number of shares of common and Class B common stock outstanding on January 29, 2021). As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller also holds 1,000,000 vested options to purchase shares of common stock. 
Pursuant to that certain voting agreement, dated as of November 5, 2020, by and among Mr. Diller and the trustees of certain trusts through which all 5,789,499 shares of Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of common stock are held (the “Diller Parties”), on the one hand, and Joseph M. Levin, IAC’s Chief Executive Officer, on the other hand, (the “Voting Agreement”):
•the Diller Parties agreed to vote all shares of common stock and Class B common stock held by them in favor of Mr. Levin’s election to the IAC board of directors at each meeting of IAC stockholders at which Mr. Levin stands for election;
•prior to a vote being taken on specified Contingent Matters (a material acquisition or disposition of any assets or business by IAC or its subsidiaries, the entry by IAC into a material new line of business and the spin-off or split-off to IAC stockholders of (or similar transaction involving) a material business of IAC (excluding Vimeo, Inc.)) submitted for the approval of IAC stockholders, Mr. Diller (or following Mr. Diller’s death or disability or Mr. Diller ceasing to serve as a director or executive officer of IAC, Alexander von Furstenberg or his successor), in consultation with the other Diller Parties, and Mr. Levin, will seek agreement on how to vote the shares of common stock and Class B common stock held by the Diller Parties, provided, however, that if an agreement is not reached to support any such proposal, the Diller Parties have agreed to vote all shares of common stock and Class B common stock held by them against any such proposal; and
•if any of the Diller Parties determines to sell shares of Class B common stock to a person other than Mr. Diller, his family members or certain entities controlled by such persons, they will discuss with Mr. Levin selling such shares to him before selling to any other party.
The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate upon a "Change in Control" of IAC (as defined in the Restricted Stock Agreement between Mr. Levin and the Company dated November 5, 2020) or the termination of Mr. Levin’s employment with IAC.
 In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC’s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at least 5,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to certain limited matters specified in the governance agreement in the event that IAC’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period. 
As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to IAC’s organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of the IAC board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions. In addition, as a result of the Voting Agreement, Mr. Levin is currently in a position, subject to IAC’s organizational documents and Delaware law, to influence his election to IAC's board of directors and influence the outcome of Contingent Matters (as defined in the Voting Agreement).
DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES
 ANGI Homeservices
Overview
Our ANGI Homeservices segment includes the North American (United States and Canada) and European businesses and operations of ANGI Homeservices Inc. (“ANGI” or “ANGI Homeservices”), a publicly traded company formed on September 29, 2017 to facilitate the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor financial reporting segment and Angie’s List, Inc. (“Angie’s List”). As of December 31, 2020, IAC’s economic and voting interest in ANGI Homeservices was 84.3% and 98.2%, respectively.
Through ANGI’s various brands, including HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List and Handy, we connect quality home service professionals across more than 500 different categories, from repairing and remodeling to cleaning and landscaping, with consumers.
Through ANGI, we acquired Handy Technologies, Inc. (“Handy”), a leading platform in the United States for connecting individuals looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals, in October 2018. ANGI also owns and operates Fixd Repair, a home warranty and service company, mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small to mid-size businesses, and CraftJack, a third party lead generation service that connects home service professionals with consumers looking to complete home projects.
In addition to ANGI’s leading U.S. operations, ANGI owns leading home services online marketplaces in France (Travaux), Germany (MyHammer), Netherlands (Werkspot) and Italy (Instapro), owns controlling stakes in leading home services online marketplaces in the United Kingdom (MyBuilder) and Canada (HomeStars), and has operations in Austria through its MyHammer business.
Services
Overview. The HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service (“HomeAdvisor”) connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online. HomeAdvisor also connects consumers with service professionals instantly by telephone, as well as offers several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects. Handy connects consumers looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. Consumers request and pay for household services directly through the Handy platform and Handy fulfills these requests through the use of independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. Together, we refer to the HomeAdvisor and Handy businesses in the United States as the “Marketplace.” All Marketplace matching and pre-priced booking services and related tools and directories are provided to consumers free of charge.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Marketplace had a network of approximately 208,000 transacting service professionals, each of whom paid for consumer matches and/or or performed a job sourced through HomeAdvisor and/or Handy. Collectively, this service professional network provided services in more than 500 categories and 400 discrete geographical areas in the United States. The Marketplace generated approximately 32 million service requests during the year ended December 31, 2020. Service requests consist of fully completed and submitted domestic customer service requests submitted to HomeAdvisor and pre-priced bookings sourced through the HomeAdvisor and Handy platforms.
Angie’s List connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories, as well as provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews of local service professionals), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. Consumers can access the Angie’s List nationwide directory and related basic tools and services free of charge, as well as via purchased membership packages. Angie’s List also sells time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals.
Marketplace Consumer Services. Consumers can submit a request to be matched with a service professional through the HomeAdvisor and Handy platforms, as well as through certain paths on the Angie’s List platform and various third party affiliate platforms. Depending on the nature of the service request and the path through which it was submitted, consumers are generally matched with up to four HomeAdvisor service professionals, a Handy service professional or a combination of HomeAdvisor service professionals and service professionals from the Angie’s List nationwide directory (as and if available for the given service request).
Matches made through HomeAdvisor platforms and paths and various third party affiliate platforms are made by way of HomeAdvisor’s proprietary algorithm, based on several factors (including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request). Matches made through the Handy platform and path are based on the type of service desired, location and the date and time the consumer wants the service to be provided.
In all cases, service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched (or who have booked a job) directly and consumers can generally review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any of ANGI’s branded platforms or third party affiliate platforms.
For matches described above, in the case of HomeAdvisor service professionals, consumers are responsible for booking the service and paying the service professional directly, which can be done by the consumer independently or via the HomeAdvisor Pro-Pay App. In 2020, we expanded the features of this app to provide consumers with the ability to finance payments to service providers through a third party in addition to the ability to pay service professionals directly through the app. In the case of Handy service professionals, consumers book and pay for services directly through the Handy platform and then the Handy platform fulfills the booking with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services.
In addition to the general matching services described above, HomeAdvisor provides several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect. Also, in the case of certain tasks, HomeAdvisor provides pre-priced booking services, pursuant to which consumers can request services through a HomeAdvisor platform and pay HomeAdvisor for the services directly. HomeAdvisor then fulfills the booking with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. Lastly, consumers can also access the online HomeAdvisor True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as a library of home services-related content.
In addition to the general matching services described above, in certain markets, consumers can also submit a request to book a specific Handy service professional for a given job. Also, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by Handy service professionals, which are then paid for directly through the applicable third party retail partner platform.
Marketplace Service Professional Services. HomeAdvisor service professionals pay fees for consumer matches and subscription fees for HomeAdvisor memberships, which are available for purchase through our sales force. The basic HomeAdvisor annual membership package includes membership in the HomeAdvisor network of service professionals, as well as access to consumer matches (for which additional fees are paid) through HomeAdvisor platforms and a listing in the HomeAdvisor online directory and certain other affiliate directories, among other benefits. 
In addition to the commercial membership terms, in order to be admitted to the HomeAdvisor network, service professionals must satisfy certain criteria, including verification of any state-level licensure requirements and owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals passing certain criminal background checks. Service professionals must maintain at least a three-star customer rating to remain in the HomeAdvisor network. If a service professional in the HomeAdvisor network fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the applicable membership term, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process and/or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any of our service channels, the service professional will be subject to removal from the HomeAdvisor network.
Service professionals on the Handy platform are provided with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals. In order to be admitted to the Handy platform, service professionals must verify their home services experience, as well as satisfy certain credential verification and background checks, either as individual service professionals or as owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals. Service professionals must maintain an acceptable customer service rating to remain on the Handy platform and access to the platform will be revoked in the case of service professionals who repeatedly receive low customer service ratings. 
Angie’s List Consumer Services. Through Angie’s List, consumers can register and search for a service professional in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional. Consumers who register can access ratings and reviews and search for service professionals, as well as access certain promotions. Two premium membership packages are available for a fee, which include varying degrees of online and phone support, access to exclusive promotions and features and the award-winning Angie’s List print magazine.
Angie’s List Service Professional Services. Angie’s List provides service professionals with a variety of services and tools, including certification. Generally, service professionals with an overall member grade below a “B” are not eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member grade, and owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals must pass certain criminal background checks and attest to applicable licensure requirements. Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must purchase term-based advertising to obtain certification. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 39,000 certified service professionals under contract for advertising.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in directory search results for an applicable category, with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, HomeAdvisor’s proprietary algorithm will determine where a given service professional appears within related results. 
Revenue
ANGI revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which consists of fees paid by HomeAdvisor service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service) and revenue from completed jobs sourced through the HomeAdvisor and Handy platforms. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered and geographic location of service.
ANGI revenue is also derived from: (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals, (ii) HomeAdvisor service professional membership subscription fees, (iii) membership subscription fees from consumers and (iv) service warranty subscription and other services.
Marketing
ANGI markets its products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid search engine marketing, display advertising and third party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through free search engine marketing and email. Pursuant to third party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote certain of our products and services (and those of certain of our service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through the applicable ANGI platform, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request the applicable ANGI platform. ANGI also markets its products and services to consumers through relationships with select third party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail.
ANGI markets HomeAdvisor matching services and membership subscriptions to service professionals primarily through its sales force, which is based in various locations across the United States (the Denver, Colorado area: Lenexa, Kansas; New York, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Chicago, Illinois), as well as through remotely-based sales representatives. These products and services are also marketed, together with Handy products, pre-priced booking services and various directories, through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. Term-based advertising and related products are marketed to service professionals primarily through the Indianapolis-based sales force.
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. ANGI businesses compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. ANGI also competes with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. ANGI believes its biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which are by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
We believe that ANGI’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of ANGI’s network of service professionals and the breadth of its online directory listings; 
•its ability to consistently generate service requests, jobs and pre-priced bookings through the Marketplace and leads through ANGI’s online directories that generate business for service professionals in a cost-effective manner; 
•its ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through its platforms, including its various mobile applications (rather than through search engine marketing or via free search engine referrals); 
•the functionality of the websites and mobile applications of ANGI’s various brands and the attractiveness of their features and ANGI’s products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as ANGI’s continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally; 
•its ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, ANGI’s various brands, particularly its Angie’s List, HomeAdvisor and Handy brands; and 
•the quality and consistency of service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.
Vimeo
Overview
Through Vimeo, we operate the world’s leading all-in-one video software solution, providing the full breadth of video tools through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) model. Vimeo’s comprehensive tools empower its users to create and communicate through high-quality video on a single, integrated platform. At December 31, 2020, IAC held 89.7% of Vimeo’s Class A voting common stock and 97.6% of Vimeo's Class B non-voting common stock, or 93.2% of Vimeo's total outstanding capital stock. 
Services
Vimeo offers its services on basic (free), self-serve subscription plan and enterprise subscription plan bases, effectively employing a “freemium” pricing strategy that offers free membership and access to its video tools alongside paid subscription plans for advanced video capabilities. 
Any user can access a basic (free) Vimeo membership by signing up with an email address. With a basic membership, users can create, record, upload and share videos through Vimeo’s website and native apps for free. Basic users are subject to weekly and total caps on uploaded videos and do not have access to advanced video capabilities, such as live streaming or the ability to add team members. Vimeo provides opportunities for basic users to upgrade to a paid subscription at natural points in the user experience, such as when a basic user nears or hits an uploaded video cap. Vimeo also highlights the advanced video capabilities of its subscription plans natively within the basic user experience.
Vimeo also offers various subscription plans on a “self-serve” basis, which means that users can sign up directly through Vimeo’s website and native apps and pay related subscription fees by way of a credit card or in-app purchase mechanisms. Subscription fees for self-serve plans vary depending upon the precise mix of capabilities within a given plan type, which include video creation, collaboration, distribution, hosting, marketing, monetization and analytics, and in the case of higher-priced plan types, the ability to add multiple team members to the plan.
Vimeo also offers various enterprise subscription plans through its sales force. Enterprise plans provide users with additional capabilities beyond the self-serve plans described immediately above, as well as options for dedicated support, account management, service level agreements and professional live event services. Types of enterprise plans currently include: (i) Vimeo Enterprise, an organization-wide video solution that includes secure unlimited live streaming of events, a corporate video portal, single-sign-on support, content delivery network optimization to improve quality-of-service in corporate networks and the ability to use Vimeo technology on a fully branded basis (so that the company’s own branding is featured instead of Vimeo branding), (ii) Vimeo OTT, an over-the-top (OTT) video monetization solution that allows users to launch and run their own video streaming channels directly to their respective audiences through a branded web portal, mobile apps and Internet-enabled TV apps, and (iii) Vimeo Custom, custom plans designed and optimized for high-volume users (for example, plans that offer significantly higher storage or bandwidth).
As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 1.5 million subscribers to Vimeo’s various self-serve and enterprise plans and its video player was embedded on millions of websites and powered billions of views a month, with over 300,000 new videos being uploaded to the Vimeo platform each day. 
Marketing
Vimeo acquires subscribers primarily through: (i) the conversion of basic (free) users to subscribers through organic efforts, including word-of-mouth referrals and in-product messaging, (ii) the acquisition of subscribers through marketing spend, primarily through digital media channels (including paid search engine marketing, social media, email campaigns and display advertising), (iii) in the case of subscribers to its enterprise services, its sales force, and (iv) the acquisition of subscribers through third party partnerships and integrations.
Revenue
Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from annual and monthly SaaS subscription fees paid by subscribers for self-serve and enterprise subscription plans, with the most common subscription being an annual subscription.
Competition
Vimeo competes with large social media platforms (such as Facebook and YouTube) that allow users to share videos for free, as well as provide users with a built-in audience, social media-specific capabilities and the ability to monetize video through advertising. Unlike Vimeo, these platforms generally do not allow users to control whether advertising accompanies their videos (and if so, the type of advertising). Vimeo also competes with a variety of companies that provide niche video services focused on a specific user segment or video use case. 
We believe that Vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by providing an ad-free, high quality centralized video solution that eliminates the need for users to connect and pay for multiple software providers and is easy to use and affordable. We also believe that the diversity, size and engagement of Vimeo’s creative community is an asset that is difficult for others to replicate.
We believe that Vimeo’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•the quality of its technology platforms, video tools and user and subscriber experience; 
•whether its SaaS subscription plans resonate with subscribers, particularly with small business and enterprise subscribers; 
•its ability to drive visitors to its platforms and acquire subscribers in a sustainable manner through its sales and marketing efforts; 
•its ability to retain existing subscribers by continuing to provide a compelling value proposition and convert users of its basic (free) service into subscribers; 
•the continued ability of users and subscribers to distribute Vimeo-hosted content across third party platforms (including social media platforms (Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter and Pinterest), vertical content websites, apps and marketplaces) and the prominence and visibility of such content within search engine results and third-party platforms; 
•its ability to continue to host and stream high-bandwidth video on a scalable platform; and 
•the recognition and strength of the Vimeo brand relative to competitor brands.
Dotdash
Overview
Dotdash is a portfolio of digital publishing brands that collectively provide expert information and inspiration in select vertical content categories to over 90 million users each month. 
Content
As of the date of this annual report, Dotdash consisted of the following brands:

•TreeHugger.com, a leading online resource for news and information related to sustainability, as well as green news, solutions and product information; 
•ThoughtCo, a leading online information and reference site with a focus on expert-created education content where users can find answers to questions and information regarding a broad range of disciplines, including science, technology and math, languages, the humanities and the arts; and

 Through these brands, Dotdash provides original and engaging digital content in a variety of formats, including articles, illustrations, videos and images. Dotdash works with hundreds of experts in their respective fields to create the content that it publishes, including doctors, chefs and certified financial advisors, among others. 
Revenue
Dotdash revenue consists principally of display advertising revenue and performance marketing revenue. Display advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly by the Dotdash sales team and through programmatic advertising networks. Performance marketing revenue includes affiliate commerce and performance marketing commissions. Affiliate commerce commission revenue is generated when Dotdash refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction. Performance marketing commissions are generated on a cost-per-click or cost-per-action basis.
Marketing
Dotdash markets its content through a variety of digital distribution channels, including search engines, social media platforms and via direct navigation to Dotdash sites. Users who engage with Dotdash brands are invited to share Dotdash content and sign up for Dotdash email newsletters. 
Competition
Dotdash competes with a wide variety of parties in connection with its efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers. Competitors primarily include other online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories and social channels. 
Some of Dotdash’s current competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger user bases and/or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than Dotdash does. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their content, which could result in greater market acceptance of their content relative to Dotdash content. 
We believe that Dotdash’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•the quality and freshness of the content and features on Dotdash websites, relative to those of its competitors; 
•its ability to successfully create or acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner; 
•the relevance, expertise and authority of the content featured on Dotdash websites; and 
•its ability to successfully drive visitors to Dotdash’s portfolio of digital brands in a cost-effective manner.

The majority of the paid listings displayed by Ask Media Group businesses is supplied to us by Google Inc. (“Google”) pursuant to a services agreement with Google. Pursuant to this agreement, Ask Media Group businesses transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through an Ask Media Group business and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us. In cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party as traffic acquisition costs. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations—Certain of our businesses depend upon arrangements with Google.”
Desktop revenue largely consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. The majority of the paid listings displayed by our Desktop businesses are supplied to us by Google in the manner, and pursuant to the services agreement with Google, described above. To a lesser extent, Desktop revenue also includes fees paid by subscribers for downloadable desktop applications as well as display advertisements. 
Marketing
Ask Media Group’s various properties are marketed primarily through the acquisition of traffic from major search engines and their syndication networks, which involves the purchase of keyword-based sponsored listings that link to search results pages of Ask Media Group properties, and other types of display media (primarily banner advertisements). 
Ask Media Group content is also marketed through a variety of digital distribution channels, including search engines, social media platforms, display advertising networks and native advertising networks, as well as a number of advertising agencies that acquire traffic via these channels for certain Ask Media Group properties. 
Our various desktop applications are marketed to users primarily through digital display advertisements and paid search engine marketing efforts. 
Competition
In the case of general search services, Ask Media Group’s competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search-centric portals that engage in marketing efforts similar to those of Ask Media Group, such as System1, CBSi and Verizon Media, among others. In the case of content, Ask Media Group’s competitors primarily include online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories and social channels. We believe that Ask Media Group’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon: 
•its continued ability to monetize search traffic via paid search listings; 
•its continued ability to market its search websites in a cost-effective manner; 
•the relevance and authority of search results, answers and other content displayed on its various properties; 
•its continued ability to differentiate Ask Media Group search websites (which depends primarily upon it continued ability to deliver quality, authoritative and trustworthy content to users), as well as the ability to attract advertisers to these websites; 
•its ability to successfully create or acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner; and 
•its ability to monetize content pages with display and native advertising and other forms of digital advertising. 
Our Desktop business competes with a number of other companies that develop and market similar desktop browser application products and distribute them through direct-to-consumer and third party agreements. Our Desktop business also competes with search engines to provide users with new tab, homepage and/or default search services. We believe that the ability of our Desktop business to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•its ability to maintain industry-leading monetization solutions for desktop browser applications in response to evolving technology and changing requirements from operators of large platforms, including Google; 
•the size and stability of its global base of installed desktop application products and the ability to grow this base; 
•the continued creation of desktop browser applications that resonate with consumers, which depends upon the continued ability to bundle attractive features, content and services (some of which may be owned by third parties);
•its ability to differentiate its desktop browser applications from those of competitors; and 
•its ability to market and distribute desktop browser applications through direct-to-consumer (primarily the Chrome Web Store) channels in a cost-effective manner. 
Some competitors of Ask Media Group and our Desktop business have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger user bases and/or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than these businesses do. As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products, services and/or content, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products, services and/or content relative to those of Ask Media Group and our Desktop business.

Mosaic Group 
Overview. Through Mosaic Group, we are a leading developer and provider of global subscription mobile applications. As of December 31, 2020, Mosaic Group had approximately 3.8 million mobile paying subscribers.
Through Mosaic Group, collectively, we operated 44 branded mobile applications in over 28 languages across 192 countries as of December 31, 2020. These branded mobile applications consist of applications spanning a variety of categories, each designed to meet the varying and unique needs of subscribers and enhance their daily lives, including: iTranslate, through which subscribers can connect and communicate across numerous languages; TelTech, which develops and distributes unique and innovative mobile communications applications that help protect consumer privacy; Robokiller, which thwarts both telemarketing and illegal spam phone calls; NOAA Radar, which provides up-to-date weather information and storm tracking worldwide; Scanner for Me, which allows users to create, sign and edit PDFs using the camera on their mobile phones; Productive, a goal-setting and habit-tracking app that allows consumers to better plan and control their lives; Planes Live, a go-to companion application for frequent fliers; and Daily Burn, which provides streaming fitness and workout videos. Mosaic Group’s various branded mobile applications are distributed to subscribers primarily through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 
We believe that Mosaic Group has the personnel, systems and expertise necessary to build and scale leading mobile applications and grow mobile subscription businesses. By applying these resources and skills to both organically developed and acquired mobile applications, Mosaic Group has demonstrated success in scaling mobile applications across a wide variety of utility and productivity categories. With a deep commitment to delivering continuing value to its subscribers and users and a continued focus on entering new categories, data-driven decision-making based on key performance indicators and best-in-class data modeling, user acquisition and optimization teams, Mosaic Group has grown to become one of the world’s leading mobile subscription businesses.
Revenue. Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees paid by subscribers for downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and directly from consumers, as well as revenue generated from display advertisements.
Marketing. We market our mobile applications to users primarily through digital storefronts (primarily the Apple App Store and Google Play Store) and digital display advertisements on social media, messaging and media platforms, as well as in-app and cross-app advertising.
Competition. The applications industry is competitive and has no single, dominant desktop or mobile application brand globally. 
We believe that the ability of Mosaic Group to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the continued growth of consumer adoption of free and paid mobile applications generally and related engagement levels; 
•its ability to operate its various mobile applications as a scalable platform; 
•its ability to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers in a cost-effective manner; 
•its ability to market and distribute its mobile applications through third party digital app stores, including the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, in a cost-effective manner;
•its ability to continue to optimize its marketing and monetization strategies;
•the continued growth of smartphone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets; 
•the continued strength of Mosaic Group brands; and 
•its ability to introduce new and enhanced mobile applications in response to competitor offerings, consumer preferences, platform demands, social trends and evolving technological landscape.
Care.com
Overview. Through Care.com, we are the leading online destination for families to easily connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes and for a wide variety of caregivers to easily connect with families. Care.com is building a premier destination for families, caregivers and enterprises (through which they can provide care-related benefits to their employees) that features a portfolio of products and services spanning the entire care journey, including guidance for care options, searching for and matching with caregivers for a wide range of care options (such as a nannies for children or home health care aides for seniors), care management features and access to care-related activities and resources. 
Services. Through Care.com, we primarily offer online consumer matching and consumer payment solutions for families searching for care for their loved ones and enterprise solutions seeking to provide care-related benefits to their employees.

•Consumer matching solutions. Through free and paid memberships to consumer matching services, Care.com offers a variety of resources designed to match and guide families toward the best care for their loved ones. Resources include online matches with potential caregivers and related resources, augmented by assistance from subject matter experts. Free basic membership provides families with the ability to set up an account, post a job, search and review caregiver profiles and receive applications for caregivers. Paid premium membership, in addition to basic membership features, provides families with the ability to contact caregivers to schedule interviews, request caregiver background checks, reply to applications and messages from caregivers and access certain promotions and discounts. 
Through our consumer matching solutions, families are matched with caregivers (in-home and out-of-home) who meet their diverse and evolving care needs (long term, short term and occasional at irregular intervals). Matching is facilitated by algorithms designed to highlight the most relevant caregiver(s) (based on the type and frequency of care requested, hourly rate for the job and responsibilities and other job requirements), as well as an internally monitored messaging system. In-home caregivers create and post detailed Care.com profiles that include photos, bios, work histories and reviews, the type of care they primarily provide, their experience, certifications and qualifications and their availability, hourly rate and payment details, among other information. Out-of-home caregivers and other care-related businesses (such as senior care facilities, tutoring companies, camps and activities) can also market their services, as well as recruit individual caregivers for employment, through Care.com. 
To enhance the safety of our consumer matching solutions, we require all individual caregivers on our matching platform in the United States to complete CareCheck, a background check conducted by a third party consumer reporting agency. We also offer multiple levels of additional background check options through third party consumer reporting agencies for purchase by families and caregivers. While we believe that CareCheck and additional background checks are good practice and recommend them to families and caregivers, they have limitations and, even with these safety measures, no assurances can be provided regarding the future behavior of any caregiver on our platform. 
We also maintain a safety center that provides resources and information designed to help families and caregivers     make safer and more informed hiring and job selection decisions, including recommendations to families for     screening, interviewing and ongoing monitoring of caregivers, as well as recommendations to caregivers for avoiding scams. We also encourage members to contact us if they believe another member may have violated our community     guidelines.
•Consumer payment solutions. Through Care.com, we also offer consumer payments solutions that provide families with several options to manage their financial relationship with their caregiver, as well as help caregivers professionalize and manage their careers. These payment solutions include: 
•HomePay, our payroll and tax product for families that employ nannies, housekeepers or other domestic employees. HomePay is a technology-based, turnkey service that includes automated payroll processing and household employer-related tax filings at the federal, state and local levels. In addition, caregivers paid through HomePay may qualify for important benefits, such as unemployment insurance and social security. HomePay is available to anyone (not just members of our consumer matching solutions) for a fee; and 
•our peer-to-peer payments solution, which enables families to make electronic payments to their caregivers directly through our website or mobile applications. We believe that this solution is particularly applicable to (and helpful in the case of) families who pay caregivers who provide care services at irregular intervals (such as babysitters, after-school caregivers or tutors, or in varying amounts each time services are performed). 
•Enterprise solutions. Through Care.com, we also offer Care@Work, a comprehensive suite of services that employers can offer their employees as an employee benefit. Currently, employers can choose from a number of services, including: 
•our consumer matching solutions; 
•back-up care services for employees who need alternative care arrangements for their child or senior when their regular care is not available (for example, school closures or the illness of their child or regular caregiver); and
•access to consultation and referral services to support work-life challenges faced by employees, such as senior care planning services to assist employees with finding the most suitable care option for their aging family member and related financial guidance, legal services and educational assistance. 
. 
Employers generally pay for our enterprise solutions on a per employee per year basis and have access to features that allow them to manage employee access and track aggregate usage. Depending on the suite of services selected and the employer’s preference, the employer may subsidize all, a portion or none of the cost of these solutions for employees.
Revenue. Care.com generates revenue primarily through subscription fees from families and caregivers for its suite of products and services, as well as through annual contracts with corporate employers who provide access to Care.com’s suite of products and services as an employee benefit and through contracts with businesses that recruit employees through its platform. 
Marketing. Care.com markets its various products and services to families and caregivers through a diverse mix of free and paid offline and online marketing, as well as its sales team. We believe that most families and caregivers currently find Care.com through unpaid marketing channels, primarily through word-of-mouth, referrals and online communities and forums, as well as search engine marketing (free and paid) and repeat users. Paid direct marketing efforts include offline channels, such as network cable TV, OTT channels and direct mail, as well as through paid search engine marketing, display advertising, third party affiliate agreements and select paid job board sites. In addition, Care.com markets its employee-benefit product offerings directly to enterprises through its sales team.
Competition. In the case of consumer matching solutions, Care.com primarily competes with traditional offline consumer resources for finding caregivers, as well as online job boards and other online care marketplaces. We believe Care.com’s biggest competition comes from the traditional offline methods through which most consumers find caregivers, which are by word-of-mouth, referrals and online communities and forums. In the case of payment solutions, Care.com primarily competes with similar products offered by providers of online and offline payroll services. Care.com also competes for a share of the overall recruiting and advertising budgets of care-related businesses with traditional, offline media companies and other online marketing providers. In the case of enterprise solutions, Care.com primarily competes with other providers of employer-sponsored care services and employee benefit products, particularly those that provide backup child and senior care services.
We believe that Care.com’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of its network of families and caregivers;
•the functionality and reliability of its websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features (and Care.com’s various products and services) generally to families and caregivers;
•its continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with families and caregivers;
•the quality, completeness and consistency of caregiver profiles and job postings, as well the reliability of background check and other security measures and trustworthiness and reliability of caregivers;
•its ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, Care.com brands
•its ability to continue expand its enterprise solutions business; and 
•its ability to continue to expand its businesses in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
Intellectual Property
We rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets, and regard this intellectual property as critical to our success. We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from August 2021 to July 2037.
We have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew (or secure by contract where appropriate) trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections (as and if we deem appropriate) based on then current facts and circumstances, and intend to continue to do so in the future.
We rely on a combination of internal and external controls, including applicable laws, rules and regulations, and restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish, protect and otherwise control our various intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad involving matters that are important to (or may otherwise impact) our various businesses, such as broadband internet access, online commerce, privacy and data security, advertising, intermediary liability, consumer protection, taxation, worker classification and securities compliance. These domestic and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are continually evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations (and any amended, proposed or new laws and regulations) are 
often uncertain, particularly in the Internet industry, and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and over time, which could result in conflicts with the current policies and practices of IAC and its various businesses.
Because we conduct substantially all of our business on the Internet, we are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that could adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact whether or how we may provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and/or undermine an open and neutrally administered Internet access. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. This order, which was released in January 2018 and took effect in June 2018, reversed net neutrality protections in the United States that had been in place since 2015, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by Internet service providers. Also, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“Section 230”), which generally provides immunity for website publishers from liability for third party content appearing on their platforms and the good faith removal of third party content from their platforms that they may deem obscene or offensive (even if constitutionally protected speech), since its adoption has been (and continues to be) subject to a number of challenges. The immunities conferred by Section 230 could also be narrowed or eliminated through amendment, regulatory action or judicial interpretation. In 2018, the U.S. Congress amended Section 230 to remove certain immunities and most recently, in 2020, various members of the U.S. Congress introduced bills to further limit Section 230, and a petition was filed by a Department of Commerce entity with the Federal Communications Commission to commence a rulemaking to further limit Section 230. Any future adverse changes to Section 230 could result in additional compliance costs for us and/or exposure for additional liabilities.
Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users and subscribers, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data security, primarily in the case of our operations in the United States and the European Union and the handling of personal data of users located in the United States and the European Union. Recent examples of comprehensive regulatory initiatives in the area of privacy and data security include a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which applies to certain companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union, imposes significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance, as well as provides a private right of action for individual claimants. The GDPR will continue to be interpreted by European Union data protection regulators, which may require us to make changes to our business practices and could generate additional risks and liabilities. The European Union is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies.
In addition, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to the U.S., and on July 16, 2020, the ECJ invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as an adequate safeguard when transferring personal data from the EEA to the U.S. These regulations continue to evolve and may ultimately require us to devote resources towards compliance and/or make changes to our business practices to ensure compliance, all of which could be costly. Also, the exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. At the same time, many jurisdictions abroad in which we do business have already or are currently considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
Moreover, while multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information are being considered by the U.S. Congress and various U.S. state legislatures, certain U.S. state legislatures have already enacted privacy legislation, one of the strictest and most comprehensive of which is the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020 (the “CCPA”). The CCPA provides new data privacy rights for California consumers, and restricts the ability of certain of our businesses to use personal California user and subscriber information in connection with their various products, services and operations. The CCPA also provides consumers with a private right of action for security breaches, as well as provides for statutory damages. In addition, on November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24 (the “California Privacy Rights Act of 2020”), which amends certain provisions of the CCPA and becomes effects January 1, 2023, will further restrict the ability of certain of our businesses to use personal California user and subscriber information in connection with their various products, services and operations and/or impose additional operational requirements on such businesses. Lastly, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also increased its focus on privacy and data security practices, as evidenced by the first-of-its-kind, $5 billion dollar fine against a social media platform for privacy violations in 2019. As a result, we could be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions in this area. See “Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations — General Risk Factors — The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs.”
As a provider of certain subscription-based products and services, we are also impacted by laws or regulations affecting whether and how our businesses may periodically charge users for membership or subscription renewals. For example, the European Union Payment Services Directive, which became effective in 2018, could impact the ability of certain of our businesses to process auto-renewal payments for, as well as offer promotional or differentiated pricing to, users who reside in the European Union. Similar laws exist in the U.S., including the federal Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act and various U.S. state laws, and legislative and regulatory enactments or amendments are under consideration in a number of U.S. states.
We are also sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws. The European Commission and several European countries have recently adopted (or intend to adopt) proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which certain of our European businesses are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including taxes based on a percentage of revenue). 
In addition, in the case of certain businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment and, to a lesser extent, our Care.com business, we are particularly sensitive to the adoption of worker classification laws, specifically, laws that could effectively require us to change the classification of certain of the service professionals and caregivers affiliated these businesses from independent contractors to employees, as well as changes to state and local laws or judicial decisions relating to the definition and/or classification of independent contractors. For example, California’s worker classification statute (AB 5) effectively narrows the definition of an independent contractor by requiring hiring entities to use a different, stricter test to determine a given worker’s classification. In addition, AB 5 places the burden of proof for classifying workers as independent contractors on hiring entities and provides enforcement powers to the state and certain cities. Also, AB 5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion and it is possible that other jurisdictions, including New York and New Jersey, may enact similar laws. Since we currently treat certain of the service professionals (and, in limited cases, the caregivers) affiliated certain businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment and Care.com as independent contractors for all purposes, we do not withhold federal, state and local income or other employment related taxes, make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments or provide workers’ compensation insurance with respect to such individuals. If we are required as the result of new or amended laws or regulations to reclassify these individuals as employees, it could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs, including exposure (for prior and future periods) under federal, state and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest.
Also, in the case of the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment, we may be subject to certain U.S. state and local licensure requirements related to the provision of pre-priced booking services. If so, typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority for cause at any time. Moreover, in some jurisdictions, the loss of a license for cause could result in the loss of licenses in other jurisdictions and/or could make it more difficult to obtain new and/or renewal licenses. Obtaining and renewing such license and related compliance could be costly and the failure to comply with licensure requirements could result in bad publicity and related damage to our reputation, brands and brand-building efforts and/or actions by governmental and regulatory authorities and/or litigation, as well as generate additional risks and liabilities (including the imposition of penalties). 
We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations governing the marketing and advertising activities of our various businesses conducted by or through telephone, email, mobile digital devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM act and similar state laws, rules and regulations, as well as local laws, rules and regulations and relevant agency guidelines governing background screening.
Lastly, as a company based in the U.S. with foreign offices in various jurisdictions worldwide, we are subject to a variety of foreign laws governing the foreign operations of its various businesses, as well as U.S. laws that restrict trade and certain practices, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Human Capital
Overview
IAC’s future success depends upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce across our various businesses worldwide. While policies and practices related to the identification, hiring, development, motivation and retention of employees vary across IAC and our various businesses, at their core, such policies and practices are generally designed to: (i) increase long-term IAC stockholder value by attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding employees with the competence, character, experience and ambition necessary to enable the Company to meet its growth objectives, (ii) encourage and support the professional development of, and engender loyalty among, employees who have demonstrated the strength, vision and determination necessary to overcome obstacles and unlock their true professional potential by providing them with appropriate opportunities within IAC and its businesses and (iii) help foster a diverse and entrepreneurial culture across our various businesses.
In order to achieves these objectives, we believe that we must continue to provide competitive compensation packages and otherwise incentivize employees in unique and attractive ways, as well as develop and promote talent from within and remain committed to building inclusive workplaces and workforces that reflect the diversity of the global population using our products and services each day.
As of December 31, 2020, IAC had approximately 8,200 employees, substantially all of which were full-time employees and the substantial majority of which were based in the United States.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe that we must continue to provide competitive compensation packages and other benefits to our workforce. While compensation packages vary across IAC and our various businesses, compensation packages generally consist of base salary (plus commissions in the case of sales and other similar positions) and annual cash bonuses (on a discretionary basis), and equity or equity-based awards.
We also provide comprehensive health, welfare and retirement benefits. Healthcare benefits are significantly subsidized by the Company and the coverage provided reflects our commitment to inclusivity and the physical and mental well-being of all employees.
In the case of welfare benefits, we maintain generous paid time off and paid leave policies across our businesses and offer subsidized backup child and elder care for our employees. We believe in giving back to the causes and charities that are important to our employees and match charitable contributions made by our employees to qualifying charities on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to an annual cap per employee. We also encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and work and provide our employees with paid time off each year to volunteer for charitable and community service projects.
In the case of retirement benefits, in the U.S., we offer our employees a retirement savings program with employer contributions that are among the most generous in our industry. Specifically, for U.S. full-time employees, we match all pre-tax contributions to IAC’s 401(k) plan, as well as post-tax contributions to Roth individual retirement accounts, dollar for dollar in an amount of up to 10% of an employee’s eligible compensation (subject to an annual cap). We believe that we have a responsibility to encourage, and contribute to, the retirement readiness of each of our employees, and believes that this generous 401(k) match is a meaningful commitment to the long-term welfare and security of our workforce.
Talent Development
We generally develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. As a result, senior management across the Company and our businesses generally possesses a great depth of knowledge and experience regarding the Company and our businesses, which is critical for effective succession planning, and with external hires providing a fresh perspective. The human resources teams across the Company and our businesses use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled, talented and diverse employees, and employee referrals for open positions are encouraged.
In addition, we actively seek to identify the next generation of leaders in technology early and often through the IAC Fellows program, a first-of-its-kind program connecting students from under-served and under-resourced backgrounds with academic and leadership opportunities. IAC Fellows join the program as early as high school and stay for up to six years, rotating across a diverse set of IAC businesses during that time in the form of competitively paid internships that put IAC Fellows in the trenches, testing their skills in real world scenarios. Through these experiences, IAC Fellows gain exposure to different business models, functions and roles within IAC, as well as access to IAC senior leadership as mentors and coaches. IAC Fellows also receive an academic stipend following the completion of each paid internship. If an IAC Fellow is hired by IAC or any of its businesses following the completion of his or her paid internships and stay for a period of three years, IAC will pay off his or her school loans in their entirety.
To be eligible for the IAC Fellows program, students must be from low-income backgrounds or families with financial need, with eligibility assessed individually based on the composition and income of a given student’s family, and with first-generation college students being given priority consideration. Students must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. and possess the following personal attributes: (i) leadership abilities, (ii) a strong interest in science, technology, computer science and/or math, (iii) demonstrated intellectual curiosity and devotion to study, (iv) a hunger to learn and achieve academically and (v) ethics, integrity and strength of character.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building inclusive workplaces and workforces that reflect the diversity of the global population using our products and services each day. Accordingly, we view diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts as integral to our success. While DE&I efforts, policies and practices vary across our businesses, they include (in addition to the IAC Fellows program discussed above) at certain of our businesses: (i) pay equity analyses conducted on an annual basis to ensure that employees from traditionally under-represented groups are not adversely impacted by pay bias, (ii) employee community 
resource groups (ECGs) led and supported by senior executives (and in certain cases, funded by the relevant business), (iii) incentivizing DE&I by tying bonus structure to diversity goals and metrics and (iv) launching DE&I councils at certain of our businesses that collaborate directly with senior executives to roll out DE&I training, as well to determine ways to diversify product and service experiences, attract a more diverse population of employees and invest in building diverse and equitable local communities.
