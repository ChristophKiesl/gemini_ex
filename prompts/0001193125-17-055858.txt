Strategy 
 We intend to leverage our core strengths, including our advantaged geographic footprint, market leadership positions and portfolio of iconic brands and innovation platforms, to achieve three primary goals of growing our people, growing our business and growing our impact. 

 | Grow our People: We hire and inspire our people to engage in challenging and rewarding career experiences and to contribute their talent to create a great place to work. We collaborate globally, scale ideas quickly and develop world-class capabilities. Our culture is fast-moving, bold, innovative and accountable, reflecting the traits and skills necessary to thrive in a competitive global marketplace. To support and build on the success of our people in a continually-evolving business environment, we invest in our people and their development, foster respect for one another, celebrate diversity and commit to authenticity at every level. We also work to create an environment in which our people can demonstrate innovative and courageous leadership to make a difference in every role they play in the Company. As reflected in our actions and our investments in our people, we value their contributions and are committed to their success.

 | Grow our Business: We aim to deliver strong, profitable long-term growth by accelerating our core snacks business and expanding the reach of our Power Brands globally. Leveraging our Power brands  including Oreo, LU and belVita biscuits; Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Toblerone chocolate; Trident gum and Halls candy  and our innovation platforms, we plan to innovate boldly and connect with our consumers wherever they are, including new markets around the world, using both traditional and digital channels. As consumer consumption patterns change to more accessible, frequent and better-for-you snacking, we are enhancing the goodness of many of our brands (including providing simpler and wholesome ingredient-focused snacks), expanding the well-being offerings in our portfolio and inspiring consumers to snack mindfully by providing clear and simple nutrition information. As shopping expands further online, we are also working to grow our e-commerce platform and on-line presence with consumers. To fuel these investments, we have been working to optimize our cost structure. These efforts include reinventing our supply chain, including adding and upgrading to more efficient production lines, while reducing the complexity of our product offerings, ingredients and number of suppliers. We also continue to aggressively manage our overhead costs. We have embraced and embedded zero-based budgeting practices across the organization to identify potential areas of cost reductions and capture and sustain savings within our ongoing operating budgets. Through these actions, were leveraging our brands, platforms and capabilities to drive long-term value and return on investment for our shareholders.

 | Grow our Impact: Our growth is linked to enhancing the well-being of the people who make and enjoy our products, the communities we serve and the planet and its limited resources. As consumers seek foods that taste delicious and match their lifestyle goals, we are committed to meeting their well-being needs by becoming a leader in tasty, accessible, well-being snacks. To ensure the safety of our people, we have implemented world-class safety programs, workplace wellness programs and policies to promote fair and equal treatment. We conduct business in compliance with the law, our company policies and accepted standards of business conduct. We also seek to improve consumers well-being by providing innovative community programs focused on learning about food choices, preparing healthy meals, growing nutritious foods and encouraging children to play. We encourage our people to contribute time and talent to community programs, and we provide humanitarian aid to communities in times of need. We also leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes.

Reportable Segments 
 Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments: 
 
 | Latin America
--+--------------


 | Asia, Middle East, and Africa (AMEA)
--+---------------------------------------


 | Europe
--+-------


 | North America
--+--------------

 On October 1, 2016, we integrated our Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) operating segment into our Europe and Asia Pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were combined within our Europe region, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Pacific region to form the AMEA operating segment. We have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented. 
 
2 
 
We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. 
 We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. For a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pre-tax earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 16, Segment Reporting. 
 Our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were: 
 
 
 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | | 2014
 | (in millions) | 
Net revenues: | | | | | | | |

 | $ | 3,122 | | 100.0% | | $ | 3,329 | | 100.0% | $ | 3,879 | 100.0%

 The deconsolidation of our global coffee business in 2015, the deconsolidation of our Venezuela operations beginning with our 2016 results, currency and other items significantly affect the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results from year to year. Please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a review of our operating results. 
 Our brands span five product categories: 
 
 | Biscuits (including cookies, crackers and salted snacks)

 | Gum & candy
--+------------


 | Beverages (including coffee through July 2, 2015 and powdered beverages)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cheese & grocery
--+-----------------

 During 2016, our segments contributed to our net revenues in the following product categories: 
 
 
 | Percentage of 2016 Net Revenues by Product Category | 
 | | | | | Gum & | | Cheese & | | 
Segment | Biscuits | | Chocolate | | Candy | Beverages | Grocery | | Total

Significant Divestitures and Acquisitions 
 For information on our significant divestitures and acquisitions, please refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and specifically, in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation, see the discussions under JDE Coffee Business Transactions and Keurig Transaction. 
 Customers 
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2016. Our five largest customers accounted for 16.6% and our ten largest customers accounted for 22.9% of net revenues from continuing operations in 2016. 
Seasonality 
 Demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events. Depending on when Easter falls, there may also be a shift between the first and second quarter results. We build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material. Funding for working capital items, including inventory and receivables, is normally sourced from operating cash flows and short-term commercial paper borrowings. For additional information on our liquidity, working capital management, cash flow and financing activities, see Liquidity and Capital Resources, Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, appearing later in this 10-K filing. 
 Competition 
 We face competition in all aspects of our business. Competitors include large multi-national as well as numerous local and regional companies. Some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently. We compete based on product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, service, product innovation, taste, convenience, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, effectiveness of sales and marketing, routes to market and distribution networks, promotional activity and price. Improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research, development, advertising and promotional expenditures. We believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position. 
Distribution and Marketing 
 Across our segments, we generally sell our products to supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, club stores, mass merchandisers, distributors, convenience stores, gasoline stations, drug stores, value stores and other retail food outlets. We distribute our products through direct store delivery, company-owned and satellite warehouses, distribution centers and other facilities. We use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations. 
 We also sell our products on a growing number of e-commerce platforms as consumer consumption patterns change (reflecting greater consumer time compression and technology use) and retail increasingly expands online. Within our digital and social marketing, we create opportunities for consumers to easily find and buy our products online. We have built relationships with several retailers to develop customized programs that fit their and our formats and provide consumers additional personalized offerings from our snacks portfolio. 
 
4 
 
We conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities: (i) consumer marketing and advertising including on-air, print, outdoor, digital and social media and other product promotions; (ii) consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (iii) trade promotions to support price features, displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers. 
 Raw Materials and Packaging 
 We purchase and use large quantities of commodities, including cocoa, dairy, wheat, corn products, palm and other vegetable oils, sugar and other sweeteners and nuts. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses. We monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. 
 A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. 
 While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources. For additional information on our commodity costs, refer to the Commodity Trends section within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how) are material to our business. 
 We own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained. Trademark registrations generally are for renewable, fixed terms. We also have patents for a number of current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. While our patent portfolio is material to our business, the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 From time to time, we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of third party products. Similarly, we sell some products under brands we license from third parties. In our agreement with Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (Kraft Foods Group, which is now part of The Kraft Heinz Company), we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spin-off of our North American grocery business. 
 Research and Development 
 We pursue four objectives in research and development: product safety and quality, growth through new products, superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs. Our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends. Wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives. These initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms, Power Brands and breakthrough technologies. In September 2016, we announced our plan to invest $65 million over 2017-2018 to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities. We are focusing our technical resources at nine large locations to drive global growth and innovation. These global hubs will enable greater effectiveness, improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery. These locations are in Curitiba, Brazil; Suzhou, China; Thane, India; Mexico City, Mexico; East Hanover, New Jersey; Wroclaw, Poland; Jurong, Singapore; Bournville, United Kingdom and Reading, United Kingdom. 
 
5 
 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,550 scientists and engineers, of which approximately 1,950 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs. Our research and development expense was $376 million in 2016, $409 million in 2015 and $455 million in 2014. Our total research and development expense was lower in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our global coffee business in July 2015, currency and cost optimization initiatives. 
 Regulation 
 Our food products and ingredients are subject to local, national and multi-national regulations related to labeling, packaging, pricing, marketing and advertising, privacy and related areas. In addition, various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities, enforcing standards for selected food products, grading food products, and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products. Many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention, and the scrutiny of human rights issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries. These policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review. 
 Examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes, labeling requirements such as nutrient profiling, marketing restrictions, potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials. We will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations. At this time, we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material. Also refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Currency Translation and Highly Inflationary Accounting, for additional information on government regulations and currency-related impacts on our operations in the United Kingdom, Argentina and other countries. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 Throughout the countries in which we do business, we are subject to local, national and multi-national environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Based on information currently available, we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results. 
Sustainability 
 A key strategic goal for us is to Grow our Impact, and we seek to do that in part by sourcing our products sustainably, reducing the environmental impact of our operations and packaging, and being mindful of the limited resources available around the world. We continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes, focusing on where we can make the most impact. For example, we have taken direct accountability for building a sustainable cocoa supply with our $400 million Cocoa Life program. And were improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in North America and through our Harmony program in Europe. 
 Our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an end-to-end approach to reduce our carbon footprint, including reducing our absolute CO2 emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains. We are also working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing, focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce, and we are working to reduce waste in manufacturing and packaging. 
 We have been recognized for our ongoing economic, environmental and social contributions and this year were listed again on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)  World and North American Indices. The DJSI selects the top 10% of global companies and top 20% of North American companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry. We improved our overall score to reach the 95th percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in health and nutrition, raw material sourcing and water-related risks. 
 
6 
 
We also participate in the CDP Climate and Water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water footprints. We ranked 4th in the Access to Nutrition Index, a global index that assesses and ranks the worlds largest food and beverage companies on their nutrition-related commitments, practices and performance. We are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture, mindful snacking, community partnerships and safety of our products and people. 
 Employees 
 We employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately 90,000 people worldwide at December 31, 2016 and approximately 99,000 at December 31, 2015. Employees represented by labor unions or workers councils represent approximately 65% of our 78,000 employees outside the United States and approximately 28% of our 12,000 U.S. employees. Our business units are subject to various local, national and multi-national laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. In accordance with European Union requirements, we also have established a European Workers Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce. We or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. 
International Operations 
 Based on where we sell our products, we generated 75.6% of our 2016 net revenues, 78.7% of our 2015 net revenues and 82.1% of our 2014 net revenues from continuing operations outside the United States. We sell our products to consumers in approximately 165 countries. At December 31, 2016, we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 150 manufacturing and processing facilities in 52 countries. Refer to Note 16, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Refer to Item 2, Properties, for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities. Also, for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the United States, see Risk Factors in Item 1A.

Ethics and Governance 
 We adopted the Mondelēz International Code of Conduct, which qualifies as a code of ethics under Item 406 of Regulation S-K. The code applies to all of our employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. Our code of ethics is available free of charge on our web site at www.mondelezinternational.com and will be provided free of charge to any shareholder submitting a written request to: Corporate Secretary, Mondelēz International, Inc., Three Parkway North, Deerfield, IL 60015.
