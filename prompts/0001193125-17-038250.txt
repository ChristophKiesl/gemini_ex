OVERVIEW 
 MEDNAX is a leading provider of physician services including newborn, anesthesia, maternal-fetal, teleradiology, pediatric cardiology and other pediatric subspecialty care. At December 31, 2016, our national network comprised over 3,600 affiliated physicians, including over 1,130 physicians who provide neonatal clinical care, in 35 states and Puerto Rico, primarily within hospital-based neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), to babies born prematurely or with medical complications. We have over 1,390 affiliated physicians who provide anesthesia care to patients in connection with surgical and other procedures, as well as pain management. In addition, we have 270 affiliated physicians who provide maternal-fetal and obstetrical medical care to expectant mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies primarily in areas where our affiliated neonatal physicians practice. Our network also includes other pediatric subspecialists, including over 150 physicians providing pediatric intensive care, approximately 130 physicians providing pediatric cardiology care, 115 physicians providing hospital-based pediatric care, over 20 physicians providing pediatric surgical care, and 7 physicians providing pediatric ear, nose and throat and pediatric ophthalmology services. MEDNAX also provides teleradiology services in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through a network of more than 400 affiliated radiologists. In addition to our national physician network, we provide services nationwide to healthcare facilities and physicians, including ours, through complementary businesses, consisting of a management services organization focusing on full-service revenue cycle management and a consulting services company. 
 MEDNAX, Inc. was incorporated in Florida in 2007 and is the successor to Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc., which was incorporated in Florida in 1979. Our principal executive offices are located at 1301 Concord Terrace, Sunrise, Florida 33323 and our telephone number is (954) 384-0175.
OUR PHYSICIAN SPECIALTIES AND SERVICES 
 The following discussion describes our physician specialties and the care that we provide: 
 Neonatal Care 
 We provide clinical care to babies born prematurely or with complications within specific units at hospitals, primarily NICUs, through our network of over 1,130 affiliated neonatal physician subspecialists (neonatologists), neonatal nurse practitioners and other pediatric clinicians who staff and manage clinical activities at more than 370 NICUs in 35 states and Puerto Rico. Neonatologists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, physicians who have extensive education and training for the care of babies born prematurely or with complications that require complex medical treatment. Neonatal nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have advanced training and education in assessing and treating the healthcare needs of newborns and infants as well as managing the needs of their families. 
 We partner with our hospital clients in an effort to enhance the quality of care delivered to premature and sick babies. Some of the nations largest and most prestigious hospitals, including both not-for-profit and 
 
3 
 
 for-profit institutions, retain us to staff and manage their NICUs. Our affiliated neonatologists generally provide 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week coverage in NICUs, support the local referring physician community and are available for consultation in other hospital departments. Our hospital partners benefit from our experience in managing complex intensive care units. Our neonatal physicians interact with colleagues across the country through an internal communications system to draw upon their collective expertise in managing challenging patient-care issues. Our neonatal physicians also work collaboratively with maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists to coordinate the care of mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies and their fetuses. 
 Anesthesia and Anesthesia Subspecialty Care 
 We provide anesthesia care at over 145 hospitals, 150 ambulatory surgery centers and office-based practices across 15 states with over 1,390 affiliated anesthesiologists. Following the care team model, our anesthesiologists work with both practice and hospital-employed certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), anesthesiologist assistants (AAs) and other clinicians to provide high quality, cost efficient and service-oriented anesthesia care to our patients. Our anesthesiologists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, physicians who are responsible for administering anesthesia to relieve pain and for managing vital life functions during surgery, including breathing, heart rhythm and blood pressure. 
 As an integral part of the surgical team, our affiliated anesthesiologists support the surgeons by providing medical care before, during and after surgery so that surgeons may concentrate on the surgical procedure. Our affiliated anesthesiologists provide this care by evaluating the patient and consulting with the surgical team before surgery, providing pain control and support of life functions during surgery, supervising care after surgery by maintaining the patient in a comfortable state during recovery and discharging the patient from the post-anesthesia care unit. They also support other departments within the hospital such as labor and delivery, imaging and the hospitals emergency room. In addition to their board certification in anesthesiology, many of our affiliated anesthesiologists have completed fellowships in subspecialties such as obstetrical, critical care, cardiac and pediatric anesthesia. 
 Pain Management 
 We also provide acute and chronic pain management services in over 30 pain management centers through our network of physicians and physician assistants. Our physicians are board-certified in anesthesiology or neurology and board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, in pain medicine. This advanced training and education expands treatment options available for both acute and chronic pain sufferers. The physicians develop treatment plans specific to the patients individual needs that include interventional techniques such as trigger point and facet injections, pain pumps, nerve stimulators, radiofrequency ablation and catheters, as well as medication management. 
 Maternal-Fetal Care 
 We provide inpatient and office-based clinical care to expectant mothers and their unborn babies through our 270 affiliated maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists as well as obstetricians and other clinicians, such as maternal-fetal nurse practitioners, certified nurse mid-wives, ultrasonographers and genetic counselors. Maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, obstetricians who have extensive education and training for the treatment of high-risk expectant mothers and their fetuses. Our affiliated maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists practice primarily in metropolitan areas where we have affiliated neonatologists to provide coordinated care for women with complicated pregnancies whose babies are often admitted to a NICU upon delivery. We believe continuity of treatment from mother and developing fetus during the pregnancy to the newborn upon delivery has improved the clinical outcomes of our patients. 
 Pediatric Cardiology Care 
 We provide inpatient and office-based pediatric cardiology care of the fetus, infant, child and adolescent patient with congenital heart defects and acquired heart disease, as well as adults with congenital heart defects 
 
4 
 
 through our 130 affiliated pediatric cardiologist subspecialists and other related clinical professionals such as pediatric nurse practitioners, echocardiographers, other diagnostic technicians, and exercise physiologists. Pediatric cardiologists are board-certified, or eligible-to-apply for certification, pediatricians who have additional education and training in congenital heart defects and pediatric acquired heart disorders. 
 We provide specialized cardiac care to the fetus, neonatal and pediatric patients with congenital and acquired heart disorders, as well as adults with congenital heart defects, through scheduled office visits, hospital rounds and immediate consultation in emergency situations. Our affiliated pediatric cardiologists work collaboratively with neonatologists and maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists to provide a coordinated continuum of care. 
 Other Pediatric Subspecialty Care 
 Our network includes other pediatric subspecialists such as pediatric intensivists, pediatric hospitalists, pediatric surgeons and pediatric ear, nose and throat physicians. In addition, our affiliated physicians seek to provide support services in other areas of hospitals, particularly in the pediatric emergency room, labor and delivery area, and nursery and pediatric departments, where immediate accessibility to specialized care may be critical. 
 Pediatric Intensive Care. Pediatric intensivists are hospital-based pediatricians with additional education and training in caring for critically ill or injured children and adolescents. We have over 150 affiliated physicians who provide this clinical care. They staff and manage pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) at approximately 55 hospitals. 
 Pediatric Hospitalists. Pediatric hospitalists are hospital-based pediatricians specializing in inpatient care and management of acutely ill children. We have over 115 affiliated hospital-based physicians who provide inpatient pediatric and newborn care as well as provide care in PICUs, NICUs and pediatric emergency rooms at approximately 35 hospitals. 
 Pediatric Surgery. Pediatric surgeons provide specialized care for patients ranging from newborns to adolescents, for all problems or conditions that require surgical intervention, and often have particular expertise in the areas of neonatal, prenatal, trauma, and pediatric oncology. We have over 20 affiliated physicians in this subspecialty including pediatric urologists, pediatric plastic and craniofacial surgeons and general and thoracic pediatric surgeons. Areas of particular expertise include management of neonatal and congenital anomalies, prenatal counseling, trauma management, pediatric oncology, gastrointestinal surgery, as well as common pediatric surgical conditions. 
 Other Newborn and Pediatric Care. Because our affiliated physicians and advanced nurse practitioners generally provide hospital-based coverage, they are situated to provide highly specialized care to address medical needs that may arise during a babys hospitalization. For example, as part of our ongoing efforts to support and partner with hospitals and the local referring physician community, our affiliated neonatologists, pediatric hospitalists and advanced nurse practitioners provide in-hospital nursery care to newborns through our newborn nursery program. This program is made available for babies during their hospital stay, which in the case of healthy babies typically consists of evaluation and observation, following which they are referred, and their hospital records are provided, to their pediatricians or family practitioners for follow-up care. 
 Newborn Hearing Screening Program. Our affiliated physicians also oversee our newborn hearing screening program. Since we launched this program in 1994, we believe that we have become the largest provider of newborn hearing screening services in the United States. In 2016, we screened over 860,000 babies for potential hearing loss at more than 370 hospitals across the nation. Over 40 states either require newborns to be screened for potential hearing loss before being discharged from the hospital or require that parents be offered the opportunity to submit their newborns to hearing screens. We contract or coordinate with hospitals to provide newborn hearing screening services. 
 
5 
 
Radiology 
 Teleradiology. Teleradiology represents a component of the broader radiology industry. We provide teleradiology services to over 2,100 client hospitals, health systems and radiology groups across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. With over 400 U.S. board-certified and eligible radiologists currently reading images in the network, over 75% of whom are subspecialty trained, we are able to interpret over 6 million patient studies annually and process over 1.9 billion images on what we believe is the worlds largest and most advanced picture archiving and communication system (PACS). We believe that the teleradiology specialty is poised for growth and that there are numerous opportunities for cross-selling vRads services within MEDNAXs existing customer base. 
 Radiology Physician Group Practices. We also believe that teleradiology will play a significant role in the practice of radiology in the future, and that our teleradiology services business will be a valuable asset to us as we move down the path of building a broader radiology business through the acquisition of radiology physician group practices. We believe that we bring a unique value proposition to radiology physician groups, in that we can provide not only practice support, but also teleradiology capabilities that can enhance their efficiency, provide subspecialty access and help them grow and remain competitive. In addition, we believe that radiology physician group practice physicians can complement the staffing needs for our teleradiology services business during certain times, such as nights and weekends, when they are not providing services at their practices. 
Management Services Organization and Consulting Services 
 In addition to our national physician network, we provide services nationwide to healthcare facilities and physicians, including ours, through complementary businesses, consisting of a management services organization that specializes in full-service revenue cycle management and patient/physician connectivity software as well as consulting services company. Our management services organization provides a suite of solutions including a range of patient access and communications, full-service revenue cycle management, consulting and analytics services, billing and coding, patient responsibility, eligibility and disability, complex accounts receivable services such as workers compensation, out-of-state Medicaid eligibility and more, and mobile-first engagement and communication software for patients and providers. We provide these services to approximately 2,000 hospitals and other healthcare providers nationwide. 
 Our perioperative consulting company is comprised of a collaborative team of anesthesiologists, operating room nurse executives and perioperative business strategists who develop and provide solutions to streamline patient throughput, enhance anesthesia service levels, increase surgeon and patient satisfaction, decrease costs and implement strategic perioperative growth plans to hospitals and health systems. 
 Clinical Research and Quality 
 As part of our ongoing commitment to improving patient care through evidence-based medicine, we also conduct clinical research, monitor clinical outcomes and implement clinical quality initiatives with a view to improving patient outcomes, shortening the length of hospital stays and reducing long-term health system costs. Our physician-centric approach to clinical research and continuous quality improvement has demonstrated improvements in clinical outcomes, while reducing the costs of care associated with complications as well as variability in protocols. We believe that referring and collaborating physicians, hospitals, third-party payors and patients all benefit from our clinical research, education and quality initiatives. 
DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES 
 Hospital-Based Care. Hospitals generally must provide cost-effective, quality care in order to enhance their reputations within their communities and desirability to patients, referring and collaborating physicians and third-party payors. In an effort to improve outcomes and manage costs, hospitals typically employ or contract with 
 
6 
 
 physician specialists to provide specialized care in many hospital-based units or settings. Hospitals traditionally staff these units or settings through affiliations with local physician groups or independent practitioners. However, management of these units and settings presents significant operational challenges, including variable admissions rates, increased operating costs, complex reimbursement systems and other administrative burdens. As a result, some hospitals choose to contract with physician organizations that have the clinical quality initiatives, information and reimbursement systems and management expertise required to effectively and efficiently operate these units and settings in the current healthcare environment. Demand for hospital-based physician services, including neonatology and anesthesiology, is determined by a national market in which qualified physicians with advanced training compete for hospital contracts. 
 Neonatal Medicine. Of the approximately 4 million births in the United States annually, we estimate that approximately 14% require NICU admission. Numerous institutions conduct research to identify potential causes of premature birth and medical complications that often require NICU admission. Some common contributing factors include the presence of hypertension or diabetes in the mother, lack of prenatal care, complications during pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and smoking or poor nutritional habits during pregnancy. Babies admitted to NICUs typically have an illness or condition that requires the care of a neonatologist. Babies who are born prematurely or have a low birth weight often require neonatal intensive care services because of an increased risk for medical complications. We believe obstetricians generally prefer to perform deliveries at hospitals that provide a full complement of labor and delivery services, including a NICU staffed by board-certified, or eligible-to-apply-for-certification, neonatologists. Because obstetrics is a significant source of hospital admissions, hospital administrators have responded to these demands by establishing NICUs and contracting with independent neonatology group practices, such as our affiliated professional contractors, to staff and manage these units. As a result, NICUs within the United States tend to be concentrated in hospitals with higher volumes of births. There are approximately 5,300 board-certified neonatologists in the United States. 
 Anesthesia Medicine. An estimated 50 million inpatient procedures and 35 million ambulatory procedures are performed annually in the United States. Anesthesiologists generally provide or participate in the administration of anesthetics in these procedures. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population continues to expand and the fastest-growing segment of the population consists of individuals over the age of 65. The growth in population and, in particular the age 65 or greater segment, has resulted in an increase in demand for surgical services and a correlating increase in demand for anesthesia services. The growth of ambulatory surgical centers and expansion of office-based procedures has also contributed to the demand for anesthesia providers. There are approximately 51,000 board certified/eligible anesthesiologists in the United States. 
 Pain Management. According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, more than 75 million people suffer from pain and 15% of those who suffer from pain will consult with a pain specialist. As the population ages, we believe that the number of people suffering from acute or chronic pain will continue to increase. Lifestyle also plays an important part in the demand for pain management services. We believe that the combination of the growing population of people who suffer from pain, the lifestyle expectations of this population and the ability for patients to seek out a pain specialist without having to be referred by a physician will increase the demand for pain management services. 
 Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Expectant mothers with pregnancy complications often seek or are referred by their obstetricians to maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists. These subspecialists provide inpatient and office-based care to women with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, multiple gestation, recurrent miscarriage, family history of genetic diseases, suspected fetal birth defects and other complications during their pregnancies. We believe that improved maternal-fetal care has a positive impact on neonatal outcomes. Data on neonatal outcomes demonstrates that, in general, the likelihood of mortality or an adverse condition or outcome (referred to as morbidity) is reduced the longer a baby remains in the womb. There are approximately 2,100 board-certified maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists in the United States. 
 Pediatric Cardiology Medicine. Pediatric cardiologists provide inpatient and office-based cardiology care of the fetus, infant, child, and adolescent with congenital heart defects and acquired heart disease, as well as 
 
7 
 
 providing care to adults with congenital heart defects. We estimate that approximately one in every 110 babies is born with some form of heart defect. With advancements in care, there are approximately 1.4 million adults in the United States today living with congenital heart disease. There are approximately 2,300 board-certified pediatric cardiologists in the United States. 
 Other Pediatric Subspecialty Medicine. Other areas of pediatric subspecialty medicine are closely associated with maternal-fetal-newborn medical care. For example, pediatric intensivists are subspecialists who care for critically ill or injured children and adolescents in PICUs. There are approximately 1,800 board-certified pediatric intensivists in the United States. As another example, pediatric hospitalists are pediatricians who provide care in many hospital areas, including labor and delivery and the newborn nursery. In addition, pediatric surgeons provide specialized care for patients ranging from newborns to adolescents, for all problems or conditions affecting children that require surgical intervention, and often have particular expertise in the areas of neonatal, prenatal, trauma, and pediatric oncology. There are approximately 900 board-certified pediatric surgeons in the United States. 
 Teleradiology and Telemedicine. Teleradiology represents a component of the broader radiology industry, which comprises roughly 27,000 radiologists in the United States and total U.S. radiology revenue of approximately $18.0 billion. Within this market, teleradiology is a fast growing segment of the physician services sector. According to Transparency Market Research, the U.S. teleradiology market is expected to grow significantly over the course of the next few years, growing from a $672 million market in 2016 to a $1.2 billion market in 2019. 
 We believe that there are several factors prompting the shift from traditional onsite radiology services to the teleradiology model. Around-the-clock subspecialty coverage is becoming a standard of care; the idea that a general radiologist practicing in a single hospital has the ability to read all types of images is no longer prevalent. On behalf of their patients, healthcare facilities increasingly seek to have diagnostic images evaluated by radiologists who have expertise in specific subspecialty areas such as neuroradiology, cardiac imaging and trauma imaging. In addition, facilities wish to have this subspecialty service available to them immediately because timing is critical for treatment and recovery. Advances in technology now make this around-the clock expert attention possible; using remote/onsite integration and data analytics, teleradiologists can read diagnostic images from anywhere at any time and seamlessly deliver results. This not only provides the ability to determine optimal treatment decisions for the patient, but also enhances a healthcare facilitys ability to efficiently and effectively meet its patients needs. Since most teleradiology work is completed remotely, the pool of qualified radiologists who are subspecialty trained is significantly greater than would be available in a single geographic area. 
 Another key driver, we believe, is how we support forward-thinking radiology groups that are attempting to become high-performance providers in their markets. Traditionally, radiology groups have had to staff to their peak volume creating periods where they are overstaffed as volume ramps up or down. With us as a partner, radiology groups can staff to meet typical demand, as opposed to overstaffing, and leverage our solutions for additional coverage at all times, not just the overnight hours. Similarly, teleradiology coverage can be provided for other physician group staffing challenges such as physician retirement and attrition, or to provide expertise in specific subspecialty areas that may not be covered by the physicians in the practice. 
 Further, we believe there are broader applications across the larger telemedicine industry for the use of the proprietary technology and workflow platform utilized within our teleradiology business. Telemedicine services are well documented as high quality, safe and efficient means of expanding physician services into metropolitan and rural communities. We have begun to expand our services to provide these remote programs to our hospital partners and believe that this will become more relevant as more healthcare providers integrate remote healthcare solutions into their healthcare practices. 
 Physician Practice Administration. Administrative demands and cost containment pressures from a number of sources, principally commercial and government payors, make it increasingly difficult for physicians to 
 
8 
 
 effectively manage patient care, remain current on the latest procedures and efficiently administer non-clinical activities. As a result, we believe that physicians remain receptive to being affiliated with larger organizations that reduce administrative burdens, achieve economies of scale and provide value-added clinical research, education and quality initiatives. By relieving many of the burdens associated with the management of a subspecialty group practice, we believe that our practice administration services permit our affiliated physicians to focus on providing quality patient care and thereby contribute to improving patient outcomes, ensuring appropriate length of hospital stays and reducing long-term health system costs. In addition, our national network of affiliated physician practices, modeled around a traditional group practice structure, is managed by a non-clinical professional management team with proven abilities to achieve significant operating efficiencies in providing administrative support systems, interacting with physicians, hospitals and third-party payors, managing information systems and technologies, and complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
 Management Services / Full-Service Revenue Cycle Management. Our management services organization is designed to help physicians and other healthcare providers better engage patients throughout the entire healthcare continuum by addressing the various challenges that they face from the complexity or reimbursement and practice coordination in todays healthcare environment. We believe our suite of solutions sets our management services organization apart in the world of healthcare revenue cycle management. Our suite of solutions includes a range of patient access and communications, revenue cycle management, consulting and analytics services, billing and coding, patient responsibility, eligibility and disability, complex accounts receivable services such as workers compensation, out-of-state and more, and mobile-first engagement and communication software for patients and providers. By allowing our organization to step in and handle these areas, hospitals and other healthcare providers can focus on providing care to their patients without the administrative burdens. 
 The healthcare landscape is changing rapidly, particularly in various areas that hospitals and other healthcare providers typically have not invested in. Our solutions become even more relevant in these specific areas. For example, as patient responsibility balances continue to grow and become harder to collect, our management services organizations unique process of patient outreach and communication, before the healthcare bills are even sent, is a proven solution to this problem that also enhances patient satisfaction. Our management services organization also helps hospitals and other healthcare providers streamline the eligibility process for Medicaid. Medicaid eligibility is not a simple process to establish, as it is different across all states and must be reestablished monthly, and is a critical function as there are millions of individuals who are eligible for Medicaid. We believe that our solutions have been positively received by our hospital and other healthcare partners, and add to the value proposition that we can deliver to address the key areas where hospitals and other healthcare providers must adapt to the changes in the business of healthcare. 
 OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 Our business objective is to enhance our position as a leading provider of physician and other complementary healthcare services. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are: 

 | Build upon core competencies. We have developed significant administrative expertise relating to our practice physician services. We have also facilitated the development of a clinical approach to the practice of medicine among our affiliated physicians through clinical data warehouses that include research, education and quality initiatives intended to advance the practice of medicine and care, improve the quality of care provided to our patients and reduce long-term health system costs. Analysis of the data within our clinical data warehouses across our neonatology, anesthesia and other pediatric subspecialty services allows us to provide feedback to our physicians and hospital partners and to develop and implement best practices, all with the goal of improving outcomes, creating efficiencies and ensuring patient satisfaction. As healthcare organizations are expected to increasingly be held accountable for the quality and cost of the care they provide, we believe that our ability to capture this data within our clinical data warehouses adds value to our patients and our hospital and physician partners.

9 
 

 | Promote same-unit and organic growth. We seek opportunities for increasing revenue from our hospital- and office-based operations. For example, our affiliated hospital-based neonatal, maternal-fetal and other pediatric physicians are well situated to, and, in some cases, provide physician services in other departments, such as pediatric emergency rooms, newborn nurseries, or in situations where immediate accessibility to specialized obstetric and pediatric care may be critical. Our hospital-based and office-based physicians continue to pursue an organic growth strategy that involves working with our hospital partners to develop integrated service programs for which we become a provider of solutions across the maternal-fetal, newborn, pediatric continuum of care. An integrated program results in a broader offering of care across our specialties and permits the extension of our service lines in our markets. We have successfully executed this organic growth strategy and market partnership in many metropolitan areas and intend to continue this growth initiative in the future. In addition, we market our capabilities to obstetricians, pediatricians and family physicians to attract referrals to our hospital-based units and our office-based practices. We also market the services of our affiliated physicians to other hospitals to attract maternal, neonatal and pediatric transport admissions. In addition, we may pursue new contractual arrangements with hospitals, including possibly through joint ventures, either where we currently provide or do not currently provide physician services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A more recent program that we have had success developing relates to obstetric hospitalists (OB hospitalists). We have collaborated with hospitals to design programs for which an OB hospitalist is on site at the hospital on a shift basis to provide care for laboring patients and managing obstetrical emergencies. We believe this program is valuable to our hospital partners as the program improves patient safety in part by preventing unattended deliveries and allowing for swifter emergency treatment. An additional benefit from such a program for our hospital partners is that local obstetricians unable to attend deliveries can be confident that there are dedicated in-house obstetricians available to attend such deliveries, and they may therefore choose to deliver at hospitals with such programs. 
 We also continue to expand our services in telemedicine, which is the use of telecommunication and information technology in order to provide clinical healthcare at a distance. Our 2015 acquisition of vRad was a significant milestone in this rapidly evolving area of healthcare and provided us with vRads proprietary technology and workflow platform. Similarly, we expect that many pediatric subspecialties as well as maternal-fetal medicine, will benefit in the future from having a robust platform in telemedicine. Telemedicine services are well documented as high quality, safe and efficient means of expanding physician services into metropolitan and rural communities. We have begun to expand our services to provide these remote programs to our hospital partners. These programs enhance the standing of our hospital partners while creating another portal of entry of pediatric patients to our inpatient service lines. 
 Additionally, with the goal of further expanding our organic growth strategy, we are continuing the evolving process of creating and developing a national sales team to pursue opportunities across our service lines. This sales team will work with existing hospital and other healthcare partners and will also focus on building new relationships with hospitals and other service providers to which we do not currently provide services in order to offer clinical and other solutions and respond to requests for proposals. The ultimate goal is for MEDNAX to be viewed by hospitals and other partners as a multi-specialty health solutions partner and other complementary services solutions provider across all of our service lines. 
 

 | Acquire physician practice groups. We continue to seek to expand our operations by acquiring established physician practices in our specialties which include neonatology, anesthesiology, maternal-fetal medicine and pediatric cardiology. We also pursue complementary pediatric subspecialty physician groups, such as pediatric intensivists, pediatric hospitalists, pediatric surgeons, pediatric ear, nose and throat physicians and pediatric ophthalmologists. In addition, both independently and in collaboration with our hospital partners, we are actively pursuing expansion into additional pediatric subspecialties in order to meet the needs of our hospital partners. These include groups with expertise in pediatric orthopedics and neurosurgery as well as newborn congenital heart disease. During 2016,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10 
 

we added 13 physician groups to our national network through acquisitions consisting of eight anesthesiology practices, two other pediatric subspecialty practices, one neonatology practice, one maternal-fetal medicine practice and one pediatric cardiology practice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also believe that teleradiology will play a significant role in the practice of radiology in the future and that our teleradiology services business will be a valuable asset to us as we move down the path of building a broader radiology business through the acquisition of radiology physician group practices. We believe we bring a unique value proposition to radiology physician groups, in that we can provide not only practice support, but also teleradiology capabilities that can enhance their efficiency, provide subspecialty access and help them grow and remain competitive. 
 

 | Acquire complementary service businesses. In addition to growing our national physician practice network, we continue to expand the service offerings within our management services organization. During 2016, we acquired a national third-party receivables company that significantly expanded our capabilities through the delivery of solutions to hospitals and other medical facilities nationwide through patient-focused integrated service lines including eligibility, accounts receivable recovery and disability advocacy. We expect that the further development of our service offerings will function not only as support for our own physician practices but as a revenue generating outsourced service capability. We plan to pursue additional opportunities in order to expand our service offerings to address the evolving needs of our hospital partners and other customers while creating expanded opportunities for cross-selling our services in order to supplement our future growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strengthen and broaden relationships with our partners. By managing many of the operational challenges associated with physician practices, encouraging clinical research, education and quality initiatives, and promoting timely intervention by our physicians, we believe that our business model is focused on improving the quality of care delivered to patients, promoting the appropriate length of their hospital stays and optimizing efficient use of health system resources. We believe that referring and collaborating physicians, hospitals, third-party payors and patients all benefit to the extent that we are successful in implementing our business model. In addition, we will continue to concentrate efforts in becoming more responsive and proactive in broadening our existing hospital relationships to expand the scope of services that we provide across all specialties. We believe this will be critical as hospitals and health systems seek to expand their service offerings and as the broader healthcare market seeks new solutions to operate more efficiently.

CLINICAL RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND QUALITY 
 As part of our patient focus and ongoing commitment to improving patient care through evidenced-based medicine, we engage in clinical research, continuous quality improvement, safety and education initiatives. We discover, understand and teach healthcare practices that enhance the abilities of clinicians to deliver quality care, thereby contributing to better patient outcomes and reduced long-term health system costs. Our investment in these initiatives benefits our patients, clinicians, referring and collaborating physicians, hospital partners and third-party payors. We believe that these initiatives help us, among other things, to enhance the value of our services, attract new and retain existing clinicians, improve clinical operations and enhance practice communication. 

 | Clinical Research. We conduct clinical research to discover ways to improve clinical care for our patients. We share our discoveries throughout the medical community through submissions to peer-reviewed literature. Recent research activity includes:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In neonatal medicine, our paper Understanding outliers and defining value in neonatal healthcare (The Journal of Pediatrics), discussed the complexity of defining value in critically ill neonates. Truly understanding the outcome and the cost of achieving that outcome in a neonate requires years of follow up, but defining and measuring value is of great importance as it focuses efforts on improving healthcare. Our most important observations were published in the results from our study A Multifaceted Approach to Improving Outcomes in the NICU: The 100,000 Babies Campaign (Pediatrics). From 2007 to 2013, data on more than 400,000 babies at 330 NICUs was

gathered and analyzed. The campaign focused on five critical clinical practices and procedures used in neonatal care: enhancing nutrition, improving medication use, reducing central line infections, minimizing mechanical ventilation and reducing suboptimal admission temperatures. The campaign resulted in the increased use of human breast milk and the decreased use of commonly overused medications. In very low birth weight infants, mortality decreased by 22%, necrotizing enterocolitis decreased by 41%, severe retinopathy of prematurity decreased by 31%, late onset infections decreased by 54% and central line infections decreased by 56%. Implementation of a multifaceted quality improvement program that incorporated organizational change theory and automated electronic health record-based data collection and reporting resulted in major simultaneous improvements in key neonatal processes and outcomes. We have continued our collaboration with neonatal health care providers who want to solve important clinical questions using our clinical data warehouse and this has resulted in an additional 17 papers published in peer reviewed journals during 2016.

 | In maternal-fetal medicine, our affiliated physicians completed two multicenter studies during 2016, the results of which are expected to be published in the first half of 2017. The first study, A multicenter prospective study of neonatal outcomes at less than 32 weeks associated with reasons for maternal admission and delivery, includes over 1,000 mother baby pairs and is intended to determine if the reason for admission and delivery has an association with neonatal mortality and complication of prematurity. The second study, The Impact of cfDNA (NIPT) testing on the frequency of invasive procedures in a geographically diverse private network, evaluated more than 3,000 mothers. Data included all singleton gestations undergoing specific diagnostic tests during a certain period and comparing them to a study group derived from seven maternal-fetal practices in 16 clinics. Results from this geographically diverse population demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the number of invasive procedures accompanied by a marked increase in the number of positive results per procedure which should translate into a substantial decrease in losses and complications across a large population. Additional maternal-fetal medicine trials are currently underway.

 | Our pediatric cardiology research continues to rapidly develop. Our groups are currently evaluating the role of newborn screening for congenital cardiac disease in collaboration with many of our neonatology practices. This study completed enrollment of more than 6,000 infants and analysis of the results is underway with the expectation of being completed during 2017. We have already recognized that screening at very high altitudes can be problematic, and we expect several other pivotal observations to come out of this important work. In addition, a study that examines the relationship between long QTc Syndrome and both unilateral and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is underway. Many of our pediatric cardiology practices are involved in a variety of important collaborative research studies as part of both regional and national projects. Among these projects is our involvement in a decade long multicenter partnership with other childrens hospitals, funded by the American Heart Association, assessing health related quality of life outcomes in children with congenital and acquired heart disease. Our cardiology team is a member of the prestigious Pediatric Heart Network, a subsidiary of the National Heart Lung Blood Institute, an organization that evaluates the use of certain drugs following surgical procedures for children with complex congenital heart defects in order to improve exercise performance.

 | In anesthesiology, we both conduct and support clinical research across a spectrum of clinical efficacy, quality, therapeutic and device investigations, all with the goal of bringing better care to our patients. Our findings are shared throughout the medical community through peer-reviewed literature, presentation at national medical meetings and through educational venues. Our anesthesiology practices are currently engaged in more than 50 clinical trials in a variety of specialty areas across eight states. These range from anesthesia investigator initiated to quality/hospital database inquiry to industry-sponsored trials. We use our quality initiative tool, Quantum, to assess quality metrics and provide feedback to our clinicians. This database currently has over 1,000,000 audited patient encounters that enable us to illustrate and investigate best practices in

anesthesia care in community based healthcare systems. Papers utilizing data from Quantum have been published while others are in submission, and clinical trial results are now being accepted for publication. In addition, multiple presentations, some using abstracts from published papers, were given at national, regional and local meetings. We are well positioned to attract clinical trial sponsors, given our rich patient base and our pool of physician investigators.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In radiology, we have developed data analytic capabilities utilizing the radiology studies within our extensive database to evaluate information and provide evidence-based insights to key decision makers at healthcare systems regarding imaging utilization and clinical outcomes. Our radiology data provides us the ability to analyze disparate data and synthesize this into actionable findings. Through the use of this data, we have the insight to measure and demonstrate clinical quality, value and performance to our customers and third-party payors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We also continue to publish research based on data from our clinical information systems, our clinical trials, and from our individual practice efforts. In 2016, more than 60 papers were published as a result of this research addressing many different areas of neonatal, anesthesiology, maternal-fetal, and pediatric cardiology care with more data under review for publication. Our neonatal clinical data warehouse has also remained a major reference source at a national level, and continued to be highlighted and cited in several publications, as well as in numerous national forums and presentations during 2016. Our neonatal clinical data warehouse now has accumulated clinical information from more than 1.2 million infants and more than 22 million patient days and is frequently used in collaboration with universities and government agencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continuous Quality Improvement. Continuous quality improvement initiatives are important for all of our physician specialties. As part of our dedication to improving quality across our affiliated practices, we provide our clinicians with powerful information resources. Our physicians have access to accumulated data and robust software tools that enable them to compare their practices to our national practice network across a variety of activity and outcome metrics. From these comparisons, our physicians can identify areas for improvement, and then systematically monitor, study, learn and implement change. We believe that our initiatives in continuous quality improvement have contributed to better patient care. For example, we have an Outliers program in place to identify our performance against quality metrics that allows us to pair higher and lower performers who partner to find solutions to eliminate actual or perceived gaps in quality of care. This often involves partnership with our healthcare system and hospital partners to address problems that require collaborative solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For anesthesia care, through our quality initiative tool, we measure and assess certain performance, quality, outcome, and patient satisfaction metrics. Our performance metrics, including efficiency and timeliness are crucial in improving the patient experience of care, optimizing the use of healthcare resources and controlling healthcare costs. An example is the decrease in post-anesthesia care unit length of stay due to the use of a protocol designed to significantly decrease nausea and vomiting after anesthesia. Our quality metrics are analyzed to include standard clinical outcome reporting, trend analysis and threshold performance, all of which are provided to our individual physicians. The quality committees and medical directors of the practices manage quality improvement programs and drive best practices that are adapted to the needs of the local care setting. Patient satisfaction is measured in the postoperative period to assess overall satisfaction, specific outcomes of anesthetic procedures and to understand the patient perception of quality of care. The Quantum Quality Tool was acknowledged for its excellence by CMS as it was certified as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) that will now be used to report quality metrics for over 2,500 clinicians to our government. There are only five QCDRs in the country certified by CMS for anesthesiology. 
 Patient Safety Organization. We have established a federally listed Patient Safety Organization (PSO), the mission of which is to improve the quality and safety of care rendered by our clinical providers through the collection and analysis of quality data. As a federally listed PSO, our mission to improve the safety of care rendered is supported by the dissemination of best practices information and implementation of patient safety programs. 
 
13 
 
Our primary quality improvement program within our anesthesiology practices is our unique, multidisciplinary high reliability organization training (HRO) program, with the overarching goal of creating a culture of safety and establishing an expectation of accountability. Our HRO program trains clinicians through onsite assessment and coaching, teamwork, leadership training and safety tool development. Our clinicians also use the patient safety culture assessment tools sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Further, our surgical and nursing colleagues participate in our HRO program, both as team members and to provide feedback on our performance. To date, we have made quantifiable safety improvements in teamwork, communication and the use of safety tools such as checklists and protocols. Further, we have developed a real time near miss reporting phone application that has facilitated systemic improvements in our hospital and ambulatory care settings with our partners. 
 In addition, we have created a NICU patient safety program based on the concepts of HRO that began a wide scale train the trainer program in 2016 in order to more efficiently and effectively spread and implement the principles of patient safety, teamwork and communication to foster our safety culture. 
 

 | Continuing Medical Education. We also make extensive physician continuing medical education and continuing nursing education resources available to our affiliated clinicians in an effort to ensure that they have access to current treatment methodologies. As an accredited provider for clinicians, we offer live continuing medical education through what we believe is one of the premier conferences in neonatal medicineNEO: The Conference for Neonatology. In 2016, we also held our Specialty Review in Neonatology course, which provides a broad review of the entire subspecialty of neonatal medicine. These two meetings, each held annually, had more than 1,000 attendees in 2016. In addition to live educational opportunities, we also offer online education through Pediatrix UniversityA University Without Walls®, an interactive educational website, which we continue to enhance with live presentations that are recorded at our various in person conferences. In anesthesiology, ongoing medical education is crucial to our clinicians in order for them to stay abreast of the latest techniques, procedures, therapies and devices used in the perioperative period and to drive evidence-based best practices, guidelines, checklists and protocols. We accomplish this through a variety of formats including web-based and traditional meeting-based medical education. Our meeting-based medical education focuses on medical knowledge but also provides an opportunity for clinical skills workshops. Simulation has become increasingly important to support a variety of efforts including critical event scenarios, teamwork practice and maintenance of certification in anesthesia.

 We believe that these initiatives have been enhanced by our integrated national presence together with our clinical and management information systems, which are an integral component of our clinical research and education activities. See Our Information Systems. 
 PHYSICIAN PRACTICE GROUP ADMINISTRATION 
 We provide multiple administrative services to support the practice of medicine by our affiliated physicians and improve operating efficiencies of our affiliated practice groups. 
 

 | Unit Management. A senior physician practicing medicine in each neonatal, anesthesia, pediatric intensivist, maternal-fetal, pediatric cardiology and other subspecialty practice that we manage acts as the medical director for that practice. Each medical director is responsible for the overall management of his or her practice, including staffing and scheduling, quality of care, professional discipline, utilization review, coordinating physician recruitment and monitoring of the financial success within the practice. Medical directors also serve as a liaison with hospital administration, other physicians and the community.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Staffing and Scheduling. We assist with staffing and scheduling physicians and advanced practice nurses within the units and practices that we manage. For example, each NICU is staffed by at least one specialist on site or available on call. For our affiliated anesthesia physicians, CRNAs and AAs, we
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14 
 

employ an operational system that assists with their staffing and scheduling. We are responsible for managing and coordinating the process for the salaries and benefits paid and provided to our affiliated physicians and practitioners. In addition, we employ, compensate and manage all non-medical personnel for our affiliated physician groups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Recruiting and Credentialing. We have significant experience in locating, qualifying, recruiting and retaining experienced physicians. We maintain an extensive nationwide database of neonatologists, maternal-fetal medicine physicians, anesthesiologists and other pediatric subspecialty physicians and are working to develop such a database for radiologists. Our medical directors and physician leaders play a central role in the recruiting and interviewing process before candidates are introduced to other practice group physicians and hospital administrators. We verify the credentials, licenses and references of all prospective affiliated physician candidates. In addition to our database of physicians, we recruit nationally through trade advertising, referrals from our affiliated physicians and attendance at conferences.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Billing, Collection and Reimbursement. We assume responsibility for assisting our affiliated physicians with contracting with third-party payors. We are responsible for billing, collection and reimbursement for services rendered by our affiliated physicians. In all instances, however, we do not assume responsibility for charges relating to services provided by hospitals or other physicians with whom we collaborate. Such charges are separately billed and collected by the hospitals or other physicians. We provide our affiliated physicians with a training curriculum that emphasizes detailed documentation of and compliant coding protocols for all procedures performed and services provided, and we provide comprehensive internal auditing processes, all of which are designed to achieve compliant coding, billing and collection of revenue for physician services. Generally, our billing and collection operations are conducted from our business offices located across the United States and in Puerto Rico, as well as our corporate offices.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Risk Management. We maintain a risk management program focused on reducing risk, including the identification and communication of potential risk areas to our medical affairs staff. We maintain professional liability coverage for our national group of affiliated healthcare professionals. Through our risk management and medical affairs staff, we conduct risk management programs for loss prevention and early intervention in order to prevent or minimize professional liability claims.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Compliance. We provide a multi-faceted compliance program that is designed to assist our affiliated practice groups in understanding and complying with the increasingly complex laws, rules and regulations that govern the provision of healthcare services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other Services. We also provide management information systems, facilities management, legal support, marketing support and other services to our affiliated physicians and affiliated practice groups.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 We maintain several information systems that support our day-to-day operations, ongoing clinical research and business analysis. 
 

 | BabySteps®. BabySteps is an electronic health record system used by our affiliated neonatal physicians to record clinical progress notes and certain laboratory and radiology reports electronically and provides a decision tree to assist them in certain situations with the selection of appropriate billing codes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Clinical Data Warehouse. BabySteps enables our affiliated practices to capture a consistent set of clinical information about the patients who we treat. We de-identify and transfer information from our electronic health records that reside in BabySteps to our clinical data warehouse that since inception has accumulated clinical information from more than 22 million daily progress records relating to over 1.2 million neonatal health records. With comprehensive reporting tools, our physicians are able to use
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15 
 

this information to benchmark outcomes, enhance clinical decision-making and advance best practices at the bedside. Using a variety of clinical performance markers, our de-identified data warehouse also helps us track medication and procedure interactions, link treatments to outcomes and identify opportunities to enhance patient outcomes. Our clinical data warehouse also helps us to identify prospective clinical trials and continuous quality improvement initiatives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Quantum®. Quantum Clinical Navigation Systems (Quantum) is the quality metric acquisition and database tool that is being implemented throughout our anesthesiology physician practices. Quantum collects patient level data in real time through the continuum of care and includes over 1 million audited patient encounters. Over 80 quantifiable metrics assess patient satisfaction, efficiency, physician performance and quality indicators. The data is then stored, analyzed and reported to physicians and hospitals. Our clinicians use the data, along with evidence-based medicine, to develop and implement best practices and standard operating procedures, for educational programs and for providing quality metrics to our hospital partners, all with the goal of improving outcomes and efficiency and ensuring patient satisfaction. In 2015, Quantum was certified by CMS as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR), a reporting mechanism available for the Physician Quality Reporting System, the former CMS program initiated to promote reporting of quality measures. In 2016, we significantly increased the acquisition, data-basing and use of quality data as all of our anesthesiology clinicians are currently reporting quality metrics for almost 2 million patient encounters that are managed within the Quantum QCDR. As part of the annual CMS QCDR self-nomination process, MEDNAX expanded its QCDR inventory for 2017 to also include measures relevant to radiology and interventional pain management in addressing the CMS requirements for the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System.

 | Nextgen®. We have licensed the Nextgen Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Electronic Patient Management (EPM) system for our office-based physicians to record clinical documentation related to their patients and manage the revenue cycle for our office-based practices. This system has the ability to provide benefits to our office-based practices that are similar to what BabySteps provides to our neonatology practices, including decision trees to assist physicians with the selection of compliant billing codes, promotion of consistent documentation, and data for research and education. We are continuing the process of implementing EMR and EPM in all of our office-based maternal-fetal and pediatric cardiology practices. The version of our Nextgen system currently being used has been certified as a Complete Electronic Health Record system by the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology, in accordance with the applicable certification criteria adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that support the Stage 1 meaningful use measures required to qualify eligible providers and hospitals for funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | eCCAP. Our electronic charge capture system is used to appropriately record and bill for pediatric intensive care clinicians, hospitalist clinicians and other clinical care providers. We also use administrative data derived from this system to drive quality assurance and quality improvement programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Teleradiology Clinical Data Warehouse. Our extensive database of aggregated and normalized radiology studies powers our sophisticated analytic tool. Our analytic tool provides evidence-based insights to our own practice and to key decision makers at hospitals and healthcare systems, as well as to onsite radiology groups regarding optimal staffing, imaging utilization and clinical outcomes, all to help them more efficiently manage their radiology service lines and practices. Our analytic tool is relevant for both hospitals trying to better manage costs and improve operating efficiencies, as well as to radiology groups trying to demonstrate value in an increasingly challenging and evolving healthcare reimbursement environment. Our analytic tool provides us the opportunity to be considered as a strategic partner to both existing and new clients who rely on our insight to efficiently manage their radiology service lines and practices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
16 
 

 | Pediatrix University® and American Anesthesiology University. In addition to providing continuing education, our web-based education platforms also function as important educational adjuncts to our affiliated physician groups, providing a rich source of ongoing medical education for our physicians and enabling physicians to discuss cases with one another through various clinical resources.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our management information systems are also an integral element of the billing and reimbursement process. We maintain systems that provide for electronic data interchange with payors that accept electronic submissions, including electronic claims submission, insurance benefits verification and claims processing and remittance advice, which enable us to track numerous and diverse third-party payor relationships and payment methods. Our information systems provide scalability and flexibility as payor groups upgrade their payment and reimbursement systems. We continually seek improvements to our systems to expedite the overall process, streamline information gathering from our clinical systems and improve efficiencies in the reimbursement process. 
 We maintain additional information systems designed to improve operating efficiencies of our affiliated practice groups, reduce physicians paperwork requirements and facilitate interaction among our affiliated physicians and their colleagues regarding patient care issues. Following the acquisition of a physician practice group, we implement systematic procedures to improve the acquired groups operating and financial performance. One of our first steps is to convert a newly acquired group to our broad-based management information system. We also maintain a database management system to assist our business development and recruiting departments to identify potential practice group acquisitions and physician candidates. 
 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR PARTNERS 
 Our business model, which has been influenced by the direct contact and daily interaction that our affiliated physicians have with their patients, emphasizes a patient-focused clinical approach that addresses the needs of our various partners, including hospitals, third-party payors, referring and collaborating physicians, affiliated physicians and, most importantly, our patients. 
Hospitals and Other Customers 
 Our relationships with our hospital partners and other customers are critical to our operations. Hospitals control access to their units and operating rooms through the awarding of contracts and hospital privileges. We have been retained by approximately 520 hospitals to staff and manage clinical activities within specific hospital-based units and other departments. Our affiliated physicians are important components of obstetric, pediatric and surgical services provided at hospitals. Our hospital-based focus enhances our relationships with hospitals and creates opportunities for our affiliated physicians to provide patient care in other areas of the hospital. For example, our physicians may provide care in emergency rooms, nurseries, intensive care units and other departments where access to specialized obstetric, pediatric and anesthesia care may be critical. Our hospital partners benefit from our expertise in managing critical care units and other settings staffed with physician specialists, including managing variable admission rates, operating costs, complex reimbursement systems and other administrative burdens. We work with our hospital partners to enhance their reputation and market our services to referring physicians within the communities served by those hospitals. We also provide radiology physician services to hospitals and other physician groups. In addition, our affiliated physicians work with our hospital partners to develop integrated services programs for solutions within the services we provide. Integrated programs provide our hospital partners and us with incremental growth and result in a broader spectrum of care across our specialties and permit us to extend our patient service lines into our existing markets. Our relationships with our hospital partners are continually evolving with the goal of being viewed by them as a solutions provider across all of our specialties. 
 Under our contracts with hospitals, we have the responsibility to manage, in many cases exclusively, the provision of physician services for hospital-based units, such as NICUs, and other hospital settings. We typically are responsible for billing patients and third-party payors for services rendered by our affiliated physicians 
 
17 
 
 separately from other related charges billed by the hospital or other physicians to the same payors. Some of our hospital contracts require hospitals to pay us administrative fees. Some contracts provide for fees if the hospital does not generate sufficient patient volume in order to guarantee that we receive a specified minimum revenue level. We also receive fees from hospitals for administrative services performed by our affiliated physicians providing medical director services at the hospital. Administrative fees accounted for 8.5% of our net revenue during 2016. Some of our contracts with hospitals require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our affiliated physicians. Our hospital contracts typically have terms of one to three years which can be terminated without cause by either party upon prior written notice, and renew automatically for additional terms of one to three years unless terminated early by any party. While we have in most cases been able to renew these arrangements, hospitals may cancel or not renew our arrangements, or reduce or eliminate our administrative fees in the future. 
 Third-Party Payors 
 Our relationships with government-sponsored or funded healthcare programs (GHC Programs), including Medicare and Medicaid, and with managed care organizations and commercial health insurance payors are vital to our business. We seek to maintain professional working relationships with our third-party payors, streamline the administrative process of billing and collection, and assist our patients and their families in understanding their health insurance coverage and any balances due for co-payments, co-insurance, deductibles or benefit limitations. In addition, through our quality initiatives and continuing research and education efforts, we have sought to enhance clinical care provided to patients, which we believe benefits third-party payors by contributing to improved patient outcomes and reduced long-term health system costs. 
 We receive compensation for professional services provided by our affiliated physicians to patients based upon rates for specific services provided, principally from third-party payors. Our billed charges are substantially the same for all parties in a particular geographic area, regardless of the party responsible for paying the bill for our services, but the payments we receive vary among payors. A significant portion of our net revenue is received from GHC Programs, principally state Medicaid and federal Medicare programs. 
 Medicaid programs, which are jointly funded by the federal government and state governments, pay for medical and health-related services for certain categories of individuals and families generally who have low incomes or disabilities. Medicaid programs can be either standard fee-for-service payment programs or managed care programs in which states have contracted with health insurance companies to run local or state-wide health plans with features similar to health maintenance organizations. Our compensation rates under standard fee-for-service Medicaid programs are established by state governments and are not negotiated. Although Medicaid rates vary across the states, these rates are generally much lower in comparison to private-sector health plan rates. Rates under Medicaid managed care programs typically are negotiated, but are also much lower in comparison to private-sector health plan rates. 
 The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows states to expand their Medicaid programs to enroll more individuals through federal payments that fund most of the cost of increasing the Medicaid eligibility income limit from a states historical eligibility levels to 133% of the federal poverty level. To date, only 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility to cover this additional low income patient population. All of the states in which we operate, however, already cover children in the first year of life and pregnant women if their household income is at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. In light of changes to the ACA, some of these states may eliminate, reduce or otherwise modify expanded enrollment eligibility. See Item 1A. Risk Factors State budgetary constraints and the uncertainty over the future Medicaid expansion could have an adverse effect on our reimbursement from Medicaid programs and The ACA and potential changes to it may have a significant effect on our business. 
 Medicare is a health insurance program primarily for individuals 65 years of age and older, younger individuals with certain disabilities and individuals with end-stage renal disease. The program is available 
 
18 
 
 without regard to income or assets (with means-tested premiums for beneficiaries with relatively high incomes) and offers beneficiaries different ways to obtain their medical benefits. The most common option selected today by Medicare beneficiaries is the traditional fee-for-service payment system. The other options include managed care, preferred provider organizations, private fee-for-service and specialty plans. Medicare compensation rates are generally much lower in comparison to private-sector health plans. Because we provide anesthesia services to a wide array of patients, including Medicare beneficiaries, a portion of our patients services are reimbursed by Medicare. 
 In order to participate in government programs, we and our affiliated practices must comply with stringent and often complex standards, including enrollment and reimbursement requirements. Different states also impose varying standards for their Medicaid programs. See Government RegulationGovernment Reimbursement Requirements. 
 We also receive compensation pursuant to contracts with commercial payors that offer a wide variety of health insurance products, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and exclusive provider organizations that are subject to various state laws and regulations, as well as employer-sponsored coverage subject to federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requirements. We seek to secure mutually agreeable contracts with payors that enable our affiliated physicians to be listed as in-network participants within the payors provider networks. We generally contract with commercial payors through our affiliated professional contractors. Subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations, the terms, conditions and compensation rates of our contracts with commercial third-party payors are negotiated and often vary across markets and among payors. In some cases, we contract with organizations that establish and maintain provider networks and then rent or lease such networks to the actual payor. Our contracts with commercial payors typically provide for discounted fee-for-service arrangements and grant each party the right to terminate the contracts without cause upon prior written notice. In addition, these contracts generally give commercial payors the right to audit our billings and related reimbursements for professional and other services provided by or through our affiliated physicians. 
 If we do not have a contractual relationship with a health insurance payor, we generally bill the payor our full billed charges. If payment is less than billed charges, we bill the balance to the patient, subject to federal and state laws regulating such billing. Although we maintain standard billing and collections procedures with appropriate discounts for prompt payment, we also provide discounts in certain hardship situations where patients and their families do not have financial resources necessary to pay the amount due for services rendered. Any amounts written-off are based on the specific facts and circumstances related to each individual patient account. 
 Referring and Collaborating Physicians 
 Our relationships with our referring and collaborating physicians are critical to our success. Our affiliated physicians seek to establish and maintain professional relationships with referring physicians in the communities where they practice. Because patient volumes in our NICUs are based in part on referrals from other physicians, particularly obstetricians, it is important that we are responsive to the needs of referring physicians in the communities in which we operate. We believe that our community presence, through our hospital coverage and outpatient clinics, assists referring obstetricians, office-based pediatricians and family physicians with their practices. Our affiliated physicians are able to provide comprehensive maternal-fetal, newborn and pediatric subspecialty care to patients using the latest advances in methodologies, supporting the local referring physician community with 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week on-site or on-call coverage. 
 Our affiliated anesthesiologists seek to establish and maintain professional relationships with collaborating physicians, such as surgeons, and other healthcare providers. Our affiliated anesthesiologists play an important role for surgeons because they provide medical care to the patient throughout the surgical experience. This care includes evaluation of the patient prior to surgery, consultations with the surgical team, providing pain control 
 
19 
 
 and support of life functions during surgery and supervising care following surgery through the discharge of the patient from the recovery unit. Accordingly, our affiliated anesthesiologists are focused on delivering quality services to enhance the reputation and satisfaction of collaborating surgeons. 
 Affiliated Physicians and Practice Groups 
 Our relationships with our affiliated physicians are important. Our affiliated physicians are organized in traditional practice group structures. In accordance with applicable state laws, our affiliated practice groups are responsible for the provision of medical care to patients. Our affiliated practice groups are separate legal entities organized under state law as business corporations or professional associations, professional corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships, which we sometimes refer to as our affiliated professional contractors. Each of our affiliated professional contractors is owned by a licensed physician affiliated with the Company through employment or another contractual relationship. Our national infrastructure enables more effective and efficient sharing of new discoveries and clinical outcomes data, including best demonstrated processes, access to our sophisticated information systems, clinical research and education. 
 Our business corporations and affiliated professional contractors employ or contract with physicians to provide clinical services in certain states and Puerto Rico. In most of our affiliated practice groups, each physician has entered into an employment agreement with us or one of our affiliated professional contractors providing for a base salary and incentive bonus eligibility and typically having a term of three to seven years. We are typically responsible for billing patients and third-party payors for services rendered by our affiliated physicians and, with respect to services provided in a hospital, separately from other charges billed by hospitals to the same payors. Each physician must hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which he or she provides patient care and must become a member of the medical staff, with appropriate clinical privileges, at each hospital at which he or she practices. Substantially all the physicians employed by us or our affiliated professional contractors have agreed not to compete within a specified geographic area during employment and for a certain period after termination of employment. Although we believe that the non-competition covenants of our affiliated physicians are reasonable in scope and duration and therefore enforceable under applicable state laws, we cannot predict whether a court or arbitration panel would enforce these covenants in any particular case. Our hospital contracts also typically require that we and the physicians performing services maintain minimum levels of professional and general liability insurance. We negotiate those policies and contract and pay the premiums for such insurance on behalf of the physicians. 
 Each of our affiliated professional contractors has entered into a comprehensive management agreement with a subsidiary of MEDNAX as the manager. These agreements are long-term in nature, and in most cases permanent, subject only to a right of termination by the manager (except in the case of gross negligence, fraud or illegal acts of the manager). Under the terms of these management agreements, and subject to state laws and other regulations, the manager is typically paid for its services based on the performance of the applicable practice group. See Government RegulationFee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine. 
 COMPETITION 
 Competition in our business is generally based upon a number of factors, including reputation, experience and level of care and our affiliated physicians ability to provide cost-effective, quality clinical care. The nature of competition for our hospital-based practices, such as neonatology and anesthesia care, differs significantly from competition for our office-based practices. Our hospital-based practices compete nationally with other health services companies and physician groups for hospital contracts and qualified physicians. In some instances, our hospital-based physicians also compete on a regional or local basis. For example, our neonatologists compete for referrals from local physicians and transports from surrounding hospitals. Our office-based practices, such as maternal-fetal medicine and pediatric cardiology, compete for patients with office-based practices in those subspecialties. 
 
20 
 
Hospitals control access to their NICUs and operating rooms by awarding contracts and hospital clinical privileges, and our relationships with our hospital partners are critical to our operations. Because our operations consist primarily of physician services provided within hospital-based units, we compete with others for contracts with hospitals to provide services. We also compete with hospitals themselves to provide such services. Hospitals may employ neonatologists or anesthesiologists directly or contract with other physician groups to provide services either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. A hospital not otherwise competing with us may begin to do so by opening a new NICU or operating facility, expanding the capacity of an existing NICU, adding operating room suites or, in the case of neonatal services, upgrading the level of its existing NICU. If the hospital chooses to do so, it may award the contract to operate the relevant facility to a competing group or company from within or outside the surrounding community. Our contracts with hospitals generally provide that they may be terminated without cause upon prior written notice. 
 In addition, we compete in our other service lines such as teleradiology with other teleradiology service providers where costs to provide services may be lower and turnaround times may be faster. We also compete directly with hospitals themselves as they may consider reading images with their own employed radiologists rather than outsource those reads to our affiliated radiologists. 
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Companies in other segments of the industry as well as healthcare-focused and other private equity firms, some of which have financial and other resources greater than ours, may become competitors in providing neonatal, anesthesia, maternal-fetal and other pediatric subspecialty care. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 The healthcare industry is governed by a framework of federal and state laws, rules and regulations that are extensive and complex and for which, in many cases, the industry has the benefit of only limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. The resources and costs required to comply with these laws, rules and regulations are high. If we or one of our affiliated practice groups or service businesses is found to have violated these laws, rules or regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected. The ACA made numerous changes that are having the effect of reshaping the United States healthcare delivery system. Further healthcare reform, including potential repeal of or changes to the ACA, continues to attract significant legislative interest, legal challenges, regulatory and compliance requirements, new approaches and public attention that create uncertainty and the potential for additional changes. Healthcare reform implementation, additional legislation or regulations, and other changes in government policy or regulation may affect our reimbursement, restrict our existing operations, limit the expansion of our business or impose additional compliance requirements and costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The ACA and potential changes to it may have a significant effect on our business. 
Licensing and Certification 
 Each state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and clinical professionals, and on facilities operated or utilized by healthcare companies like us. Many states require regulatory approval, including certificates of need, before establishing certain types of healthcare facilities, offering certain services or expending amounts in excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. We and our affiliated physicians are also required to meet applicable Medicare provider requirements under federal laws, rules and regulations and Medicaid provider requirements under federal and state laws, rules and regulations. 
Fee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine 
 Many states have laws that prohibit business corporations, such as MEDNAX, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians, or engaging 
 
21 
 
 in certain arrangements, such as fee splitting, with physicians. In light of these restrictions, we operate by maintaining long-term management contracts through our subsidiaries with affiliated professional contractors, which employ or contract with physicians to provide physician professional services. Under these arrangements, our manager subsidiaries perform only non-medical administrative services, do not represent that they offer medical services and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians employed by the affiliated professional contractors. In states where fee splitting with a business corporation or manager is prohibited, the fees that are received from the affiliated professional contractors have been established on a basis that we believe complies with applicable laws. Although the relevant laws in these states have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation, we believe that we are in compliance with applicable state laws in relation to the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting. However, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our affiliated physicians, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we or our manager subsidiaries are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with the affiliated professional contractors constitute unlawful fee splitting, in which case we could be subject to administrative, civil or criminal remedies or penalties, the contracts could be found to be legally invalid and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements with our affiliated professional contractors. 
 Fraud and Abuse Provisions 
 Existing federal laws, as well as similar state laws, governing Medicare, Medicaid and other GHC Programs, impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare companies like us. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and various state agencies. In addition, in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress established a Medicaid Integrity Program to enhance federal and state efforts to detect Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse and to provide financial incentives for states to enact their own false claims legislation as an additional enforcement tool against Medicaid fraud and abuse. Since then, a growing number of states have enacted or expanded their healthcare fraud and abuse laws. 
 The fraud and abuse provisions include extensive federal and state laws, rules and regulations applicable to our financial relationships with hospitals, referring physicians and other healthcare entities. In particular, the federal anti-kickback statute has criminal provisions relating to the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration in return for either referring Medicare, Medicaid or other GHC Program business, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any service or item for which payment may be made by GHC Programs. In addition, the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, applies to physician ordering of certain designated health services reimbursable by Medicare from an entity with which the physician has a prohibited financial relationship. These laws are broadly worded and have been broadly interpreted by federal courts and agencies, and potentially subject many healthcare business arrangements to government investigation, enforcement and prosecution, which can be costly and time consuming. 
 Violations of these laws are punishable by substantial penalties and other remedies, including monetary fines, civil penalties, administrative remedies, criminal sanctions (in the case of the anti-kickback statute), exclusion from participation in GHC Programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws. Many of the states in which we operate also have similar anti-kickback and self-referral laws which are applicable to our government and non-government business and which also authorize substantial penalties for violations. 
 There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws authorizing the imposition of criminal, civil and administrative penalties for submitting false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to government healthcare programs. These laws include the civil False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits the submission of, or causing to be submitted, false claims to GHC Programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE (the program for military dependents and retirees), the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and insurance plans purchased through the ACA insurance exchanges. Substantial civil 
 
22 
 
 fines and multiple damages, along with other remedies, including exclusion from GHC Programs, can be imposed for violating the FCA. Furthermore, proving a violation of the FCA requires only that the government show that the individual or company that submitted or caused to be submitted an allegedly false claim acted in reckless disregard or in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the claim or with willful disregard, notwithstanding that there may have been no specific intent to defraud the government program and no actual knowledge that the claim was false (which typically are required to be shown to sustain a criminal conviction). The FCA also applies to the improper retention of identified overpayments and includes whistleblower provisions that permit private citizens to sue a claimant on behalf of the government and thereby share in the amounts recovered under the law and to receive additional remedies. In recent years, many cases have been brought against healthcare companies by such whistleblowers, which have resulted in judgments or, more often, settlements involving substantial payments to the government by the companies involved. It is anticipated that the number of such actions against healthcare companies will continue to increase with the enactment or enhancement of a growing number of state false claims acts, certain amendments to the FCA and enhanced government enforcement. 
 In addition, federal and state agencies that administer healthcare programs have at their disposal statutes, commonly known as civil money penalty laws, that authorize substantial administrative fines, along with legal and regulatory provisions that can lead to exclusion from participation in government programs, in cases where an individual or company filed a false claim, caused a false claim to be filed, or knew or should have known that the claim was false or fraudulent. As under the FCA, it often is not necessary for the agency to show that the claimant had actual knowledge that the claim was false or fraudulent in order to impose these penalties and remedies. 
 The civil and administrative false claims statutes are being applied in a broad range of circumstances. For example, government authorities have asserted that claiming reimbursement for services that fail to meet applicable quality standards may, under certain circumstances, violate these statutes. Government authorities also often take the position, now with support in the FCA, that claims for services that were induced by kickbacks, Stark Law violations or other illicit marketing schemes are fraudulent and, therefore, violate the false claims statutes. Many of the laws and regulations referenced above can be used in conjunction with each other. 
 If we or our affiliated professional contractors were excluded from participation in any GHC Programs, not only would we be prohibited from submitting claims for reimbursement under such programs, but we also would be unable to contract with other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to provide services to them. It could also adversely affect our or our affiliated professional contractors ability to contract with, or obtain payment from, non-governmental payors. 
 Although we intend to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, many of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us, including those relating to billing and those relating to financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied by prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authorities in ways that we cannot predict. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. Moreover, the standards of business conduct expected of healthcare companies under these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years, even in instances where there has been no change in statutory or regulatory language. If there is a determination by government authorities that we have not complied with any of these laws, rules and regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected. See Government Investigations. 
 Government Reimbursement Requirements 
 In order to participate in the Medicare program and in the various state Medicaid programs, we and our affiliated physician practices must comply with stringent and often complex enrollment and reimbursement 
 
23 
 
 requirements. Moreover, different states impose varying standards for their Medicaid programs. While our compliance program requires that we and our affiliated physician practices adhere to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the government programs in which we participate, our failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Government RegulationFraud and Abuse Provisions, Government RegulationCompliance Program, Government Investigations and Other Legal Proceedings, and Item 1A. Risk FactorsGovernment-funded programs, private insurers or state laws and regulations may limit, reduce or make retroactive adjustments to reimbursement amounts or rates, We may become subject to billing investigations by federal and state government authorities and The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. 
 In addition, GHC Programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments, as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to providers. Moreover, because these programs generally provide for reimbursement on a fee-schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue through increases in the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, these increased costs. In attempts to limit federal and state spending, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of proposals to limit or reduce Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for various services. Our business may be significantly and adversely affected by any such changes in reimbursement policies and other legislative initiatives aimed at reducing healthcare costs associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. 
 Our business also could be adversely affected by reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under these government programs, reductions in funding of these programs or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under these programs. 
 Antitrust 
 The healthcare industry is subject to close antitrust scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and state Attorneys General all actively review and, in some cases, take enforcement action against business conduct and acquisitions in the healthcare industry. Private parties harmed by alleged anticompetitive conduct can also bring antitrust suits. Violations of antitrust laws may be punishable by substantial penalties, including significant monetary fines, civil penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees and injunctions prohibiting certain activities or requiring divestiture or discontinuance of business operations. Any of these penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 
 Numerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of personal information. For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), and its implementing regulations govern the use, disclosure and security of protected health information (PHI) and violations of HIPAA are punishable by monetary fines, civil penalties and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. As part of our business operations, including in connection with medical record keeping, third-party billing, research and other services, we and our affiliated physician practices collect and maintain PHI regarding patients, which subjects us to compliance with HIPAA requirements. 
 Pursuant to HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has adopted privacy regulations, known as the privacy rule, to govern the uses and disclosures of PHI (the Privacy Rule). The 
 
24 
 
 Privacy Rule applies to PHI in any form, whether electronic, paper or oral, that is created, received, maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, hospitals, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are known as Covered Entities. We have implemented privacy policies and procedures, including training programs, designed to comply with the requirements set forth in the Privacy Rule. 
 HHS has also adopted data security regulations (the Security Rules) that require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of individually identifiable health information that is electronically created, received, maintained or transmitted (including between us and our affiliated practices). We have implemented security policies, procedures and systems, including training programs, designed to comply with the requirements set forth in the Security Rules. 
 In addition, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as part of the ARRA. Among other changes to the laws governing PHI, HITECH strengthened and expanded HIPAA requirements, increased penalties for violations, gave patients new rights to restrict uses and disclosures of their health information and imposed a number of privacy and security requirements directly on our Business Associates, which are third-parties that perform functions or services for us or on our behalf that involve the use or disclosure of PHI. Under HITECH, Covered Entities are required to report any unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI that meets the definition of a breach to the affected individuals, HHS and, depending on the number of affected individuals, the media for the affected market. In addition, HITECH requires that Business Associates report breaches to their Covered Entity customers. HITECH also authorizes state Attorneys General to bring civil actions in response to violations of HIPAA that threaten the privacy of state residents. We have adopted privacy policies and procedures designed to comply with the applicable requirements set forth in HITECH. 
 In addition to the federal HIPAA and HITECH requirements, numerous state and certain other federal laws protect the confidentiality of patient information and other personal information, including state medical privacy laws, state social security number protection, state data breach notification laws, state genetic privacy laws, human subjects research laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. In some cases, state laws are more stringent than HIPAA and are not preempted by the federal requirements. 
 These requirements are also subject to change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs, and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations. For example, HITECH further restricted our ability to collect, disclose and use sensitive personal information and imposed additional compliance requirements on us. 
 HIPAA Transaction Requirements 
 In addition to privacy and data security regulations, HIPAA and its implementing regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use for electronic healthcare transactions. For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to third-party payors must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payor is a government or a private entity. Effective October 1, 2015, we began reporting, as required, medical diagnoses under new International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition, (ICD-10), which replaced the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, (ICD-9), medical coding diagnosis codes. ICD-10 codes are different from ICD-9 codes and require entities to code with much greater detail and specificity than ICD-9 codes. If claims are not reported properly under ICD-10 due to technical or coding errors or other implementation issues involving systems, including ours and those of our third-party payors, there can be a delay in the processing and payment of such claims, or a denial of such claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
25 
 
Environmental Regulations 
 Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our office-based operations are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Such compliance does not, and we anticipate that such compliance will not, materially affect our capital expenditures, financial position or results of operations. 
Compliance Program 
 We maintain a compliance program that includes the established elements of an effective program and reflects our commitment to complying with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business and that meets our ethical obligations in conducting our business (the Compliance Program). We believe our Compliance Program provides a solid framework to meet this commitment and our obligations as a provider of healthcare services, including: 

 | a Chief Compliance Officer who reports to the Board of Directors on a regular basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a Compliance Committee consisting of our senior executives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | a formal internal audit function, including a Senior Director of Internal Audit who reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our Code of Conduct, which is applicable to our employees, independent contractors, officers and directors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our Code of Professional ConductFinance, which is applicable to our finance personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a disclosure program that includes a mechanism to enable individuals to disclose on a confidential or anonymous basis to the Chief Compliance Officer or any person who is not in the disclosing individuals chain of command, issues or questions believed by the individual to be a potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws or of company policies or procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an organizational structure designed to integrate our compliance objectives into our corporate offices, divisions, regions and practices; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | education, monitoring and corrective action programs designed to establish methods to promote the understanding of our Compliance Program and adherence to its requirements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The foundation of our Compliance Program is our Code of Conduct, which is intended to be a comprehensive statement of the ethical and legal standards governing the daily activities of our employees, affiliated professionals, independent contractors, officers and directors. All our personnel are required to abide by, and are given thorough education regarding, our Code of Conduct. In addition, all employees and affiliated professionals are expected to report incidents that they believe in good faith may be in violation of our Code of Conduct. We maintain a toll-free helpline to permit individuals to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis and obtain answers to questions about our Code of Conduct. Our Compliance Program, including our Code of Conduct, is administered by our Chief Compliance Officer with oversight by our Chief Executive Officer, Compliance Committee and Board of Directors. Copies of our Code of Conduct and our Code of Professional ConductFinance are available on our website, www.mednax.com. Our Internet website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not incorporated into or deemed a part of this Form 10-K. Any amendments or waivers to our Code of Professional ConductFinance will be promptly disclosed on our website following the date of any such amendment or waiver. 
 GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS 
 We expect that audits, inquiries and investigations from government authorities, agencies, contractors and payors will occur in the ordinary course of business. Such audits, inquiries and investigations and their ultimate resolutions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 
26 
 
OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, most of which involve claims of medical malpractice related to medical services provided by our affiliated physicians. Our contracts with hospitals generally require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our affiliated physicians and other clinicians. We may also become subject to other lawsuits that could involve large claims and significant defense costs. We believe, based upon a review of pending actions and proceedings, that the outcome of such legal actions and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. The outcome of such actions and proceedings, however, cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. 
 Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot ensure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. With respect to professional liability risk, we self-insure a significant portion of this risk through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See Professional and General Liability Coverage. 
 PROFESSIONAL AND GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE 
 We maintain professional and general liability insurance policies with third-party insurers generally on a claims-made basis, subject to deductibles, self-insured retention limits, policy aggregates, exclusions, and other restrictions, in accordance with standard industry practice. We believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate based upon our claims experience and the nature and risks of our business. However, we cannot predict whether any pending or future claim would be successful or, if successful, would not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage. 
 Our business entails an inherent risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians, clinicians and us. We contract and pay premiums for professional liability insurance that indemnifies us and our affiliated healthcare professionals generally on a claims-made basis for losses incurred related to medical malpractice litigation. Professional liability coverage is required in order for our affiliated physicians to maintain hospital privileges. Our self-insured retention under our professional liability insurance program is maintained primarily through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. We record estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements for our liabilities for self-insured retention amounts and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial valuation using historical loss information, claim emergence patterns and various actuarial assumptions. Liabilities for claims incurred but not reported are not discounted. Because many factors can affect historical and future loss patterns, the determination of an appropriate reserve involves complex, subjective judgment, and actual results may vary significantly from estimates. If the self-insured retention amounts and other amounts that we are actually required to pay materially exceed the estimates that have been reserved, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially, adversely affected. 
 EMPLOYEES AND PROFESSIONALS UNDER CONTRACT 
 In addition to the over 3,600 practicing physicians affiliated with us as of December 31, 2016, we employed or contracted with approximately 3,615 other clinical professionals and approximately 7,400 other full-time and part-time employees. 
GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE 
 We provide physician services across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In addition, through our complementary service businesses, we provide full service revenue cycle management and 
 
27 
 
 consulting services to healthcare facilities and physicians nationwide. During 2016, approximately 51% of our net revenue was generated by operations in our five largest states. Our operations in Texas accounted for approximately 19% of our net revenue for the same period. Although we continue to seek to diversify the geographic scope of our operations, primarily through acquisitions of physician group practices, we may not be able to implement successfully or realize the expected benefits of any of these initiatives. Adverse changes or conditions affecting states in which our operations are concentrated, such as healthcare reforms, changes in laws, rules and regulations, reduced Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements, an increase in the income level required to qualify for government healthcare programs or government investigations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
