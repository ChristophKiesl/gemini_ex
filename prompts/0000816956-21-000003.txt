General

CONMED Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1970 and became a Delaware corporation in May 2020.  CONMED is a medical technology company that provides surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures.  The Company’s products are used by surgeons and other healthcare professionals in a variety of specialties including orthopedics, general surgery, gynecology, thoracic surgery and gastroenterology.   The Company’s 3,400 employees distribute its products worldwide from three primary manufacturing locations.  In January 2021, we changed the designation of our headquarters from Utica, New York to Largo, Florida.
We have historically used strategic business acquisitions, internal product development and distribution relationships to diversify our product offerings, increase our market share in certain product lines, realize economies of scale and take advantage of growth opportunities in the healthcare field. 

We are committed to offering products with the highest standards of quality, technological excellence and customer service.  Substantially all of our facilities have attained certification under the ISO international quality standards and other domestic and international quality accreditations.

Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website (http://www.conmed.com) as soon as practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http:/www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file with the SEC.

COVID-19
Our business has been significantly impacted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Company experiencing lower sales in 2020 compared to 2019, first in the Asia/Pacific Rim and later in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as temporary closures occurred and hospitals and surgery centers postponed many non-urgent surgical procedures to minimize the risk of infection. In compliance with various governmental orders, beginning in March 2020 we restricted access to our main facilities to only essential personnel required to be on-site while maintaining production and distribution as medical device manufacturing was deemed essential. See additional discussion under Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Business Strategy

CONMED's vision is to empower healthcare providers worldwide to deliver exceptional outcomes for patients through the following initiatives: 
•Introduction of New Products and Product Enhancements.  We pursue organic growth through developing new products and enhancing existing products.  We seek to develop new technologies which improve the durability, performance and usability of existing products.  In addition to our internal research and development efforts, we receive new ideas for products and technologies, particularly in procedure-specific areas, from surgeons, inventors and other healthcare professionals.
•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions.  We pursue strategic acquisitions, distribution and similar arrangements in existing and new growth markets to achieve increased operating efficiencies, geographic diversification and market penetration.  Targeted companies have historically included those with proven technologies and established brand names which provide potential sales, marketing and manufacturing synergies. This includes the February 11, 2019 acquisition of Buffalo Filter.
•Realize Manufacturing and Operating Efficiencies.  We continually review our production systems for opportunities to reduce operating costs, consolidate product lines or process flows, reduce inventory and optimize existing processes.  
•Geographic Diversification.  We believe that significant growth opportunities exist for our surgical products outside the United States.  Principal international markets for our products include Europe, Latin America, Canada and the Asia/Pacific Rim.  
•Active Participation in the Medical Community.  We believe that excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry enable us to gain an understanding of trends and emerging opportunities.  Active participation allows us to quickly respond to the changing needs of physicians and patients. In addition, we are an active sponsor of medical education both in the United States and internationally, offering training on new and innovative surgical techniques as well as other medical education programs on the use of our products.

Orthopedic Surgery
Our orthopedic surgery product offering includes procedure specific, sports medicine implants and single-use products, powered surgical instruments, and sports biologics and tissue. These products are marketed under a number of brands, including Hall®, CONMED Linvatec®, Concept® and Shutt®. In 2020, approximately 74% of orthopedic surgery revenue came from single-use products that are expected to be recurring.
We offer a comprehensive range of products to repair injuries in the articulating joint areas of the body.  Many of these injuries are the result of sports-related events or similar traumas.  Our sports medicine products include powered resection instruments, arthroscopes, reconstructive systems, tissue repair sets, metal and bioabsorbable implants as well as related disposable products and fluid management systems.  It is our standard practice to place some of these products, such as shaver consoles and fluid pumps, with certain customers at no charge in exchange for commitments to purchase disposable products over certain time periods.  We loan this capital equipment, and it is subject to return if the customer does not meet certain minimum single-use purchases. Single-use products include products such as shaver blades, burs and pump tubing.  In sports medicine, we compete with Smith & Nephew, plc; Arthrex, Inc.; Stryker Corporation; Johnson & Johnson: DePuy Mitek, Inc. and Zimmer Biomet, Inc.

General Surgery
Our general surgery product line offers a large range of products in the areas of advanced surgical, endoscopic technologies and critical care. In 2020, approximately 88% of general surgery revenue came from single-use products that are expected to be recurring.
Our advanced surgical product offering includes the leading clinical insufflation system (AirSeal®). AirSeal® includes the proprietary valveless access ports that deliver significant benefits to traditional minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgical procedures. The Buffalo Filter acquisition complemented the CONMED portfolio of smoke removal devices, which provides the Company with the broadest portfolio of disposable and capital smoke evacuation products available in the medical device market today. In addition to AirSeal® and the Buffalo Filter® products, the Company manufactures and sells an extensive energy line and a broad offering of endomechanical products. The electrosurgical offering consists of monopolar and bipolar generators, argon beam coagulation generators, handpieces, smoke management systems and other accessories.

Our competition includes Boston Scientific Corporation - Endoscopy; Cook Medical, Inc.; Merit Medical Endotek; Olympus, Inc.; STERIS Corporation - U.S. Endoscopy and Cantel Medical- Medivators, Inc., Cardinal and 3M Company.
International
Expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth plan. Our products are sold in over 100 foreign countries. International sales efforts are coordinated through local country dealers (including sub-distributors or sales agents) or through direct in-country sales. We distribute our products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  In these countries, our sales are denominated in the local currency and amounted to approximately 34% of our total net sales in 2020.  In the remaining countries where our products are sold through independent distributors, sales are denominated in United States dollars. 
Competition
We compete in orthopedic and general surgery medical device markets across the world. Our competitors range from large manufacturers with multiple business units to smaller manufacturers with limited product offerings. We believe we have appropriate product offerings and adequate market share to compete effectively in these markets. The global markets are constantly changing due to technological advances. We seek to closely align our research and development with our key business objectives, namely developing and improving products and processes, applying innovative technology to the manufacture of products for new global markets and reducing the cost of producing core products. 
The breadth of our product lines in our key product areas enables us to meet a wide range of customer requirements and preferences.  This has enhanced our ability to market our products to surgeons, hospitals, surgery centers, group purchasing organizations ("GPOs"), integrated delivery networks ("IDNs") and other customers, particularly as institutions seek to reduce costs and minimize the number of suppliers.
Marketing
A significant portion of our products are distributed domestically directly to more than 6,000 hospitals, surgery centers and other healthcare institutions as well as through medical specialty distributors.  We are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
A significant portion of our U.S. sales are to customers affiliated with GPOs, IDNs and other large national or regional accounts, as well as to the Veterans Administration and other hospitals operated by the Federal government.  For hospital inventory management purposes, some of our customers prefer to purchase our products through independent third-party medical product distributors.
Our employee sales representatives are extensively trained in our various product offerings. Each employee sales representative is assigned a defined geographic area and compensated on a commission basis or through a combination of salary and commission.  The sales force is supervised and supported by either area directors or district managers.  In certain

geographies, sales agent groups are used in the United States to sell our orthopedic products.  These sales agent groups are paid a commission for sales made to customers while home office sales and marketing management provide the overall direction and training for marketing and positioning of our products. Our sales professionals provide surgeons and other healthcare professionals with information relating to the technical features and benefits of our products.
Our healthcare systems organization is responsible for interacting with large regional and national accounts (e.g. GPOs, IDNs, etc.).  We have contracts with many such organizations and believe that the loss of any individual group purchasing contract would not materially impact our business.
We sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and, therefore, believe there is no material concentration of credit risk.
Manufacturing
Raw material costs constitute a substantial portion of our cost of production.  Substantially all of our raw materials and select components used in the manufacturing process are procured from external suppliers.  Where possible, we work closely with multiple suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability.  As a consequence of supply chain best practices, new product development and acquisitions, we often form strategic partnerships with key suppliers. As a result, components and raw materials may be sole sourced. Due to the strength of these suppliers and the variety of products we provide, we do not believe the risk of supplier interruption poses an overall material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance. We schedule production and seek to maintain adequate levels of safety stock based on a number of factors, including experience, knowledge of customer ordering patterns, demand, manufacturing lead times and optimal quantities required to maintain the highest possible service levels.  Customer orders are generally processed for immediate shipment and backlog of firm orders is therefore not generally material to an understanding of our business. 
Research and Development
New and improved products play a critical role in our continued sales growth.  Internal research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and product technological and design improvements aimed at complementing and expanding existing product lines.  We continually seek to leverage new technologies which improve the durability, performance and usability of existing products.  In addition, we maintain close working relationships with surgeons, inventors and other healthcare professionals who often make new product and technology disclosures, principally in procedure-specific areas.  In certain cases, we seek to obtain rights to these ideas through negotiated agreements.  Such agreements typically compensate the originator through payments based upon a percentage of licensed product net sales.  Annual royalty expense approximated $1.5 million, $2.0 million and $1.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Amounts expended for Company research and development were approximately $40.5 million, $45.5 million and $42.2 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights, in general, are important to our business. We have rights to intellectual property, including United States patents and foreign equivalent patents which cover a wide range of our products with expiration dates from 2021 to 2040.  We own a majority of these patents and have exclusive and non-exclusive licensing rights to the remainder.  We believe that the development of new products and technological and design improvements to existing products will continue to be important to our competitive position.
Government Regulation and Quality Systems
The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and comparable foreign counterparts.  In the United States, these regulations were enacted under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder. 
The FDA’s Quality System Regulations set forth requirements for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, provide for on-site inspection of our facilities and continuing review by the FDA.  Many of our products are also subject to industry-defined standards.  Authorization to commercially market our products in the U.S. is granted by the FDA under a procedure referred to as a 510(k) pre-market notification and clearance.  We believe that our products and processes presently meet applicable standards in all material respects.
Medical device regulations continue to evolve world-wide.  Products marketed in the European Union and other countries require preparation of technical files and design dossiers which demonstrate compliance with applicable international regulations. As government regulations continue to change, there is a risk that the distribution of some of our products may be interrupted or discontinued if they do not meet the country specific requirements.
We market our products in numerous foreign countries and therefore are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, sterilization, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import laws and on-site inspection by independent bodies with the authority to issue or not issue certifications we may require to be able to sell products in certain countries.  Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.  The member countries of the European Union (“EU”) follow the requirements under the European Medical Device Directives ("EU MDD"), which create a single set of medical device regulations for all member countries.  In addition, the EU enacted the EU Medical Device Regulation ("EU MDR") in May 2017 that replaces the EU MDD. EU MDR becomes effective beginning in May 2021 and continuing through May 2023, depending on the device class, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post-market surveillance. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in the European Union to maintain quality system certifications through European Union recognized Notified Bodies.  These Notified Bodies authorize the use of the CE Mark allowing free movement of our products throughout the member countries.  Requirements pertaining to our products vary widely from country to country, ranging from simple product registrations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA.  We believe that our products and quality procedures currently meet applicable standards for the countries in which they are marketed.
As noted above, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and foreign regulatory agencies or notified bodies for, among other things, conformance to Quality System Regulation and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”) requirements and foreign or international standards. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. 
We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally, as are our suppliers and sterilization service providers. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect internal compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net income or our competitive position. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion of the use of outside EtO sterilization service providers.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,400 full-time employees, including approximately 2,100 in operations, 180 in research and development and the remaining in sales, marketing and related administrative support. 
CONMED's Vision is to empower healthcare providers worldwide to deliver positive outcomes for patients. We know that our people are our most important assets and a key part of the focus behind our CONMED Vision. Accordingly, the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented employees at all levels of our organization who are empowered to deliver positive results. To deliver on our human capital needs, we have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures align with our corporate pillars and are advanced through various programs and policies including the following:
Talent Management and Succession Planning
The Board is actively engaged and involved in talent management. The Board reviews the Company’s people strategy in support of its business strategy at least annually and frequently discusses talent issues at its meetings. This includes a detailed discussion of the Company’s global leadership bench and succession plans with a focus on key positions at the senior executive level. High-potential leaders are given exposure and visibility to Board members through formal presentations and informal events. More broadly, the Board is regularly updated on key talent indicators for the overall workforce, including diversity, recruiting and development programs.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with CONMED’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve positive results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Our compensation programs are evaluated regularly not only for market competitiveness but as importantly for equality and fairness.
Diversity and Inclusion
A demonstrated commitment to diversity and inclusion is vital to CONMED's success as we seek out individuals who bring their unique capabilities to our Company. At CONMED, we believe that diverse teams stimulate innovation, enhance our understanding of the needs of our global customer base and ultimately deliver better results for our stakeholders. We value individual strengths and are committed to hiring and retaining employees of all different backgrounds and experiences. We also recognize that while representation of diversity in the workforce is not enough to have the impact desired because inclusion is also an imperative, tracking representation of diversity in our workforce helps us to understand where our opportunities exist. These metrics are reviewed on a regular basis at the senior executive level.
Training, Development and Retention
We offer formal in person and e-learning training as well as tuition reimbursement programs to support our culture, strategy and ensure the development of key skills. In addition, we conduct anonymous employee engagement surveys and initiatives on a regular basis the results of which are reviewed both at the individual manager level and corporate wide at the senior executive level to continuously drive and support employee engagement. Finally, we track critical metrics including workforce planning needs and employee turnover, the results of which are reviewed on a regular basis at the senior executive level.
