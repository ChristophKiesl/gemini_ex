While the Company’s operations are principally located outside the United States, we utilize various consultants located in the United States, we participate in a global supply chain, and the existence of a worldwide pandemic, the fear associated with COVID-19, or any, pandemic, and the reactions of governments around the world in response to COVID-19, or any, pandemic, to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers’ or customers’ supply chains and business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of supplier and manufacturer facilities, interruptions in the supply of raw materials and components, personnel absences, or restrictions on the shipment of our or our suppliers’ or customers’ products, any of which could have adverse ripple effects on our manufacturing output and delivery schedule. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Description of Product or Services
 
We provide portals (similar to Amazon, Inc.) for the sale of products offered by reliable manufacturers and merchants at competitive prices. Products run the gamut from electronics to daily consumable products, food and clothing. We purchase goods according to market demand, directly from manufacturers that we have standing relationships with. The goods we source include, but are not limited to, electronic products, daily consumer goods such as shampoo and toothpaste, and various other items.
 
We then sell the goods we purchase, as well as products from other reliable merchants, to our various customers. Our Company is similar to a wholesaler in that our customers purchase goods from us bulk. We aim to effectively organize suppliers, manufacturers and distributors in order to minimize the costs of the whole supply chain system and offer competitive prices. Our Company does not warehouse or store any of the good we purchase. If the manufacturer we purchase from is not able to ship the goods directly to our customers, then our Company manages the logistics and arranges for a third-party shipping company.
 
Our Company actively cooperates with other listed or state-owned enterprises. On May 23, 2022, we entered into a commodity purchase contract, through Yiwu Tianqi Enterprise Management Co., Ltd., with Kunming Pharmaceutical Group, a state-owned enterprise. We also engage with companies whose products we feel are of good quality and that also need new channels, specifically social e-commerce. We cooperate with these companies so that they can expand their sales and supplies by offering our products and services on their sites
 
Target Market and Clients/Potential Clients
 
Our current target market is China, where we engage in e-commerce services. In recent years, with the rapid rise of social e-commerce, the Company began to diversify. Our sales channels have gradually changed from offline to online and from a single product sales business into a more comprehensive business of supply chain management.
 
The products supplied through our channels are high-quality and readily available products offered by a significant number of registered companies to members on our sales portals. At this date, we have over 500,000 registered and active members. We also do online market promotion through our online shopping malls and membership networks, word of mouth and social media such as WeChat. We also intend to offer products through offline stores and customer service centers. It is our goal to build the strongest Internet shopping channel in China.
 
During the initial phase of our development, our main target clients were individual users that browse internet on a daily basis. Beginning in January 2022, our second and current phase of business development is focusing on growth through providing services and products to small companies. If we succeed with these smaller companies, we intend to offer our products and services to medium sized corporations.
 
Sources of Revenue
 
Our revenue is generated in three main areas: traditional trade sales, which are sales to physical, offline stores; online wholesale sales, which are sales to online sellers; and sales of services which provide enterprises with marketing and promotion related services such as providing live broadcasting resources, technical services, and promotional services, among others.

We have identified three main marketing client groups associated with the various streams of revenue: individual users of personal computers and other internet enabled devices, and medium sized companies.
 
We are marketing to personal computing and other internet enabled device users with our WebMall sales and service. As of 2021, there were 340 million sales of personal computers and internet enabled devices, and several billion are expected over the next three to five years. Capturing a small sector of this user population could allow us to sell our products and services at a very attractive and affordable prices.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Within the next six months, we will provide services to a variety of locales in China. Zhejiang is the center of China, and we have estimated that 80% of our members are in Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Fujian and other provinces. Our members include users who register with us through email. The services we intend to provide are traditional trade sales, which are sales to physical, offline stores; online wholesale sales, which are sales to online sellers; and sales of services which provide enterprises with marketing and promotion related services such as providing live broadcasting resources, technical services, and promotional services, among others.
 
Once we have a core of business in China, we plan to expand to Southeast Asia, Europe and Latin America in over the next five to six years.
 
Competition
 
Currently, our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations. There are currently in the market larger and better-financed companies providing similar services.
 
The online sales industry is highly competitive. We compete with other numerous other firms, including larger regional, national and international firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Among these competitors are Amazon, Inc., Alibaba, Jingdong, and PinDuoDuo. Competitive factors include the level of technical expertise and experience, industry reputation, quality of work, price, geographic presence, dependability, availability of skilled personnel and financial stability. Our management believes that we can compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that our business model provides certain competitive advantages:
 

● | Offering free membership to consumers who utilize our services, including preferential shipping; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Offering a sharing of the economic benefits by offering discounts and rebates to regular customers; and 
● | Providing superior customer services through all sales portals and physical locations. 

Employees
 
As of October 28, 2022, we had 50 employees, all of whom were full-time.
 
Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate additional revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.

One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund to keep operation, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, as of the time of the filing of this Report, many states in the United States are still experiencing high rates of infection and many countries around the world, including the United States and China, have taken steps to restrict travel. The existence of a worldwide pandemic, the fear associated with COVID-19, or any, pandemic, and the reactions of governments in response to COVID-19, or any, pandemic, to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the markets in which we operate. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
