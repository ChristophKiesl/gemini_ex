ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated in November 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that we have not yet identified (the “Initial Business Combination”). We have not entered into a definitive agreements with any specific Initial Business Combination target.



While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business in the software and tech-enabled services sectors. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value between $750 million and $3 billion.



Our registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on February 1, 2021. On February 4, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 24,150,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), including 3,150,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the “Over-Allotment Units”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $241.5 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $14.4 million, inclusive of approximately $9.1 million for deferred underwriting commissions.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 4,553,334 warrants (each, a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $6.8 million.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, $241.5 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a Trust Account (“Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an Initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.



Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating an Initial Business Combination. Our Initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time we sign a definitive agreement in connection with the Initial Business Combination. However, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

We consummated our Initial Public Offering on February 4, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from November 4, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2022 related to our formation and the Initial Public Offering, and since the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective Initial Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.



We will provide the holders of our Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of an Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters.



If we are unable to complete an Initial Business Combination prior to September 4, 2023 (the “Combination Period”), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Recent Developments



Proposed Business Combination



On March 20, 2023, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with our Sponsor, Braiin Limited, an Australian public company limited by shares (“Braiin”), and certain Braiin shareholders (the “Braiin Supporting Shareholders”) who collectively own 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Braiin (the “Braiin Shares”). Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, a business combination between NRAC and Braiin (the “Business Combination”) will be effected as a share exchange in which Braiin shareholders exchange 100% of their Braiin Shares for a pro rata portion of Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of NRAC (the “Class A Ordinary Shares”) with an aggregate value of $190 million (the “Share Exchange”). The number of shares to be issued will be based upon a per share value of $10.00. The aggregate value is subject to adjustment up or down based upon certain indebtedness and cash on hand of Braiin as set forth in its audited financial statements. Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, Braiin will acquire PowerTec Holdings Ltd., an Australian distributor that supplies connectivity solutions to individuals and businesses around the world. (“PowerTec”). Following the Share Exchange, Braiin will continue as a subsidiary of the Company, and the Company will change its name to “Braiin Holdings.” We refer to NRAC after giving effect to the Business Combination, as “New Braiin.”



Simultaneously with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, NRAC and Braiin entered into separate support agreements with the Braiin Supporting Shareholders and the Sponsor pursuant to which the Braiin Supporting Shareholders and the Sponsor have agreed to vote their Braiin shares and NRAC shares, respectively, in favor of the Business Combination and against any competing acquisition proposal, and not to solicit any competing acquisition proposal. In addition, the Sponsor has agreed to surrender 1,500,000 NRAC founder shares immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”) and to waive: (i) redemption rights with respect to its NRAC shares in connection with the Business Combination, and (ii) the right to have any working capital loans extended to NRAC converted into warrants.



In connection with the Business Combination, on March 16, 2023, NRAC and Braiin entered into an OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”) with certain funds managed by Meteora Capital, LLC, an investor in the Sponsor (the “Meteora Funds”).

Shareholder Meeting



On January 27, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders where the shareholders approved a special resolution to amend our Amended andRestated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Extension Amendment”) to extend the date by which the company may either (i) consummate a merger, shareexchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganisation or similar business combination, from February 4, 2023 to September 4, 2023 (such later date, the “extended date”) or such earlier date as determined by the board or (ii) cease its operations, except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete an initial businesscombination, and (iii) redeem all of the Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of the company, included as part of the units sold in the company’s InitialPublic Offering that was consummated on February 4, 2021 from February 4, 2023 to September 4, 2023 or such earlier date as determined by the board.



On March 16, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders where the shareholders approved: (i) a special resolution, to amend our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “charter”) to change the name of the company from Noble Rock Acquisition Corporation to Northern Revival Acquisition Corporation (the “Name Change Proposal”); and (ii) a special resolution, to amend the charter to change certain provisions which restrict our Class B ordinary shares from converting to Class A ordinary shares prior to the closing of the business combination (the “Conversion Proposal”). On February 9, 2023, certain officers and directors of the company resigned, a new management team was appointed and we agreed to change our name in connection with these changes. The purpose of the Name Change Proposal was to amend the name of the company accordingly. The purpose of the Conversion Proposal was to remove restrictions contained in the charter in order to permit the Class B ordinary shares to convert into Class A ordinary shares prior to the closing of the business combination which will enable the company to meet certain Nasdaq listing requirements. The holders of such shares will continue to be subject to the same restrictions as the Class B ordinary shares before any conversion, including, among others, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of a business combination as described in the prospectus for our initial public offering.



In connection with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Extension Amendment, holders of 21,240,830 Class A ordinary shares of our then24,150,000 Class A ordinary shares outstanding with redemption rights, elected to redeem their shares at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.17. In connection with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Conversion Proposal, holders of 433,699 Class A ordinary shares of our then-outstanding 8,946,670 Class A ordinary shares outstanding with redemption rights, elected to redeem their shares at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.33. On March 28, 2023, the Company elected to permit one shareholder, at the shareholder’s request, to reverse their redemption as to 5,000 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in a total of 428,699 redemptions in connection with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Conversion Proposal. On April 5, 2023, the Sponsor elected to convert 6,037,499 Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares. Following such meetings and the redemptions related thereto and the conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, there are a total of 8,517,970 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, and (ii) one Class B ordinary shares As of April 27, 2023 there was a total of approximately $25.8 million held in the trust account.



As previously disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Extension Proposal, the Sponsor has indicated that, it will contribute to theCompany as a loan (each loan being referred to herein as a “contribution”) the lesser of (i) $100,000 and (ii) an aggregate amount equal to $0.055 multiplied by thenumber of public shares of the Company that are not redeemed, for each month commencing on February 4, 2023 and on or prior to the fourth day of each subsequentmonth, if applicable (each such month period an “extension period) until the earlier of (x) the date of the extraordinary general meeting held in connection with ashareholder vote to approve an Initial Business Combination (y) the extended date and (z) the date that the board determines in its sole discretion to no longer seek anInitial Business Combination. Each contribution will be deposited in the trust account within three business days of the beginning of the extended period which suchcontribution is for. The contributions will be repayable by the company to the Sponsor upon consummation of an Initial Business Combination. The Company’s board ofdirectors will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional extension periods, and if the board determines not to continue extending for additionalmonths, the additional contributions will terminate. If this occurs, the Company would wind up the Company’s affairs and redeem 100% of the outstanding public sharesin accordance with the procedures set forth in the company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (“Charter”). The Sponsor contributed to the Company as a loan the first, second and third deposits of $100,000 each into the Trust Account on February 4, 2023, March 4, 2023 and April 4, 2023.



Nasdaq Letter



On April 4, 2023, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the letter, the Company’s Minimum Market Value of Listed Securities (“MVLS”) was less than $35.0 million, which does not meet the requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) (the “MVLS Rule”). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), Nasdaq has provided the Company with 180 calendar days, or until October 3, 2023, to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule. The MVLS Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market.



Our Sponsor, the holder of our Class B ordinary shares, agreed to convert 6,037,499 of its Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares which the Company believes will allow it to regain compliance with the MVLS requirement. On a pro forma basis, based on the closing stock price of the Class A ordinary shares on April 4, 2023 of $10.27, this conversion would increase the MVLS by approximately $62 million. In order for the Company to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule, the Company’s MVLS must equal or exceed $35.0 million for at least 10 consecutive trading days however and Nasdaq must provide written confirmation to the Company to close the matter.



In the event the Company does not regain compliance with the MVLS Rule prior to the expiration of the compliance period, it will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.

Business Combination Agreement

The number of shares to be issued will be based upon a per share value of $10.00. The aggregate value is subject to adjustment up or down based upon certain indebtedness and cash on hand of Braiin as set forth in its audited financial statements. Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, Braiin will acquire PowerTec, an Australian distributor that supplies connectivity solutions to individuals and businesses around the world.

Entities and funds managed by Meteora own equity interests in the Sponsor.



The Forward Purchase Agreement was entered into on March 16, 2023, prior to the signing and announcement of the Business Combination Agreement. Pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement, Meteora has agreed to make purchases of Class A Ordinary Shares of NRAC: (a) in open-market purchases through a broker after the date of NRAC’s redemption deadline in connection with the vote of NRAC shareholders to approve the Business Combination from holders of Class A Ordinary Shares of NRAC, including those who elect to redeem Class A Ordinary Shares and subsequently revoked their prior elections to redeem (the “Recycled Shares”) and (b) directly from NRAC, newly-issued Class A Ordinary Shares of NRAC (the “Additional Shares” and, together with the Recycled Shares, the “Subject Shares”).

The Forward Purchase Agreement provides that no later than the earlier of (a) one business day after the closing of the Business Combination and (b) the date any assets from NRAC’s trust account are disbursed in connection with the Business Combination, the Combined Company will pay to Meteora, out of funds held in its Trust Account, an amount (the “Prepayment Amount”) equal to (x) the per-share redemption price (the “Initial Price”) multiplied by (y) the number of Recycled Shares on the date of such prepayment less the Prepayment Shortfall. The Prepayment Shortfall is equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent of the product of (x) the Number of NRAC Class A Ordinary Shares multiplied by (y) the Initial Price and (ii) $3,000,000.



Meteora may, at its discretion and at any time following the closing of the Business Combination, provide an Optional Early Termination notice (“OET Notice”) and pay to the Combined Company the product of the “Reset Price” and the number of NRAC’s Class A Ordinary Shares listed on the OET Notice. The Reset Price shall initially equal the Initial Price but shall be adjusted on the first scheduled trading date of each two-week period commencing on the first week following the 30th day after the closing of the Business Combination to the lowest of (i) the current Reset Price, (ii) the Initial Price and (iii) the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of NRAC’s Class A Ordinary Shares of the prior two week period.



The Forward Purchase Agreement matures on the earlier to occur of (a) three years after the closing of the Business Combination, (b) the date specified by Meteora in a written notice delivered at Meteora’s discretion if (i) the VWAP of NRAC’s Class A Ordinary Shares during 10 out of 30 consecutive trading days is at or below $5.00 per Share, or (ii) the Shares are delisted from a national securities exchange. At maturity, Meteora will be entitled to receive maturity consideration in cash or shares. The maturity consideration will equal the product of (1) (a) the Number of NRAC Class A Ordinary Shares less (b) the number of Terminated Shares, multiplied by (2) $1.50 in the event of cash or, in the event of NRAC Class A Ordinary Shares, $2.00; and $2.50, solely in the event of a registration failure.



The Forward Purchase Agreement has been structured, and all activity in connection with such agreement has been undertaken, to comply with the requirements of all tender offer regulations applicable to the Business Combination, including Rule 14e-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



The Forward Purchase Agreement may be terminated by any of the parties thereto if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms prior to the closing of the Business Combination.



NRAC has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Meteora, its affiliates, assignees and other parties described therein (the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities under the Forward Purchase Agreement (excluding liabilities relating to the manner in which Meteora sells any shares it owns) and reimburse the Indemnified Parties for their reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such liabilities, subject to certain exceptions described therein, and has agreed to contribute to any amounts required to be paid by any Indemnified Parties if such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to hold such party harmless.



Joseph Tonnos, a Principal and Associate Portfolio Manager at Meteora Capital, LLC, an investor in the Sponsor, served on the NRAC board of directors from February 9, 2023 until his resignation on March 15, 2023. Mr. Tonnos promptly disclosed this conflict of interest to the board of directors of NRAC and refrained from participating in any discussions or any vote regarding the Forward Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated therein. Mr. Tonnos resigned from the NRAC board of directors prior to any approval of the Forward Purchase Agreement. Such resignation was not a result of disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices.



Our Business Strategy



Our board and advisory team will leverage their long-standing partnerships, vast investment experience, deep networks, and technology industry expertise to identify and generate attractive acquisition opportunities among middle-market technology companies with anticipated enterprise values between $750 million and $3 billion. To the extent the purchase price for any acquisition to be paid in cash exceeds the net proceeds available to us, we may issue debt or equity to consummate the acquisition. Such additional financing may come in the form of bank financings or preferred equity, common equity or debt offerings, or a combination of the foregoing.



We believe our management team’s experience and track record, are differentiated and will enable us to successfully identify and execute an Initial Business Combination. We will leverage our extensive network of relationships across the middle-market technology ecosystem to assist in the identification of a target for the Initial Business Combination.

The past performance of our management team or their respective affiliates, is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any Initial Business Combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our Initial Business Combination. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team’s or their respective affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance. Our management team and their respective affiliates have been involved with a large number of public and private companies in addition to those identified above, not all of which have achieved similar performance levels. See “Item 1.A. Risk Factors — Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business that we may acquire.”



Initial Business Combination Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we expect to identify companies that have compelling growth potential and a combination of the characteristics detailed below. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies or assets that we believe have the following attributes:

● | B2B and B2B2C software and tech-enabled services businesses. We will focus on companies that are reshaping business information technology by providing critical, high-value-add solutions via software or tech-enabled services. We believe such companies are benefiting from the digitalization, cloud-migration, and proliferation of data across the enterprise.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Healthy end markets with strong long-term secular trends. We will target companies that operate in markets with attractive long-term growth prospects and reasonable overall size or potential.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Minimal technology risk with high switching costs. We will evaluate companies that provide or automate core solutions required to operate a business in their target markets, and whose solutions are difficult to displace due to their mission-critical nature. These solutions are characterized by systemic integration within end customer organizations, competitive differentiation and insulation from future disruptive technologies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consistent and compelling growth prospects and significant recurring revenues. We will evaluate companies with attractive growth vectors that demonstrate a high level of recurring revenue and strong customer retention rates. We will seek companies that have the ability to generate strong revenue growth through new customer acquisition, cross-selling to existing customers, and acquisitions of complementary companies and products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive, inherently profitable businesses with high operating leverage. We will evaluate companies that we believe possess not only an established business model and sustainable competitive advantages, but also inherently profitable unit economics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Knowledgeable management teams with relevant industry experience and a proven track record. We will target companies with expert management teams that have specialized knowledge of their respective industry sector and are active leaders in developing or deploying technology to provide a solution for a problem or challenge within their respective industry sector.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Established business models. We will target companies with proven business models and a demonstrated ability to scale by extending product portfolios into new markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from being a public company. We will focus on companies that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize access to capital and the public profile associated with being a publicly-traded company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Platform that can become a consolidator. We will focus on companies that can benefit from our team’s experience driving growth through strategic add-on acquisitions. These companies are typically in fragmented markets with many participants offering overlapping solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review, which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with members of the target’s management and other employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry.

Certain of our directors and officers indirectly own founder shares and/or Private Placement Warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Initial Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination.



Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present an Initial Business Combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an Initial Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Initial Business Combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. Additionally, certain of our directors and officers are now, and our Sponsor, directors and officers may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business.



Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq listing rules require that our Initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). We refer to this as the 80% fair market value test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.



We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our Initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our Initial Business Combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If our Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.

Departure of certain officers and directors; name change and Class B conversion



On February 9, 2023, in accordance with the provisions of a binding agreement that provides for the withdrawal or significant reduction in investment in the Sponsor by certain existing investors and the resulting transfer of control of the Sponsor: (i) Whitney Bower resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, (ii) Peter Low resigned as Chief Financial Officer and director and (iii) Michael Alter and David Lang resigned as independent directors, (iv) the board appointed Aemish Shah as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Manpreet Singh as Chief Financial Officer and a director, and also appointed Joseph Tonnos, David Tanzer and Asad Zafar to serve as directors, determining each of Messrs. Tonnos, Tanzer and Zafar to be an independent director under the listing rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. We agreed to change our name in connection with these changes. Mr. Tonnos served on the NRAC board of directors from February 9, 2023 until his resignation on March 15, 2023. Such resignation was not a result of disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices.



On March 16, 2023, we held our General Meeting for the purposes of considering and voting upon: (i) a special resolution, to amend our charter to change the name of the company from Noble Rock Acquisition Corporation to Northern Revival Acquisition Corporation; and (ii) a special resolution, to amend the charter to change certain provisions which restrict our Class B ordinary shares from converting to Class A ordinary shares prior to the closing of the business combination. Both the Name Change Proposal and Conversion Proposal were approved by the shareholders at the General Meeting. The purpose of the Name Change Proposal was to amend the name of the company as agreed in connection with the departures of Messrs. Bower, Low, Alter and Lang. The purpose of the Conversion Proposal was to remove restrictions contained in the charter in order to permit the Class B ordinary shares to convert into Class A ordinary shares prior to the closing of the business combination which will enable the company to meet certain Nasdaq listing requirements. The holders of such shares will continue to be subject to the same restrictions as the Class B ordinary shares before any conversion, including, among others, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of a business combination as described in the prospectus for our initial public offering.



Extension, redemptions and contributions



On January 27, 2023, we held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders where the shareholders approved a special resolution to amend our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Extension Amendment”) to extend the date by which the company may either (i) consummate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganisation or similar business combination, from February 4, 2023 to September 4, 2023 (such later date, the “extended date”) or such earlier date as determined by the board or (ii) cease its operations, except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete an initial business combination, and (iii) redeem all of the Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of the company, included as part of the units sold in the company’s Initial Public Offering that was consummated on February 4, 2021 from February 4, 2023 to September 4, 2023 or such earlier date as determined by the board.



In connection with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Extension Amendment, holders of 21,240,830 Class A ordinary shares of our then 24,150,000 Class A ordinary shares outstanding with redemption rights, elected to redeem their shares at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.17. In connection with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Conversion Proposal, holders of 433,699 Class A ordinary shares of our then outstanding 8,946,670 Class A ordinary shares outstanding with redemption rights, elected to redeem their shares at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.33. On March 28, 2023, the Company elected to permit one shareholder, at the shareholder’s request, to reverse their redemption as to 5,000 Class A ordinary shares, resulting in a total of 428,699 redemptions in connection with the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Conversion Proposal. On April 5, 2023, the Sponsor elected to convert 6,037,499 Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares. Following such meetings and the redemptions related thereto and the conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, there are a total of 8,517,970 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding and (ii) one Class B ordinary share outstanding. As of April 27, 2023, there was a total of approximately $25.8 million held in the trust account.



As previously disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Extension Proposal, the Sponsor has indicated that, it will contribute to the Company as a loan (each loan being referred to herein as a “contribution”) the lesser of (i) $100,000 and (ii) an aggregate amount equal to $0.055 multiplied by the number of public shares of the Company that are not redeemed, for each month commencing on February 4, 2023 and on or prior to the fourth day of each subsequent month, if applicable (each such month period an “extension period) until the earlier of (x) the date of the extraordinary general meeting held in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an Initial Business Combination (y) the extended date and (z) the date that the board determines in its sole discretion to no longer seek an Initial Business Combination. Each contribution will be deposited in the trust account within three business days of the beginning of the extended period which such contribution is for. The contributions will be repayable by the company to the Sponsor upon consummation of an Initial Business Combination. The Company’s board of directors will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional extension periods, and if the board determines not to continue extending for additional months, the additional contributions will terminate. If this occurs, the Company would wind up the Company’s affairs and redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in the company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (“Charter”). The Sponsor contributed to the Company as a loan the first, second and third deposits of $100,000 each into the Trust Account on February 4, 2023, March 4, 2023 and April 4, 2023.

Competition



We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Initial Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Initial Business Combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.
Human Capital Management



We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Initial Business Combination process.
Item 1.B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
None.
