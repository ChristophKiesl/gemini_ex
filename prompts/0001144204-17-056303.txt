ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (referred to herein, unless otherwise indicated, as “the Company,” “CTi,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a Nevada corporation originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. We are a process and product development firm that has developed, patented, and commercialized environmentally friendly technology based systems that are designed to serve large, growing, global markets such as vegetable oil refining, renewable fuels, water treatment, wines and spirits enhancement, algae oil extraction, water-oil emulsions and crude oil yield improvement.  Our systems are designed to process industrial liquids at a reduced processing time, lower operating cost, improved yield while operating in environmentally friendly manner. We have developed, patented, and commercialized our proprietary technology that can be used in multiple liquid processing applications. Our patented Nano Reactor® is the critical component of our CTi Nano Neutralization® System which has been shown to reduce operating costs and increase yields in refining vegetable oils.
 
Vegetable Oil Refining 
 
Our first commercial application for our technology has been the CTi Nano Neutralization® System which has been utilized to improve edible vegetable oil refining process. Our environmentally friendly process has been shown to reduce refining costs, increase oil yield, and limit the amount of chemical additives used in chemical refining of vegetables oils. This patented process (US Patent # 7,762,715 and # 8,042,989) is designed to be incorporated into new and existing soybean, rapeseed, and canola oil chemical refineries.
 
Our first pilot test of our CTi NANO Neutralization System was conducted in 2010 at Carolina Soya, a 200-metric ton/day crude soy oil refining plant in Estill, South Carolina. Our second system, which became operational in fiscal 2011, has been continuously utilized since 2011 at the plant that processes approximately 450 metric tons per day of soy oil. Further, we have successfully shipped over 30 systems both domestically and abroad. We also continuously focus on developing additional Nano Reactor® applications and managing the intellectual property issues associated with new processes and applications.
 
The global demand for vegetable oils has grown consistently at a rate of about 5.5% p.a. from 84.5 million metric tons in 1999 to over 175 million metric tons in 2015-2016 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263937/vegetable-oils-global-consumption/). It is also a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage.
 
Desmet Ballestra Agreement 
 
On May 14, 2012 we signed a global R and D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group s.a. (Desmet), a Belgian company that is actively marketing the NANO Neutralization System, the key component of which is our Nano Reactor® to soybean and other vegetable oil refiners. The Agreement provided Desmet (licensee) a limited, exclusive license and right to develop, design and supply our NANO Neutralization System which incorporates Nano Reactor® devices on a global basis tools and fats and oleo chemical applications Desmet provided, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $125,000 against future sales to us through May 2015. This Agreement was terminated in May 2015.
 
On January 22, 2016, we signed a similar three-year agreement with Desmet effective August 1, 2015. As part of the agreement, Desmet is to provide, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of $50,000 against future sales to us. The agreement expires in August 2018 or may be terminated by Desmet every August 1 should Desmet and its affiliates fail to convert a minimum of six NANO Neutralization Systems to sold status during the period of June 1 to May 31. The agreement may also be terminated in case we were to lose our rights under the patents and patent applications being used in our CTi NANO Neutralization System.
 
Desmet, together with its affiliates, is a global engineering and equipment supply firm engaged in the development, design and supply of process equipment for oils and fats processing facilities including vegetable oil refining, biofuel, oleo chemical, seed crushing, surfactant and detergent markets. Desmet supplies these markets with services based on the latest globally sourced technologies. Desmet has relationships with major refiners globally A significant portion of global vegetable oil refineries include major refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, Inc. and Bunge Limited. Desmet has more than 40 sales representatives selling in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Since its founding in 1946, Desmet reports that it has built a global network that includes 1,300 employees, 17 global and 8 representative offices, and more than 5,700 lines in a variety of applications. Desmet operates a separate division for each of the above markets and the Desmet Oils & Fats division has supplied small and large plants to approximately 1,700 oil millers in 150 countries, covering over 6,000 process sections. We have developed a relationship with the North American arm of Desmet which operates in each of these markets and provides us with other potential opportunities such as palm oil refining.

We and Desmet have worked together to determine the appropriate sales approach and installation process. Our CTi Nano Neutralization System is designed to be used as an add-on process to an existing neutralization system within soybean and other vegetable oil refineries. Desmet is now focused on marketing our CTi’s Nano Neutralization® System to vegetable oil refiners to help them increase profits through cost savings and improved oil yields. Desmet purchases our CTi Nano Neutralization Reactor Systems from us and installs them at the refinery as part of an integrated neutralization system. Based on successful commercial implementations, Desmet guarantees minimum economic benefits to a facility that installs our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems. We are therefore substantially dependent on Desmet to identify prospects, complete sales contracts, install the system and manage relationships with end-users.
 
GEA Westfalia Agreement
 
In August 2012, we entered into a Technology and Licensing Agreement with the GEA Group AG - Westfalia Separator Group (“GEA”) pursuant to which the companies agreed to jointly develop and patent new applications of our core technologies. As part of the Agreement, GEA Westfalia will assemble a complete commercial test system comprising Nano Reactors®. This Agreement was terminated in January 2017.
 
In January 2017 we have entered into a new global technology license, R&D and marketing agreement with respect to our patented Nano Reactor™ technology, processes and applications. Under the new agreement, GEA has been granted a worldwide exclusive license to integrate our patented technology into water treatment application, milk and juice pasteurization, and certain food related processes. The license agreement between us and GEA has a three-year term and provides for the payment of $300,000 per year in advanced license fees to us. As of June 30, 2017, the Company has not received any advances from GEA or recorded any revenues pursuant to this agreement. 
 
GEA Westfalia Separator manufactures filtration and equipment such as separators, clarifiers, decanters and membrane filtration systems. This equipment is used for the purification of suspensions, the separation of fluid mixtures with simultaneous removal of solids, extraction and concentration or removal of liquids from solids. The technological dominance of the company is based on over one hundred fifteen years of innovation, first-class engineering solutions and comprehensive processing capabilities. The company was founded in 1893 in Oelde, Germany, and since 1994 has been a part of the GEA Group AG and is a business unit within the GEA Mechanical Equipment segment. In 1950, Westfalia Separator established US and Canadian corporations to serve as sales and marketing arms to compete in the burgeoning North American market for centrifuges. GEA is one of the largest suppliers for the food processing industry and a wide range of process industries that generated consolidated revenues of approximately EUR 4.6 billion in 2015. As an international technology group, GEA focuses on process technology and components for sophisticated production processes in various end-user markets. The Group generates more than 70 percent of its revenue in the food sector that enjoys long-term sustainable growth. As of December 31, 2016, the Company employed about 17,000 people worldwide. GEA is a market and technology leader in its business areas. GEA is listed on the German MDAX (G1A, WKN 660 200). In addition, GEA’s share is a constituent of the MSCI Global Sustainability Indexes.
 
Customers Dependence
 
We continue to sell our CTi Nano Reactor® and Nano Reactor® Systems and technology only to two licensees, Desmet and GEA, and they are responsible for installing and servicing the systems. All of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was derived from sales of products to Desmet.
 
Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers
 
We have historically sourced reactor components from various domestic and international suppliers. We do not have any long-term contracts, agreements, or commitments with any supplier. We believe it would take approximately 30 days to find a new supplier, if necessary.
 
Competition
 
Our competitors who sell equipment and engineering services for the vegetable oil refining business are a myriad of companies both large and small that provide equipment and technology to oil refiners. These include known companies that have longer operating histories, more experience, and stronger financial capabilities. Competitors include Alfa Laval, and Crown Iron Works as well as many firms that provide advice and services to small and regional firms. In addition, Arisdyne Systems, a designer of cavitation devices, is marketing a system using similar technology. The vegetable oil refining business is a highly competitive commodity market in which where the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. We intend to compete by offering solutions that help our clients remain or become a low-cost producer. Because the industry in which we compete has had limited new technology introduced in the last 50 years, we believe our CTi Nano Neutralization® Systems provide a unique opportunity for refiners to increase margins. We seek to differentiate ourselves by offering solutions based on our proprietary and patented designs, processes, and applications to help our clients described in our issued and patent pending applications. We compete by offering solutions that we believe can reduce operating expenses and increase oil yield vs currently applied technologies

Patents
 
Our Cavitation Generator patent was issued during fiscal 2011. In addition, we have a patent for our Multi-Stage Cavitation Device that was issued on October 25, 2011. In the fiscal 2014 we received approvals for another apparatus patent and 2 additional process patents in the US. During fiscal years 2015 and 2016, we also received approvals in the US for another 5 patents for various processes. In fiscal year 2017, we received approvals in the US for 3 process patents and approval for a 4th process patent in fiscal year 2018.
 
In international applications, we received 1 patent approval for a process patent in Singapore in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2017, we received patent approvals for process patents in Mexico and Canada.
 
We also have 3 US and 7 international patent applications pending that apply to the design of our reactor and the processes involving use of the same. We filed a number of process patent applications incorporating these patented devices for processing fluids in vegetable oil refining, waste water treatment, algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement. We received comments from the United States Patent and Trademark Office with regards to our process for increasing bioalcohol yield from biomass and have responded. We also received comments in multiples of our international applications and are responding to those as well. There is no assurance that our patents pending will be ultimately issued.
 
We believe our technology can be applied to other liquid processing industries where there is a need to solve environmental problems, reduce operating costs, and/or improve quality and yield. Our issued patents, allowed patents, and pending applications support potential uses of the Company’s proprietary technology in markets that include, but are not limited to, vegetable oils refining, renewable fuel production, alcoholic beverage enhancement, water purification, and algae oil extraction. In addition, we believe our proprietary technology may also be applied to fuel mixing and crude oil refining. During fiscal 2011, we received the “CE Marking” certification which allows us to market our systems in the European Union. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurances that patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted hereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantage to us. We plan to continue to invest in R&D and file for new and improved patents.
 
 Royalty Agreements
 
On July 1, 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into Patent Assignment Agreements with two parties, our President as well as our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who currently serves as our Technology Senior Manager, where certain devices and methods involved in the hydrodynamic cavitation processes invented by the President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager have been assigned to the subsidiary.  In exchange, that subsidiary agreed to pay a royalty of 5% of gross revenues to each of the President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager for licensing of the technology and leasing of the related equipment embodying the technology. These agreements were subsequently assumed by us on May 13, 2010 from our subsidiary. Our former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager and President both waived their rights to receive royalty payments that have accrued, or that may accrue, on any gross revenue generated through June 30, 2017.
