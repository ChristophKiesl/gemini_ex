ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Startek, Inc. (“Startek”, the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a global business process management company for some of the world’s most iconic brands in a variety of  markets. Operating under the global Startek and Aegis brand, we help these large global companies connect emotionally with their customers, solve issues, and improve net promoter scores and other customer-facing performance metrics. Through consulting and analytics services, technology-led innovation, and engagement solutions and complete range of services around the customer life cycle management process (CLM). Our solutions are supported by over 47,000 employees, delivering services from 49 locations in 13 countries on five continents. Each day, our customer experience experts work together to deliver customer experiences that are personal, meaningful, and true to our clients’ brands.
 
The Company was founded in 1987. At that time, our business was centered on supply chain management services, which included packaging, fulfillment, marketing support and logistics services. After our initial public offering on June 19, 1997, we increasingly focused on operating customer care contact centers and grew to include our current suite of customer experience offerings. To help us remain strategically competitive while expanding our reach with new and existing clients, we acquired several companies from 2013 to 2015. On July 20, 2018, the Company acquired CSP Alpha Midco Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (“Aegis”), which resulted in CSP Alpha Holdings Parent Pte Ltd, a Singapore private limited company (“Capital Square Partners or CSP”) owning a majority of the Company's outstanding shares. Capital Square Partners, a Singapore based private equity fund, which owned Aegis, is now the majority shareholder in the Company, owning approximately 55% of our outstanding shares. For more details regarding our acquisition, please refer to Note 3 which forms part of notes to consolidated financial statement included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The combination greatly improved our competitive position in the market by providing us with access to many of the world’s most rapidly growing markets, multi-lingual offerings, a strong footprint, and the institution of operational excellence capabilities and industry best practices.
 
While we have customer engagement experience in almost every industry, we have developed tailored expertise in the telecom, media and cable, e-commerce and consumer, financial and business services and healthcare and education sectors. We serve approximately 225 clients globally, many of which are industry leaders in their respective verticals and geographies. We not only understand the industries in which our clients operate but also the unique challenges they face and the culture of the business or geography within which services are delivered. We believe our knowledge of best practices across different industries and an understanding of the solutions that can be implemented in the context of our clients’ operating environments enables us to improve processes and performance metrics and drive measurable results that differentiate our clients from their competitors. The trust and confidence that our clients have in us is understood by the long relationships we enjoy with many of our key clients, including servicing our top five clients for more than eight years on average.We hold the distinction of being a global company with a local flare that allows our customers determine efficiencies onshore, nearshore and off-shore. This multishare capability and capacity makes us a global brand allowing to craft customized experiences across cultures and continents.

Our Clients
 
We develop long-term relationships with global corporations and medium-sized businesses whose business complexities and customer focus require a strategic partner that can quickly and globally scale the tools, technology, and talent needed to design and deliver the desired customer experience. We provide these services to clients from our delivery campuses across North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had a diverse client base of more than 225 clients across a variety of verticals, including companies that we believe are among the leading players in their respective industries. Approximately 38% of our revenue is derived from clients within the telecommunications industry which has resulted in a rapidly evolving environment for service providers. Our focus is on the continued diversification of the industries we serve by targeting high growth verticals such as e-commerce and consumer, financial and business services, healthcare and education and travel and hospitality. Our revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 by industries served were as follows:
 

 | Twelve months ended December 31, 2019
----------------------------------+--------------------------------------
Telecom | 38% 
E-commerce & Consumer | 16% 
Financial & Business Services | 8% 
Media & Cable | 14% 
Travel & Hospitality | 11% 
Healthcare & Education | 7% 
Technology, IT & Related Services | 2% 
Others | 4% 

 
In the twelve months ending December 2019, our top five and ten clients represented 39% and 51% of total revenue, respectively.  We enter into Master Service Agreements (MSAs) that cover all our work for each client. These MSAs are typically multi-year contracts that may or may not include auto-renewal provisions. Although they typically do not include contractual minimum volumes and are generally terminable by the client without penalty upon prior written notice, our relationships with our top five clients have averaged around eight years, including multiple contract renewals for several of these clients.
 
Our clients’ customer experience needs continue to evolve and are expanding beyond basic order processing or first-tier calls to handling complex issues requiring advanced problem-solving skills, an in-depth understanding of their customers, sourcing the relevant technology capabilities to deliver personalized customer experience (CX), and building a highly-qualified talent pool for managing the customer experience. The digital outsourcing drivers for enterprises such as access to better technology, analytics, and omnichannel solutions are increasingly becoming more important than traditional outsourcing drivers. Our clients are looking to us to provide them with next generation technology solutions to help them solve key business problems. We are investing in digital solutions and automation technologies to unlock customer insights that is adjacent to world class customer experience using state of the art digital technologies.

Additionally, we also believe our innovative human capital strategies and operational best practices are key competitive advantages. The successful execution of our principal corporate strategies depends on our competitive strengths, which are briefly described below:

We will continue to invest in our core customer experience solutions, consulting and analytics capabilities, technology-enabled platform, and human communication science research to accelerate revenue growth across the globe.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business can be seasonal depending on our clients' marketing programs and product launches, which are often geared toward the end of summer and the winter holiday buying season in the United States and during major local festival seasons across our other geographies.
Industry
 
The worldwide customer management business process outsourcing ("CM BPO") market is projected to grow steadily at slightly above 4% compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") through 2023, according to industry research firms. By the end of 2023, it is estimated that the CM BPO industry will achieve a total market size of around $240 billion. Approximately 52% of the worldwide BPO spend comes from the Americas region, while Asia-Pacific region has the strongest growth (around 5% CAGR). Evolving buyer expectations to deliver next-generation CX will continue to fuel growth as brands increasingly turn to service providers to support their ongoing efforts for digital transformation.
 
The industry is also evolving to include key strategic elements beyond traditional contact centers and now includes CX consulting and digital CX services. Despite ongoing market consolidation through multiple mergers and acquisitions, this expanded scope of services driven by the digital CX needs of enterprises is likely to increase the market attractiveness for not only incumbent players but also for new providers with differentiated digital CX capabilities, according to industry research firm Everest Group.
 
Competition
 
The global contact center outsourcing market in which we operate is competitive. While many companies provide customer engagement solutions and services, we believe no one company is dominant in the industry. The industry continues to consolidate but remains very fragmented with the five largest competitors combined capturing less than 20% of the global market.
 
Our competitors vary by geography and business segment and range from large, multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly-focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation, integrated solutions, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, and financial strength. We primarily compete with in-house customer management operations as well as other companies that provide customer experience management, including Alorica, Concentrix, Sitel, Sykes, TTEC, Teleperformance, and Transcom, among others. We also compete with smaller, specialized companies and divisions of multinational companies such as Accenture, Conduent, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, among others.
 
Many of these competitors are significantly larger than us in revenue, income, number of contact centers and customer service agents, number of product offerings and market capitalization. We believe that while smaller than many of our competitors, we are able to compete because of our focus and scale as well as our ability to add value to our clients' businesses. Clients often select Startek to challenge these large competitors, seeking more innovation, flexibility and speed to market.
 
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws in the countries, states, and territories in which we operate, including tax, employment, environmental and other laws that govern the way we conduct our business. There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including significant changes in domestic government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and taxation with respect to foreign operations; unexpected changes in foreign government programs, policies, regulatory requirements and labor laws; and difficulties in staffing and effectively managing foreign operations.

Employees
 
We recognize our employees as the core of our success and provide them with learning opportunities, multicultural exposure, international work opportunities, and multiple career paths. As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 47,000 employees in 13 countries on five continents. Approximately 93% of our employees are located outside the United States. Approximately 8% of our employees were members of a labor union or were covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of which are mandated under national labor laws outside the United States. These agreements are subject to periodic renegotiations, and we anticipate that they will be renewed in the ordinary course of business without material impact to our business or in a manner materially different from other companies covered by such industry-wide agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
