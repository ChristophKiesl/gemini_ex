General Development and Narrative Description of Business 
 Retail Value Inc. is an Ohio corporation (the “Company” or “RVI”) formed in December 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, RVI did not conduct any business and did not have any material assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, RVI owned and operated a portfolio of 22 assets, composed of 11 continental United States assets and 11 assets in Puerto Rico.  As of December 31, 2020, these properties consisted of retail shopping centers (including five enclosed malls) composed of 8.5 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) located in nine states and Puerto Rico.  The Company’s continental U.S. assets comprised 48% and the properties in Puerto Rico comprised 52% of its total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.  RVI’s centers have a diverse tenant base that includes national retailers such as Walmart/Sam’s Club, Bed, Bath & Beyond, PetSmart, the TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods), Kohl’s, Best Buy and Gap.  Prior to July 1, 2018, RVI was a consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary of SITE Centers Corp. (“SITE Centers”) and was presented on a carve-out basis in accordance with the guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 The Company focuses on realizing value in its business through operations and sales of its assets, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for operating expenses, repayment of indebtedness and distributions to the Company’s preferred and common shareholders.  The Company is a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) that is externally managed and advised by one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries of SITE Centers (collectively with such wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Manager”), a self-administered and self-managed REIT in the business of acquiring, owning, developing, redeveloping, leasing and managing shopping centers and the Company’s parent prior to its spin-off into a separate, publicly traded company on July 1, 2018.  In February 2018, the Company and the Manager entered into three amended and restated management and leasing agreements for the provision of property management services for (a) properties held in the continental United States directly by the Company, (b) properties held in the continental United States by a taxable REIT subsidiary (a “TRS”) of the Company and (c) properties held in Puerto Rico (together, the “Property Management Agreements”).  In addition, on July 1, 2018, the Company and the Manager entered into a corporate management agreement (the “External Management Agreement” and, collectively with the Property Management Agreements, the “Management Agreements”) pursuant to which the Manager provides corporate management services to the Company.
 Recent Developments
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for information on certain recent developments of the Company, which is incorporated herein by reference to such information.  
COVID-19 Pandemic 
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and it continues to spread throughout the United States and other countries across the world.  Beginning in mid-March, federal, state and local governments took various actions to limit the spread of COVID-19, including ordering the temporary closure of non-essential businesses (which included many of the Company’s tenants) and imposing significant social distancing guidelines and restrictions on the continued operations of essential businesses and the reopening of non-essential businesses.As of March 4, 2021, approximately 98% of the Company’s tenants, based on average base rents, were open for business, up from a low of approximately 34% in early April 2020.  The COVID-19 pandemic had no impact on the Company’s collection of rents for the first quarter of 2020, but it had a significant impact on collection of rents for April 2020 through January 31, 2021.  The quarterly rent payment rates as of March 4, 2021, represented approximately 81% of second quarter 2020 rents, 90% of third quarter 2020 rents, 92% of fourth quarter 2020 rents and 95% of January 20201 rents.
 The Company calculates the aggregate percentage of rents paid for assets owned as of December 31, 2020, by comparing the amount of tenant payments received as of the date presented to the amount billed to tenants during the period, which billed amount includes abated rents, rents subject to deferral arrangements and rents owing from bankrupt tenants that were in possession of the space and billed.  For the purposes of reporting the percentage of aggregate base rents collected for a given period, when rents subject to deferral arrangements are later paid, those payments are allocated to the period in which the rent was originally owed.
 Although rent collection levels continued to improve through January 2021 relative to the second quarter of 2020, collection levels remain below historical averages and future rent collection may be negatively impacted by further surges in COVID-19 contagion in 2021 and any implementation of additional restrictions on tenant businesses as a result thereof.  The ultimate impact of

the pandemic and secondary social and economic effects on the Company's results of operations, financial position, liquidity and capital resources remains unclear and cannot be reasonably determined or forecasted at this time. For a further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part II of this Report on Form 10-K and “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financing Activities” and “Economic Conditions” included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this Report on Form 10-K.
 Retail Environment 
 Though leasing prospects are heavily dependent on local conditions, in general the Company continues to see demand from a broad range of tenants for its continental U.S. space, particularly as larger retailers incorporate omni-channel strategies that leverage brick and mortar infrastructure to drive incremental business. Value-oriented tenants continue to take market share from conventional and national chain department stores.  Some conventional department stores and national chains have announced bankruptcies, store closures and/or reduced expansion plans in recent years leading to a smaller overall number of tenants requiring large store formats. New demand for space at the Company’s Puerto Rico properties is more limited, especially with respect to big box and national tenants as many of those tenants continue to evaluate their presence and operating plans on the Island. The Company believes that occupancy, leasing spreads and collection rates within the Company’s Puerto Rico portfolio (especially its enclosed malls) are likely to continue to lag behind those at continental U.S. shopping centers in 2021 as a result of reduced leasing activity both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of curfews and greater operating restrictions in place in Puerto Rico for most of 2020 and early 2021.
 The Company’s tenant categories most significantly impacted by COVID-19 are theaters, entertainment and restaurants, which collectively account for approximately 18% of the Company’s annualized base rents.
 At December 31, 2020, the Company had 102 leases expiring in 2021 with an average base rent per square foot of $19.78.  The following table summarizes the portfolio’s leased rate and leasing spreads for the comparable leases executed for the periods presented, as well as the weighted-average cost of tenant improvements and lease costs:

---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The decrease in the leased rate in the continental U.S reflects the impact of asset dispositions, as well as a combination of anchor and store tenant expirations and tenant bankruptcies.  The increase in the occupancy rate for the Company’s Puerto Rico portfolio during 2020 primarily was due to the disposition of a property with a lower occupancy rate, as well new net leasing activity in excess of bankruptcies and expirations.  
 The Company’s leasing spread calculation includes only those deals that were executed within one year of the date the prior tenant vacated and, as a result, can be a good benchmark to compare the average annualized base rent of expiring leases with the comparable executed market rental rates. The continental U.S. new lease spreads of 27.4% were related to a comparable lease pool of only three leases as a result of lower leasing volume due to continued asset sales. The continental U.S. renewal spreads were slightly negative primarily due to two anchor tenant renewals executed in the first quarter at a property sold during 2020, which extended the term of both leases by 10 years.  Puerto Rico new lease spreads were primarily impacted by entering into new leases at lower rents with nominal capital expenditures.  The Company has a significant number of leases expiring in the near term and expects continued volatility and pressure on leasing spreads in both the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico as the Company prioritizes occupancy over rental rate growth.  In addition, the Company’s overall total reported leasing spreads could vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter 
 5


and year-to-year depending upon both the volume and size of leases executed in each period, particularly as the size of the portfolio decreases due to asset sales.  For more information, see “Risk Factors—The Company’s Dependence on Rental Income May Adversely Affect Its Ability to Meet Its Debt Obligations and Make Distributions to Shareholders.” 
 Competition 
 Numerous real estate companies and developers, private and public, compete with the Company for leasing space in shopping centers to tenants. The Company competes with other real estate companies and developers in terms of rental rate, property location, availability of other space and maintenance. 
Insurance 
 The Company has comprehensive liability, casualty, flood, terrorism and rental loss insurance policies on its properties. The Company believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, the Company’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover its losses. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” included in this section. 
Governmental Regulations 
 The Company’s business is subject to numerous governmental regulations, including regulations relating to the ownership of real estate, environmental law, regulations governing REITs and others. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” included in this section.
Compliance with Environmental Laws 
 As an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various federal, state, territorial and local laws, ordinances and regulations. See the detailed discussion of these and other risks related to environmental matters in “Risk Factors— The Company’s Real Estate Investments May Contain Environmental Risks That Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company met the qualification requirements of a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  As a result, the Company, with the exception of its TRS, will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it meets certain requirements of the Code.  
 The Company holds a number of properties indirectly through a TRS.  Income from operations and gains from the sale of property by a TRS are subject to tax at the TRS level at corporate tax rates.  The current U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations is 21%.
 Employees 
 The Company is managed by the Manager pursuant to the Management Agreements. All of the Company’s executive officers are employees of the Manager or its affiliates. The Company does not have any employees.

 The Company’s Manager
 The Company is externally managed and advised by the Manager pursuant to the Management Agreements. The Company does not have any employees. Instead, pursuant to the terms of the External Management Agreement, the Manager provides the Company 
 7


with its management team, including a chief executive officer, along with appropriate support personnel, in order to provide the management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company.  Accordingly, each of the Company’s executive officers is an executive of SITE Centers. 
 SITE Centers, however, is not obligated to dedicate any of its executives or other personnel exclusively to the Company. In addition, neither SITE Centers nor its executives or other personnel, including its executive officers supplied to the Company, are obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to the Company. The External Management Agreement requires only that members of the Company’s management team devote such time as is necessary and appropriate, commensurate with the level of the Company’s activity. Nevertheless, the Company believes it benefits from the personnel, relationships and experience of SITE Centers’ executive team. 
 The Management Agreements were negotiated between related parties, and although the Company believes the terms are reasonable and approximate terms of an arm’s-length transaction, their terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to the Company as if they had been negotiated at arm’s length with an unaffiliated third party. However, the Manager is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of the Board of Directors and has only such functions, responsibilities and authority as are specified in the Management Agreements. 
 For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company’s Relationship with SITE Centers and the Manager” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary—Manager” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
