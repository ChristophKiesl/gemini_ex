Item 1. Business
Overview
Pareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing)™.
Millions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum’s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum’s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (“IoT”), and telecommunications infrastructure providers.
With estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteum’s cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.
The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market-driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT&T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.
Pareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower “Every Person and Every(Thing)” to be globally connected, hence our slogan – ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE™. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggregators (“MVNO,” “MVNE” and “MVNA”), Smart Cities, and application developer markets, each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications Platform-as-a-Service (“CPaaS”), which Pareteum delivers.
Coronavirus Pandemic
In March 2020, COVID-19 began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States (“U.S.”) declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect our operating and financial results to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.
We have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.
Innovative Use Cases
Many sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Company’s platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others:
•Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.
•Connected cars
•Smart cities
•Smart logistics and supply chains
•Smart healthcare applications
In addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios (the “Acquired IP Rights”), which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.
Business Model
At Pareteum, our mission is to “Empower Communications Service Providers (“CSPs”), Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.” We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.
However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a “network effect.” The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.
To achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering mobility, engagement, intelligence and control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.
Go-to-Market and Growth Strategy
Pareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the 2018 and 2019 Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.
Pareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.
Our go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:

Phase 1: | Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs. 
Phase 2: | Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific). 
Phase 3: | Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more “things” (whether Subscriber Identification Module (“SIM”) cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.) to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market (including in developing markets).
Phase 4: | At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights. 

The phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the world’s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we’re successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.
We also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas:
•Exploring cross-sale and up-sale opportunities among Pareteum’s recent customer acquisitions – focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;
•Platform evolution – enhance and expand existing products and services; and
•Geographic expansion—focusing on entering new markets, such as South East Asia and Latin America.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 200 total employees worldwide, of which 199 were full-time employees. 
Research & Development
Pareteum’s research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Pareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking, and system and method for network curation, all expiring through 2034, and subject to renewals.
Pareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.
Sales and Marketing
Pareteum’s sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.
We engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product, and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.
Customers
Our customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.
A customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of hand-off from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom ("U.K."), Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Pareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24/7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteum’s customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.
The Company has significant customers and the loss of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two significant customers each individually accounted for 21% and 20% of our revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer accounted for 20% of our revenue.
Competition
We compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications’ platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.
We believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:
•the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;
•the price at which others offer competitive software and services;
•the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;
•the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;
•the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;
•the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and
•the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.
A number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.
The CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be:
•Scale and international reach of connectivity;
•Comprehensiveness of platform offerings;
•Ease of deployment and implementation; and
•Scalability and reliability of service.
Pareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes:
•MVNE services for CSPs: In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.
•Wi-Fi connectivity aggregation for enterprise customers: Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.
•Short Message Service Application-To-Person (“SMS A2P”) messaging for Enterprise customers: Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable business-to-consumer messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface (“API”) integration.
•IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers: Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.
Nevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.
One key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:
•Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.
•Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.
•Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.
•One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (“M2M”) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile (“GSM”) communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.
Regulatory
Pareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
Privacy and Data Protection
The regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
Because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Any failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments or policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions (especially the European Union ("EU")), enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.
Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we and our customers must comply, including but not limited to the EU, the U.K. and Switzerland. The EU and U.K. data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, U.K. and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of the EU, U.K. and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR (and its U.K. equivalent commonly referred to as the “U.K. GDPR”) regulates transfers of personal data (subject to such laws) from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the U.K. to the U.S. as well as other countries outside the EEA and the U.K. which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, U.K. and Switzerland to the U.S., creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the U.K. including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to U.S.-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects (for example, the “right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for EU and U.K. consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR’s and U.K. GDPR’s requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and U.K. data protection regulators under GDPR and U.K. GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.
On January 31, 2020, the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as “Brexit”. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EU’s trade agreements. Effective from January 1, 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the U.K. and the EU, as it existed before December 31, 2020, ended and the EU and the U.K. now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges (including data) that did not exist prior to December 31, 2020.
Even though the U.K. reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement ("TCA") and related documents, and the U.K. government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws (including the implementation of U.K. GDPR) that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from January 1, 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the U.K.’s new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the U.K. and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the U.K., the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.
Additionally, now that the U.K. and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the U.K. and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and/or operational implications for our business that involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.
Although the current arrangements between the EU and U.K. permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from January 1, 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether U.K. is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the U.K. not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws (and related guidance) between the U.K. and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the U.K. and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.
Non-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards for non-U.S. nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.
U.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.
Telecommunications Regulations
Currently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.

Financial Information About Segments
The Company has three operating segments, Legacy Pareteum, Artilium and iPass, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) manages segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions, and for which discrete financial information is available. The CODM assesses performance of the Company’s major lines of business, MVNO, MVNE, Messaging, and Enterprise (“Business Lines”), based on revenue, however the lowest level of discrete financial information, including revenue, cost of sales, gross margin and earnings, is at the primary business units, which represent the Company’s operating segments. The CODM makes resource allocation decisions, primarily regarding the number of employees allocated, based on revenue, gross margin, earnings and cash flows on a consolidated basis. The CODM is not provided and does not use asset information when making operating decisions, assessing performance, or allocating resources. For additional information regarding our reportable segment, see “Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Segment Reporting” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.
