General Development of Business
 
We are a natural resources development company committed to providing sustainable water and agricultural opportunities in California.
 
We own approximately 45,000 acres of land with high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources in three areas of Southern California’s Mojave Desert – the Cadiz Valley (35,000 acres), Danby Dry Lake (2,000 acres), and the Piute Valley (9,000 acres). Our properties represent a unique private reserve of lands with vested water rights located in a remote area of eastern San Bernardino County that is at the crossroads of major highway, rail, energy and water infrastructure that supply and deliver necessary resources to communities in California and across Western States (see Item 2, “Properties”, below).
 
Our properties were primarily assembled by our founders in the early 1980s, relying on NASA imagery that identified a unique desert land position at the base of a vast and topographically diverse Southern California watershed with potential for agricultural and water development.  The Cadiz Valley property (“Cadiz Property”) is underlain by extensive, high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater able to support a variety of uses (see “The Cadiz Water Project”, below).
 
Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of our land, water and related infrastructure assets in an environmentally responsible way. Our present activities are focused on developing our assets to meet growing long-term demand for access to sustainable water supplies and agricultural products.  California has systemic water challenges and is not able to ensure that all people in California can reliably access safe, clean drinking water. We believe that the highest and best use of our assets will be realized by offering a combination of water supply, water storage and agricultural projects in ways that are responsive to California’s resource needs.

Cadiz Inc.


The Cadiz Property is currently home to our primary development activities, including water supply and storage project development and active agricultural operations.
 
We have farmed at the Cadiz Property since the late 1980s relying on naturally recharging fresh groundwater supplies for irrigation. Today, our farming operations at the Cadiz Property (“Cadiz Ranch”) are the largest in San Bernardino County. At the Cadiz Ranch, we are engaged in sustainable agricultural production and through lease arrangements with partners have fruit, vegetable and grain crops in production (see “Sustainable Agriculture”, below).
 
In addition to our agricultural projects, we are focused on developing a water project that can help address California’s persistent systemic water challenges and deliver new water to California communities in need of reliable water supplies and water infrastructure.  Through management of groundwater at the Cadiz Property, the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (“Water Project”) would, in its first phase, conserve and supply new water for approximately 400,000 people in communities in Southern California (see “The Cadiz Water Project”, below). A second phase of the Water Project would bank and store imported water for use in future dry years. 
 
The Water Project has completed extensive permitting and environmental review in accordance with local, state and federal law and is approved to deliver a reliable supply of 50,000 acre-feet of water per year for 50 years to communities off of the Cadiz Property. Prior to construction and implementation, the Water Project must complete additional permitting primarily related to our conveyance of water supplies to contracting water agencies, as well as facility construction, improvements, and financing (see, “The Cadiz Water Project”, below).
 
Our commitment to delivering sustainable, long-term solutions to address California’s resource challenges is supported by our actions as a good steward of our land and water resources.  We follow a holistic land management strategy, employ a rigorous environmental policy, and engage with our stakeholders and those impacted by our projects to verify alignment and accountability.
 
More than 30,000 acres of our property are presently managed for conservation, including the reservation of 7,500 acres of our Piute property as a desert tortoise land conservation bank. Our Danby Property has suitability for water and agricultural projects but is also presently managed as permanent open space (see “Land Stewardship” and Item 2, “Properties”, below).
 
Our current working capital requirements relate largely to the support and operation of agricultural development, land management, and activities associated with the Water Project. Working capital requirements have been funded historically by debt and equity investments in our land, water and infrastructure.  Our agricultural operations provide our principal source of revenue, although our working capital needs are not fully supported by our lease and farming returns.  We believe that the ultimate implementation of the Water Project will provide a significant source of future cash flow for the business and our shareholders.
 
Our strategy for implementation of our projects, current status milestones and prospects are outlined in “Description of Business” below.

Description of Business
 
Our business is focused on the development of our land and water assets for their highest and best uses. 
 
Our properties and assets offer opportunities for a wide array of sustainable activities that could benefit those who lack reliable access to food, water and infrastructure.  At present, our development activities are focused on the Cadiz Water Project, sustainable agriculture, and land stewardship.
The Cadiz Water Project
 
Available water supply in Southern California is constrained every year by regulatory restrictions on each of the State’s three main water sources: (1) the Colorado River Aqueduct (“CRA”), which delivers water from the Colorado River into California; (2) the California State Water Project (“SWP”), which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state; and (3) the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to the City of Los Angeles.  Southern California’s water providers and farmers rely on imports from these systems to meet demand, but deliveries from all three into the region are consistently below capacity, even in wet years. 
 
Further, frequent swings between wet and dry years due to natural variability and climate change challenges California’s traditional supply system and drives a persistent demand for reliable storage and local supply.  Recent analysis from the State of California estimates that more than 1 million Californians lack reliable access to safe, clean drinking water and several communities are short of long-term reliable and affordable supply. 
 
To contribute solutions to California’s water challenges, we are focused on the development of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (“Water Project”), which we expect will provide the Company’s principal source of revenue once operational.
 
In the decade since we began permitting the Water Project, California’s water supply challenges have not abated.  Cyclical drought, climate change, and regulatory restrictions have created uncertainty for California’s long-term water supplies. The cost of water and infrastructure has also increased over the last decade making it more difficult for disadvantaged communities to access infrastructure necessary to provide reliable clean water supplies.  Our Water Project will offer a supplemental water supply that can help ensure that families, businesses and communities have access to safe, affordable water that is managed locally. The Water Project will also augment California’s existing banking and storage infrastructure to provide additional relief in future dry years.
 
The Water Project is a public-private partnership with California water agencies that is designed to, in its first phase (“Phase 1”) actively manage the aquifer system at the Cadiz Property to capture and conserve fresh, high-quality groundwater that is currently lost to high-salinity and evaporation and provide a new water supply for approximately 400,000 people in communities in Southern California.

Cadiz Inc.


Water Project operations will follow an extensive, state-of-the-art groundwater management plan (see, “Permits & Regulatory Approvals” below) and withdrawals of groundwater will be limited to sustainable amounts that preserve the health of the aquifer system and safeguard the desert ecosystem. Over the 50-year term of the Water Project, an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water per year will be captured and put to beneficial use in Southern California communities.  Phase 1 of the Water Project also offers participants the ability to carry-over their annual supply and hold it in storage in the groundwater basin from year to year. Approved “carryover storage” capacity is currently 150,000 acre-feet.
 
In a second phase of the Water Project (“Phase 2”), the Water Project would utilize the managed groundwater basin to offer storage in the aquifer system for an additional 850,000 acre-feet of fresh water that would be imported and held in storage until needed in future dry years. The total storage capacity of the aquifer system following implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Water Project is one million acre-feet.
 
The Water Project was designed on a foundation of scientific study to ensure the sustainability of operations. Several comprehensive studies of the water resources at the Cadiz Property and within the surrounding topographically diverse 1,300 sq. mile watershed have been completed to better understand the extent of the unique resources in the Cadiz Valley, including basin size, capacity, quality and geology.   
 
In summary, scientific research and study have demonstrated the following characteristics of the resource:
 

● | The aquifer underlying the Cadiz Property contains between 17 – 34 million acre-feet of groundwater in storage, a quantity on par with Lake Mead, the U.S.’s largest surface reservoir.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The aquifer system is composed of highly porous sands and rock allowing groundwater to easily flow. At the Cadiz Property, the groundwater table is reached at approximately 150 feet below ground surface, and fresh water extends over 1,000 feet below ground surface. Agricultural use of groundwater at the Cadiz Property has not resulted in any significant, sustained drawdown of the water table in the Cadiz Valley.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Groundwater enters the watershed as precipitation in the highest elevations and percolates downgradient to the Cadiz and Fenner Valleys and exits the system at large dry lake playas (Cadiz & Bristol Dry Lakes) south of the Cadiz Property. Natural recharge is estimated at approximately 32,500 acre-feet per year and physical measurements of evaporation from the dry lake playas are consistent with this recharge estimate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A combination of existing and new facilities will be required for implementation and operation of the Water Project.  Facilities include a wellfield, which would integrate the existing agricultural wells, a pipeline manifold system, and power facilities to support operation of the wellfield.  The Water Project may also include a water treatment facility to meet water quality requirements of our partner agencies.  Further, to deliver water to participants in the Water Project, a water conveyance pipeline would be required either via new construction or conversion of existing pipeline facilities in the area.  We currently contemplate the use of two pipeline routes for the Water Project; one to extend southwards from the Cadiz Property to the Colorado River Aqueduct in Rice, California (the “Southern Pipeline”) and the other to extend northwards from the Cadiz Property to Wheeler Ridge, California (the “Northern Pipeline”).

Construction of the Water Project facilities that would allow for conservation, carry-over storage and delivery of groundwater to public water providers is expected to cost approximately $400 million and will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by a combination of definitive purchase and sale agreements with Water Project participants and the new facility assets.
 
We have received substantially all permits required to construct a wellfield, pipeline and related facilities at the Cadiz Property as part of Phase 1 of the Water Project (see “Permits & Regulatory Approvals”, below).
 
Prior to construction and implementation of the Water Project, we require final contracts (see “Contracts with Agencies”, below), conveyance arrangements to move water between the Cadiz Property and the service areas of participating water agencies (see “Conveyance Pipelines”, below), which are also subject to regulatory approval, and final design, procurement and construction. The status of each development phase is described below.
 
Permits & Regulatory Approvals
 
To ensure the safety and sustainability of the Water Project operations, the Water Project requires environmental and regulatory permits prior to construction and implementation.  Following a multi-year permitting process, the Water Project received permits that allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years, on average 50,000 acre-feet per year, in accordance with the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County. 
 
The Water Project has completed a California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) review process including the completion of a comprehensive Final Environmental Impact Report (“FEIR”). The FEIR concluded that Water Project operations would not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts.  The FEIR was certified on July 31, 2012.
 
San Bernardino County, the local agency responsible for groundwater use at the Cadiz Property has also reviewed the Water Project and approved its Groundwater Monitoring, Management and Mitigation Plan (‘GMMMP”), which establishes a monitoring network to ensure that the Water Project will not cause harm to the environment or surrounding land uses. The GMMMP includes 100 monitoring features across the watershed and regular transparent disclosure of conditions.  The FEIR and GMMMP permits allow the conservation and delivery of 50,000 acre-feet of groundwater per year for 50 years to serve beneficial uses in California communities. These permits were upheld and sustained in their entirety by judgements in California courts and are no longer subject to legal challenge.
 
In August 2019, an Addendum to the FEIR was adopted by the Fenner Valley Water Authority, a joint powers authority comprised of the public water agencies participating in the Water Project, to address updates to the Water Project proposal, such as its water treatment program and pipeline route. The Addendum also assessed new studies published on natural springs in the Water Project watershed.  The Addendum concluded that there are no significant adverse impacts associated with the minor changes to the Water Project and further summarized that the spring studies did not change the conclusions of the FEIR’s analysis. The Addendum was not challenged in court and is no longer subject to litigation.

Phase 2 of the Water Project has been the subject of programmatic environmental review in accordance with CEQA, but still requires project-level environmental review and permitting. Phase 2 may also require additional local or federal permits that have not yet been identified.
Contracts with Water Agencies
 
The Water Project is a public-private partnership with public agencies in Southern California.
 
We have executed Letters of Intent (“LOIs”), option agreements and purchase agreements, or contracts with public water agencies and private water utilities in California.  These participating agencies serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California’s San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties.
 
We have pledged to ensure the benefits of the Water Project are realized locally in San Bernardino County, where the Cadiz Property is located. Twenty percent of Water Project supplies have been reserved for San Bernardino County-based agencies. We have also pledged to dedicate water supplies from the Water Project to disadvantaged communities (“DAC” or “DACs”) that traditionally have been underserviced or out of reach of established water providers.  All current partners in the Water Project contain at least one community classified as a DAC.
 
The Santa Margarita Water District (“SMWD”) was the first public agency to approve a final Water Purchase and Sale Agreement in 2012 for an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water for 50 years.  The structure of the SMWD purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment, plus a pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs.  The capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the Company over a 30-year term.
 
Option agreements executed from 2010 – 2011, prior to the CEQA process, provide to participants the right to acquire an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water at a $775 per acre-foot (2010 dollars, subject to adjustment), which is competitive with the incremental cost of new water.  In addition, these agencies received options to acquire storage rights in the Water Project to allow for the management of their Water Project supplies in complement with their own water resources.  Up to 150,000 acre-feet of carry-over storage is available for reservation by the agencies prior to construction commencement.  Participants that elect to achieve year-to-year flexibility in their use of Water Project water by utilizing carry-over storage will reserve storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.
 
LOIs that have been entered into since completion of the CEQA process provide participants the right to acquire supplies from the Water Project at $960 per acre-foot (2014 dollars, subject to adjustment).  These LOIs also include the option to reserve carry-over storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.

Cadiz Inc.


Water supply and storage pricing in final agreements will reflect adjustments in market pricing that have occurred since initial execution of option agreements. We believe the cost of water supply and storage from the Water Project to be among the most cost-effective options in Southern California.
 
In 2020, we continued efforts with Water Project public agency participants to convert option agreements to definitive contracts. Generally, contracts are subject to the approval of the elected boards of the participants and subject to environmental review and compliance with CEQA.  Participants can complete additional study and investigation of the Water Project prior to consideration of a contract.  In 2020, we supported efforts of our public agency participants to conduct their discretionary review of the Water Project and its existing permits as they further evaluate a definitive contract in the Water Project.  
 
Conveyance Pipelines
 
We anticipate using two separate pipeline routes to convey water from the Cadiz Property to the service areas of our participating agencies.   The first route, or the Southern Pipeline, requires the construction of a 43-mile water conveyance pipeline within a portion of the Arizona & California Railroad Company (“ARZC”) right-of-way that crosses the Cadiz Property and intersects with the CRA in Rice, California.  The CRA is owned by the Metropolitan Water District (“MWD”) and serves water providers in six southern California counties.  The second route, or the Northern Pipeline, contemplates the use of an existing 30” natural gas pipeline that we optioned and acquired from El Paso Natural Gas (“EPNG”) as a potential facility to convey water to the Cadiz Property for storage, or from the Cadiz Property to parties along the route. The Northern Pipeline extends 220-miles from the Cadiz Property to Wheeler Ridge, California and crosses the Mojave River Pipeline, the Los Angeles Aqueduct and terminates near the State Water Project.
 
The use of either route for conveyance of water to or from the Cadiz Property is subject to additional regulatory approval as outlined below.
 

a. | Southern Pipeline
---+------------------

 
The Southern Pipeline will be a 55-85” steel pipeline that would be constructed within the Arizona & California Railroad Company (“ARZC”) 200 ft. wide right-of-way from the Cadiz Property south-east to the CRA near Rice, California.  In 2008, we entered into a 99-year lease agreement with the ARZC to utilize a portion of its existing right-of-way for a conveyance pipeline and related facilities. As part of the lease arrangement, we agreed to provide necessary railroad improvements in furtherance of railroad purposes. This includes providing water and power to the railroad for fire protection and improving access roads and transloading operations, among other things.  By co-locating the conveyance pipeline within this existing railroad right-of-way, Water Project construction would avoid impacts to desert habitats. The route and construction within the route were evaluated and approved during the Water Project’s CEQA process. 
 
Our proposed co-location in the right-of-way was evaluated and approved as part of the CEQA process, and was also separately assessed by the US Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) to determine the need for any federal permitting related to the proposed use of the ARZC right-of-way, which was originally granted to the railroad by the federal government.  BLM’s evaluation, which was issued in February 2020, concluded that the proposed pipeline will further railroad purposes at least in part, is within the scope of the right-of-way, and requires no additional BLM approvals.

Construction of the Southern Pipeline and related facilities will not be initiated until we complete the following additional regulatory approvals:
 

(i.) | an agreement with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to move Water Project water supplies in the CRA;
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii.) | a finding by the California State Lands Commission that conveying water from the Water Project in the CRA will not adversely affect the desert environment.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | MWD Agreement
---+--------------

 
Water supplies conserved by the Water Project would enter the CRA at the termination of the Southern Pipeline. The CEQA process considered a variety of options for the interconnection to the CRA and conveyance of Water Project supplies in the CRA to the service area of participating water agencies.  Final terms and conditions for entry and conveyance will be determined by MWD in consultation with the Water Project’s participating agencies.
 
MWD is required to convey water for a third party subject to provisions in California Water Code sections 1810 – 1815, Joint Use of Capacity in Water Conveyance Facilities (also known as “the Wheeling Statutes”) provided that supplies entering the CRA comply with MWD’s published engineering, design and water quality standards.  Water supplies conveyed in the CRA are also subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by MWD for the conveyance of water within its service territory.  Any wheeling fees will be payable by participants in the Water Project. 
 
Adding Cadiz groundwater to the CRA offers a water quality benefit to MWD and its member agencies that may also be considered when establishing terms and conditions for entry and conveyance in the CRA. Cadiz water presently meets all state and federal water quality requirements without treatment and total dissolved solids (“TDS”) or salts in the Cadiz water supply are substantially lower than the water in the CRA. Adding Cadiz water to the CRA could lower its TDS and provide a reduction in treatment costs.  Some naturally occurring constituents at Cadiz are lower than state and federal drinking water standards, but potentially higher than the water in the CRA; however, based on extensive pilot testing, they can be lowered via treatment to ambient levels or removed entirely with use of cost-effective treatment technologies.
 
We believe there are multiple benefits that can be realized by MWD and water users throughout its service area upon making space reasonably available for Cadiz water supplies and providing the region the flexibility of relying on the Water Project in both wet and dry years. 
 
Once agreement regarding terms and conditions of the Water Project’s use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies is reached, then the agreement will be considered by the MWD Board. We expect a formal application to MWD for consideration of terms and conditions would be filed following completion of our contractual arrangements.

ii. | State Lands Commission Review under Water Code Section 1815
----+------------------------------------------------------------

 
Water Code Section 1815, which is a component of California’s “Wheeling Statutes” referenced above, requires desert groundwater projects to apply for a review by the California State Lands Commission (“SLC”) prior to moving water in facilities like the CRA.  This review must determine whether such projects would have “unreasonable effects on the environment and water dependent ecosystems in the surrounding watersheds.” The review by SLC must be conducted within 15 months of any filed application, with an option to extend for an additional 9 months upon public notice and explanation.  Any application to the SLC for review of the Water Project’s plans to convey water in the CRA from the Cadiz Property will be accompanied by evidence of the Water Project’s extensive record of environmental sustainability as well as data and reports that we expect will withstand critical scrutiny. We do not expect a formal application with the SLC will be filed until Water Project contracts are finalized. 
 

b. | Northern Pipeline
---+------------------

 
The Northern Pipeline is a 220-mile long, 30-inch-wide existing idle steel pipeline that extends northwest from our Cadiz Property and crosses agricultural, military, industrial and exurban communities across San Bernardino, Los Angeles, and Kern counties.  The pipeline also crosses primary state water infrastructure including the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the State Water Project.  
 
Technical engineering studies have indicated that the pipeline (a former petroleum products line that was retired in 2005) could transport between 18,000 and 30,000 acre-feet of water per year between points along the pipeline corridor. Professional water quality and structural testing of a five-mile segment conducted in 2020 determined that there were no residual gas or petroleum products in the tested segment and that the pipeline is structurally sound to transport water.
 
We completed the acquisition from El Paso Natural Gas Company (“EPNG”) of the first 96-mile segment of the Northern Pipeline from Cadiz to Barstow, California in 2014. Our right to acquire the remaining 124-mile segment from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge, California was subject to certain conditions precedent, described below, including the securing of rights to operate the Northern Pipeline for water conveyance. 
 
In December 2020, BLM granted to our subsidiary Cadiz Real Estate LLC two right-of-way permits that now enable us to transport water through the entire Northern Pipeline over BLM-managed lands. The first right-of-way was issued pursuant to an assignment in October 2020 of a portion of an existing right-of-way held by EPNG and renewed by BLM under the Mineral Leasing Act that enables the continued transportation of natural gas. The second right-of-way was issued under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and authorizes the conveyance of water in the pipeline over BLM-managed lands.
 
With these BLM grants, the conditions precedent were principally satisfied allowing for completion of the Company’s acquisition of the remaining 124-mile segment of the Northern Pipeline upon final payment to EPNG of $19 million, which is required to be made no later than June 30, 2021.

Cadiz Inc.


The Northern Pipeline offers California water purveyors a unique asset and corresponding opportunity to connect available supplies with rural areas of the State that are underserved. If the Northern Pipeline were to become operational for water conveyance, then the Water Project would interconnect Southern California’s primary water delivery systems for the first time, enabling more flexible trading among participants on these systems.  We are presently engaged in discussions with parties interested in using the Northern Pipeline for conveyance, storage and supply.   
 
Prior to conveyance of water through the Northern Pipeline, we must secure permits required by any definitive agreement to use the facility.  All conveyance of water via the Northern Pipeline would be conducted in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws.
 
The cost to make the entire Northern Pipeline operational for delivery of water is estimated at approximately $100 million and will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by any contracts to use the pipeline, as well as the facility assets.
 
Facility Design & Construction
 
Prior to final construction of the Water Project facilities, we must finalize facility design and acquire relevant construction permits from local agencies.
 
Together with SMWD we have engaged engineering and environmental consultants to complete design plans for remaining necessary facilities. This work is ongoing and expected to proceed in coordination with the negotiation of contracts and conveyance arrangements.  We have not yet completed a bidding or Request for Proposal process for Water Project construction.  
Social Impact
 
Upon implementation, the Water Project’s safe and sustainable operations will benefit community stakeholders.  The Water Project will have the following positive social impacts:
 

● | Water for disadvantaged communities. All public agency participants with options to contract for water from the Water Project contain at least one disadvantaged community within their service area. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve local water quality. The introduction of our low TDS groundwater in the CRA, which is known to be high in TDS, would provide a water softening benefit that would reduce treatment costs for MWD and its member agencies. Water Project partners have also established a $5 million fund for small water systems in disadvantaged communities to support their local water quality improvements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Repurposing carbon contributing assets. The use of the Northern Pipeline for water conveyance will convert a former oil and gas pipeline for the beneficial use of water conveyance. The recycling of an existing pipeline will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the load on the state’s current water transportation sources.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cadiz Inc.



● | Creation of new renewable energy. The Cadiz Southern Pipeline and Northern Pipelines will feature in-line turbines that will generate renewable hydropower. The Water Project wells and pump stations will be powered at least in part by solar energy and natural gas. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Protection of habitats. All Water Project facilities will be built on private lands, disturbed public lands or within existing transportation corridors which will avoid any impacts on habitats. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support stable water rates. The addition of new reliable supply, groundwater storage, improved water quality and system efficiency will allow water agency participants to keep rates low in their service area.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Create and support good-paying jobs. The Water Project is expected to create and support nearly 6,000 jobs across the local economy during two phases of construction; 10% of jobs are reserved for veterans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improved tax base. The Water Project will contribute new tax revenue to local governments, including County budgets and local schools in disadvantaged communities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sustainable Agricultural Development
 
Farming began at the Cadiz Property in the 1980s and has continued sustainably since that time. Our entire 35,000-acre Cadiz Property is zoned to allow for agricultural development.  A total of 9,600 acres of the property, which is also known as the Cadiz Ranch, has been permitted for agricultural use, allowing for planting, irrigation and related infrastructure. The Cadiz Ranch is the largest approved agricultural operation in San Bernardino County.
 
The property features worker housing and commissary for 300 people, as well as office and equipment facilities. Irrigation is supported by 9 wells, with capacity to deliver up to 25,000 acre-feet of water per year. All agricultural wells are expected to be integrated into any Water Project wellfield.  Water quality is excellent with very low TDS and meets all state and federal requirements without treatment.
 
Presently 3,342 acres are developed for farming via a combination of lease arrangements and direct farming by Cadiz as follows:
 

● | 2,100 acres have been leased for the farming of lemons and other crops, 640 acres of which have been planted as lemons to date. All farming expenses are borne by the lessees. Revenues received from these leases totals approximately $420,000 per year. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 242 acres have been leased for the farming of industrial hemp by SoCal Hemp JV LLC, our 50/50 joint venture partnership with Glass House Farms. The farming of hemp was federally legalized in the 2018 US Farm Bill. In 2020, all the leased acreage was planted to eight varieties of industrial hemp. All farming expenses are borne by the joint venture. Revenues received from the SoCal Hemp lease total $121,000 per year. SoCal Hemp is still conducting research and development on the application in consumer products of the cannabinol (CBD) and other cannabinoids derived from the harvested hemp. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cadiz Inc.



● | An additional 1,000 acres has been prepared for the farming grain crops, but it is presently fallow. We expect to plant this acreage in 2021. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To address climate change, maintain a natural environment and support habitat for local flora and fauna, we and our farming partners follow best practices that minimize water use, improve soil fertility, and reduce pesticides and other applications that could adversely impact soil, water or food quality. 
 
All farming at the Cadiz Ranch is conducted in accordance with permits from San Bernardino County. We report our crop mix, groundwater use, water quality, well levels, and other trends annually to the County. 
 
Efficient use of water by agriculture is critical to long-term sustainability and our agricultural operations. In 2019, the Cadiz/Fenner groundwater basins, which underlie our farming operations, were classified as “low/very low” priority in accordance with the California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (“SGMA”) demonstrating the sustainability of the groundwater basins that support our ongoing irrigation.  By contrast, the Public Policy Institute of California has estimated that between 535,000 and 750,000 acres of farmland in the Central Valley will have to be permanently fallowed in order for these groundwater basins to satisfy SGMA. Given the enduring safety and sustainability of our agricultural operations, we anticipate offering a continuing option for agricultural operations in California.
 
All Cadiz Ranch agriculture is developed to be compatible with anticipated Water Project operations. Overlying farming demands will be coordinated with Water Project operations and existing permits to utilize available water for its highest and best use.
 
Land Stewardship
 
Our mission includes managing our desert properties for their highest and best use. Approximately 30,000 acres of our total 45,000 acres are presently managed for permanent open space.
 
In 2014, we permanently dedicated approximately 7,500 acres of our Piute Valley properties to conservation.  These properties, which are not associated with the Cadiz Water Project or Cadiz Agricultural operations, are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas. In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank (“Fenner Bank”), a land conservation bank that makes available these properties for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by any development across the Southern California desert. Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development. For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development projects being considered throughout the Mojave Desert. Credits sold by the Fenner Bank are dedicated to funding the permanent preservation of the land by the San Diego Habitat Conservancy and research by San Diego Zoo Global into desert tortoise health and species protection. Any future revenues received from credits sold are expected to be reinvested into the land conservation operation.

Other Opportunities
 
We remain committed to the sustainable use of our land, water and infrastructure assets and will continue to explore all opportunities for sustainable development in an environmentally responsible way. We cannot estimate which of these opportunities will ultimately be realized.
Seasonality
 
Our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature.
 
Farming operations on the leased land at the Cadiz Property include the year-round cultivation of lemons and spring and fall plantings of vegetables and grains.  These operations have been subject to general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry.
Competition
 
We face competition in the acquisition, development and sale of water and land assets from a variety of parties. We also experience competition in our development of water projects and agriculture associated with our properties. Since California has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water, we believe that location, price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in California. We believe our projects are competitive with other sources of water and agriculture.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 10 full-time employees (i.e. those individuals working more than 1,000 hours per year).  Our business operations also rely on seasonal and temporary workers, as well as non-employee consultants and vendors to help augment specialized human capital and talent needs.  Our full-time, seasonal, and temporary employees as well as non-employee consultant and vendors must follow our code of conduct and ethics policy, as well as our whistleblower and information security policies. 
 
We appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. The average tenure of our full-time employees is more than 10 years, reflecting our positive work environment that offers opportunities to develop new skills and advance to new positions. We believe we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages to our employees, including a 401(k) plan. Further, we urge professional development opportunities and mentorship to cultivate talent throughout the Company.
 
As a small workforce, we focus on skill sharing and experience diversity in the workplace.  Our full-time employees have opportunity to often work with senior leadership and/or Board members in pursuit of business objectives. Management and leadership provide annual reviews of employee performance. Human capital is generally managed by our CEO and CFO, and employment policies are overseen by the Board, particularly the Compensation Committee.

We are focused on both executing on a strategy to support progress and evaluating our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities to ensure our workforce reflects the communities in which we operate. 
 
COVID-19
 
We have remained open throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as a member of the agricultural products industry. Our employees were provided opportunities to telework and flexibility to manage the unique demands of the situation. We expect to continue to support work-from-home arrangements for our employees even as the pandemic eases in the months ahead as it has created new flexibility that is favored by our workforce.  
 
Our employees in the office and temporary and seasonal workers in the field are provided socially-distanced working spaces and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  Our operations are in compliance with all local, state and federal pandemic regulations. 
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local laws and regulations, as detailed throughout Item 1.  As we proceed with the development of our properties, including the Water Project, we will be required to demonstrate to various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws, regulations and policies enforced by such authorities.  Groundwater development, and the export of conserved groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies, is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes pertaining to water supply, but also general environmental statutes applicable to all forms of development. Agricultural operations are generally subject to regulation by local agencies, such as county governments, as well as state environmental and water statutes. For example, we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to assessment of environmental impact, particularly given the location of our assets in the California desert and in proximity to public lands. Because of the discretionary nature of these approvals, concerns raised by governmental officials, public interest groups and/or other interested parties during both the development and the approval process may impact our ability to develop our properties in the manner we believe would fulfill their highest and best use. The realization of income from our projects, including the Water Project, could be delayed, reduced or eliminated based on regulatory restrictions and/or processes.
