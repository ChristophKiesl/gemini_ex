ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our mission is to empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives. Livongo is pioneering a new category in healthcare, called Applied Health Signals, which is transforming the management of chronic conditions. We have created a unified platform that provides smart, cellular-connected devices, supplies, informed coaching, and data science-enabled insights and facilitates access to medications across multiple chronic conditions to help our members lead better lives. We currently offer Livongo for Diabetes, Livongo for Hypertension, Livongo for Prediabetes and Weight Management, and Livongo for Behavioral Health by myStrength. We create consumer-first experiences with high member satisfaction, measurable, sustainable health outcomes, and more cost-effective care for our members and our clients. This approach is leading to better clinical and financial outcomes while also creating a better experience for people with chronic conditions and their care team of family, friends, and medical professionals. 
Our platform, which leverages data science and technology, creates a new kind of personalized experience for people with chronic conditions (our members). This empowers our members to make sustainable behavior changes that lead to better outcomes and lower costs. The Livongo experience makes it easier for them to stay healthy. We fit into the way they live, put them in control of managing their condition, and give them an experience that they don’t just like, but love (evidenced by our average Livongo for Diabetes member Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of +64 as of December 31, 2019). 
Our Offerings
We offer an integrated suite of solutions to promote sustainable health behavior change based on easy, real-time data capture supported by intuitive devices; insights driven by data science; and a human touch when the member needs it. Our suite of solutions shares a common product architecture and data structure, and is delivered through a common user interface, multi-channel applications for management, and a cross-condition integrated coaching model. Each solution can be used alone or in conjunction with others and enables members to share results with family, friends, or healthcare providers.
We currently offer the following solutions:

• | Livongo for Diabetes: We serve members with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This solution offers our members a cellular-connected interactive blood glucose meter, unlimited blood glucose test strips, personalized messages to support behavior change, which we call Health Nudges, digital tools across mobile, web, and email, as well as coaching and monitoring. Additionally, we offer 24x7x365 monitoring, whereby members who have dangerously low or high blood glucose receive a call from one of our in-house Certified Diabetes Educators, or CDEs, within a few minutes, no matter where they are in the world. In 2019, we announced a partnership with Amazon to leverage a HIPAA-compliant Amazon Alexa to power a voice-enabled cellular blood glucose monitoring system, allowing members to easily interact with us via the most natural and personalized communication channel - their voice. 


• | Livongo for Hypertension: Members receive a connected blood pressure monitor and cuff which is wireless and transmits data after each measurement to our mobile app. We recently introduced a cellular-connected blood pressure monitor and cuff as well. Members are able to review results, get Health Nudges for managing their blood pressure by reminding them to take their medication, follow a healthy eating pattern, be more physically active, and receive coaching and monitoring. Members have access to the same digital toolkit and expert coaching that’s available to them through Livongo for Diabetes. 


• | Livongo for Prediabetes and Weight Management: Members who are at risk for developing diabetes or are overweight are offered a combination of a cellular-connected weight scale, a rich mobile experience that includes health education curricula and content, personalized coaching by registered dieticians and exercise physiologists, Health Nudges, group classes, and online communities to encourage healthy eating and exercise habits. We acquired the technology underlying this solution in 2018. 


• | Livongo for Behavioral Health by myStrength: This solution uses a digital-first approach to delivering evidence-based interventions including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, positive psychology, mindfulness, and motivational interviewing to help resolve clinical conditions, build resiliency, manage stress, improve

mood, sleep better, or simply find daily inspiration. In February 2019, we acquired myStrength and are in the process of integrating the myStrength solution into our solution suite.
Our Engine - AI+AI
Our multidisciplinary team has built a flexible and robust technology engine capable of processing data from our devices as well as other data sources and turning that information into valuable Health Signals. At the heart of our platform is a core set of four capabilities which we call AI+AI: Aggregate, Interpret, Apply, and Iterate.

• | Aggregate: We aggregate data and information from a variety of sources. Inputs come from our devices (i.e. blood pressure information from our smart, connected blood pressure cuff), human interactions with our coaches, member preference data, traditional data stores (like medical and pharmacy claims) as well as data from a diverse set of partners (for example, nutritional data and activity tracker inputs). 


• | Interpret: To interpret the aggregated data, a set of critical steps occur that are driven by our unique team of data scientists, behavior specialists, and clinicians. We parse this data to determine the most important signals to feed into our AI+AI engine, extracting signals from the data we have aggregated and normalizing the signals to make them usable. They include: 


• | Dimensionalizing the signals to ascertain which ones are the most meaningful for a specific use and combining individual signals into Health Signals.


• | Mapping Health Signals into what we already know about the people we are serving to deliver more impact.


• | Interpreting the full range of signal-to-application possibilities through the lens of a set of clinical requirements and protocols to determine the right applications to deliver specific, timely health recommendations for a specific person.


• | Building the most relevant healthcare messages and outputs to be delivered as well as mapping the personalized messages that will work for the specific individual members. This can include things like feedback from a member’s blood glucose meter, live coaching via text or phone call, or coaching and monitoring team connections when needed. 


• | Apply: We deliver specific Health Nudges directly to our members, based on each member’s chronic condition and specific needs at exactly the right time in the right format and context. This process is the broad set of ways (modalities) that Health Signals get applied to certain individuals for a specific action and/or behavior support. This set of technologies includes our device applications (including our blood glucose meter, blood pressure cuff, and weight scales), human applications (live coaching and warm transfers to pharmacists, care teams or providers) and web/text based modalities. 


• | Iterate: Iterate describes the way that we bring Health Signals back into our AI+AI engine from the channels described in Apply. We iterate and continuously tailor a member’s experience based on his or her behavior, preferences, feedback, and results, in much the same way Netflix makes entertainment recommendations based on your preferences. Our Iterate capability is unique in three key ways: 


• | Contextual Iteration: This describes our ability to identify and use the right type of data science “tool” (such as A/B testing, reinforcement learning, Bayesian approaches, neural networks, or other essential tools) for the right type of Health Signal we are iterating back into our AI+AI engine.


• | Real-time Iteration: We iterate in real-time as members and other parts of the healthcare ecosystem are using the channels described in Apply.


• | Multifaceted Iteration: We are iterating based on multiple facets of the experience people have with our AI+AI engine, including the type of message or Health Nudge to which they are responding, the day and time they are responding, and the specific offerings (e.g., waived medication co-payments or nutrition support) that are most useful in improving an individual’s health.

The more our members use one of our solutions, the more data they generate for our engine, which allows our feedback loop to grow more powerful for all members. In addition, we aggregate dozens of other data sets and combine them, so that we can go 
Index to Financial Statements

on to interpret and extract the drivers of behavior change on a personal member-by-member level, just like an Amazon or Netflix experience, and use that information to deliver a more personalized experience. As the number of members using our solutions and sources of data we collect and aggregate on our platform have grown, the number of data points feeding into our engine has rapidly expanded. This data is a powerful input for our AI+AI engine and as it grows we believe it will improve performance of our solutions, including coaching and Health Nudges, and enrollment rates.
Our AI+AI engine is designed to continuously optimize the member experience. Just as importantly, the learnings from a particular member’s AI+AI loop can help inform how to improve another member’s experience. This allows the engine to grow more powerful, smart and efficient over time for all Livongo members.
We are increasingly using our AI+AI engine to create a competitive advantage in the following ways:

• | Optimizing Enrollment: We leverage our AI+AI engine for the enrollment process to ensure rapid onboarding of new clients and efficient enrollment of new members. Individuals receive a mix of email, direct mailer, and company communications depending on the enrollment method selected by their employer explaining our offerings and instructions on how to enroll. We tailor the form of communication and messaging used based on information we learn and test through our AI+AI engine. 


• | Welcome Kit and Onboarding: Each new member then receives a Welcome Kit. We iterate on aspects such as packaging design, unboxing experience, quick start instructions, and member support in order to minimize the time to first use. In the case of a member with diabetes, this kit includes an already-charged, already-personalized, cellular and wirelessly updateable blood glucose meter, a charger, test strips, a lancing device, lancets, and a “getting started guide” for our solution. Everything, including the devices and unlimited testing supplies, is sent cost free to the member. Livongo measures key performance indicators associated with onboarding including the time from Welcome Kit receipt to first device usage. 


• | Personalized Feedback and Health Nudges: Once a member starts using our hypertension and/or diabetes offering, he or she immediately gains access to the Applied Health Signals (personalized feedback, Health Nudges and digital tools) that are driven by our AI+AI engine. For example, if we identify that a member has not been checking their blood glucose in the mornings, we can send a Health Nudge that encourages the member to check before breakfast in order to better understand overnight patterns. We provide this feedback through the member’s optimal communication channel, which could be the blood glucose meter, mobile app, web, digital voice, phone, email, or text message. 


• | Remote Monitoring and Coaching: This includes live rapid 24x7x365 response calls, personalized coaching, and warm transfers to appropriate care teams where needed, including connecting members to their pharmacists to seek medication optimization. Our remote monitoring serves as a safety net for our members. We closely track the categories of inquiries, the guidance provided, and the clinical impact of the coaching that is delivered. This information is fed back to our AI+AI engine in order to enhance our digital coaching tools, as well as to optimize the deployment of our expert coaches. 

Other digital condition management programs are often focused on one or two conditions, providing a set of condition-specific applications and iterating the use of those applications. They often lack the in-depth data science capabilities to contextually iterate using the most appropriate data science methods to improve health. In contrast, our AI+AI engine is purpose-built to quickly develop core knowledge of each member and is designed for multi-condition use. That design element enables rapid scaling of impact for the member as we add new conditions to our platform. For example, the specific medical recommendations for applications and Health Signals to enable healthy behavior are obviously different for diabetes, hypertension, and prediabetes and weight management, but the signals about which person is receptive to what type of a message over which specific device, the optimal time of day to reach a specific person, and even what type of personality they prefer in a live coaching session, are Health Signals that hold true across conditions.
We have intentionally constructed our AI+AI engine so we can scale to an unlimited number of chronic conditions and applications with an eye to consistent simplification of the healthcare experience for people with multiple chronic conditions. In simple terms, we look at ways to make the Livongo experiences seamless for multi-condition members by unifying devices, coaching, Health Signals, guidance, and enrollment when and where possible.
We are actively developing an Applied Health Signals marketplace in which we support and offer third-party applications so we can ensure each member has the specific applications most useful for them. We will also continue developing an open marketplace to allow third-party partners like digital medication management, outside coaching solutions, and devices, such as 
Index to Financial Statements

Apple Watch, smartphone, Siri, and smart speakers, to be connected to our solutions in a highly secured manner. As we continue to develop and enhance Applied Health Signals partnerships, we will continuously aggregate new data into our AI+AI engine from partner devices (for example, continuous blood glucose monitoring data) and partner application programming interface (for example, nutritional data and activity tracker inputs).
We achieved over 99.9% uptime for our members during the year ended December 31, 2019. Systems are continually monitored for any signs of problems and preemptive action is taken when necessary. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to a redundant server storage device in a secondary data center. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems and advanced fire and flood prevention.
Our whole person approach to providing care is not just reflected in breadth of conditions managed, but in the integration of care across multiple conditions through multiple modalities into one unified experience. All member data is aggregated in the Livongo cloud. Members can see and track progress across all their conditions in our mobile app. Key information for each condition is summarized, while reminders, challenges, and lessons are prioritized for display when needed. For example, when a member with diabetes checks his or her blood glucose via a Livongo connected blood glucose meter, the member receives a Health Nudge that empowers that member to manage their condition right at the time of natural engagement. Consistent with caring for the whole person, we also deploy a variety of behavior change interventions in areas such as activity tracking and nutrition challenges to improve members’ overall health. These intervention areas, while not always unique to a given condition such as diabetes or hypertension, are often closely linked to them, so small incremental improvements in these areas can drive meaningful outcomes. And, our coaching team has a full view of all of the member clinical and behavior data required in order to provide highly personalized cross-condition coaching support.
How We Plan to Empower More Lives

• | Increase Member Enrollment within Existing Clients (Product Intensity). At the end of twelve months, our average enrollment rate for Livongo for Diabetes clients who launched enrollment in January 2019 is approximately 35% of the total recruitable individuals at a client. The average enrollment rate after twelve months for optimized clients who began enrollment in January 2019 is over 50%. We have a significant opportunity at our existing clients to reach higher enrollment rates, particularly when we are able to obtain email access to prospective members. In 2019, we entered into an agreement with one of our channel partners that allows us to access all available emails from our joint clients, which provides us another pathway for member outreach and increased enrollment. 


• | Offer Additional Solutions that Expand Share of Wallet with Existing Clients (Product Density). We believe we are underpenetrated within our existing client base, which represents a significant growth opportunity for us. The vast majority of our clients’ members use Livongo for Diabetes. We have a significant opportunity with those clients to offer our Livongo for Hypertension, Livongo for Prediabetes and Weight Management, and Livongo for Behavioral Health by myStrength solutions. For members who have more than one chronic condition that is covered by the Livongo suite of solutions, we can cross-sell in order to enhance the member experience, improve clinical results, and also increase our revenue per member. Benefits accrue to clients who have multiple Livongo solutions, as they can achieve higher returns on their investments in Livongo, thanks to both the increase in the size of the population using Livongo solutions, as well as the deeper clinical improvement and cost savings opportunities that come from the whole person approach. 


• | Expand Client Base. We believe that our market remains underpenetrated. We will continue to invest in our direct sales and marketing efforts and our channel partners to continue to acquire new clients, including employers, health plans, government entities, and labor unions. We also believe there is significant potential for growth in other markets, including Medicare, fully insured employers, self-insured employers and Medicaid. We expect to continue to invest in expanding our client base within these markets. 


• | Continue to Grow the Capabilities of Our Platform. We constantly improve our platform and existing solutions. As we increase membership and generate new data from each of those members using our platform, we can deliver more effective solutions to our members, onboard new members more efficiently, grow our penetration at any given client, and improve the features of our solutions, as well as accelerate the development and delivery of new products to the market. 


• | Continued Business Development. We will continue to organically build new solutions and, where appropriate, execute on acquisitions and partnerships, to rapidly expand to other chronic conditions and help our members live better and healthier lives. 

Index to Financial Statements


• | Expand Internationally. Chronic condition management is a global issue and many of our large self-insured employer clients have populations abroad. Despite different healthcare systems, we believe our solutions are well suited for people living with chronic conditions around the globe, and we view this as a large longer-term opportunity. 

Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 615 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Competition
The market for our solutions is competitive and characterized by rapid change. The competitive success of our solutions is contingent on our ability to provide superior solutions and a strong value proposition for all stakeholders in the member’s health journey. We are pioneering a new category in healthcare, called Applied Health Signals, which is transforming the treatment of chronic conditions. We expect to face increasing competition, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages, as well as new entrants into our market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to be and remain intense. We currently face competition from a range of companies, including Virta Health Corp., Omada Health, Inc., Glooko, Inc., Hello Heart Inc., Lyra Health, Inc., Onduo LLC, and Ginger.io, Inc.
Our main competitors fall into the following categories:

• | private companies that offer point solutions for a single chronic condition instead of addressing the whole person;


• | large enterprises who are focused on or may enter the healthcare industry, including initiatives and partnerships launched by these large companies, which may offer or develop products or services with features or benefits that overlap with our solutions; and


• | digital health device manufacturers that facilitate the collection of data but offer limited interpretation, feedback or guidance.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | long-term outcomes;


• | ease of use and convenience;


• | price;


• | greater name and brand recognition;


• | longer operating histories;


• | greater market penetration;


• | larger and more established client and channel partner relationships;


• | larger sales forces and more established products and networks;


• | larger marketing budgets;


• | access to significantly greater financial, human, technical and other resources;


• | breadth, depth, and efficacy of offerings;


• | quality and reliability of solutions; and

Index to Financial Statements


• | employer, healthcare provider, government entity, and insurance carrier acceptance.

Although certain of our competitors enjoy greater resources, recognition, deeper customer relationships, larger existing customer bases, or more mature intellectual property portfolios, we believe we compete favorably across these factors. We create measurable, sustainable health improvements for members, our clients realize meaningful benefits and cost savings, and we enable healthcare providers to help improve the health of their patients even when they are outside the provider’s facility. As our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services, as well as players in the health system who may elect to develop their own offering and would have vast resources and relationships to leverage. In addition, we may expand into new markets, including international markets, and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplaces.
As of December 31, 2019, we had 23 issued patents and one pending patent application in the United States. As of December 31, 2019, we held 11 registered trademarks in the United States and also held six registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.livongo.com and www.mystrength.com. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business”
Regulatory Environment
As an Applied Health Signals company, offering solutions to empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives, we are required to comply with complex laws and regulations at both the state and federal level. Specifically, our solutions are subject to extensive regulation covering the privacy and security of personal health information. Because maintaining the safety of our devices and platform and keeping personal information secure and confidential are our most important responsibilities as a healthcare company, we have structured our operations with a focus on compliance. We continue to monitor and respond to changes in the regulatory landscape, however there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by such changes.
HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, particularly personal health information, or PHI. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI and requires the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI. We are regulated as both a business associate and covered entity under HIPAA. In addition to HIPAA, some states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. Such state laws can be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA, in which case we must comply with the more stringent law. As a result, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations in order to ensure we are in compliance with the stricter state laws.
In order to comply with the requirements of HIPAA and other similar state laws, we have implemented safeguards to protect our members’ PHI, including restricting the use and sharing of PHI, limiting access to PHI to authorized personnel, maintaining training programs on how to protect PHI and ensuring business associate agreements and data sharing agreements are in place with the appropriate parties.
Data Protection and Breaches
In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper disclosure of individuals’ PHI or other personal information. Certain states have reacted to these breaches by enacting laws and regulations requiring holders 
Index to Financial Statements

of such information to take additional steps, including responding to breaches in certain timeframes, to safeguard the information. Pursuant to HIPAA, we are required to report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients within 60 days of discovery of the breach. We are also required to notify the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and, in cases involving large breaches, to the media.
In addition to the HIPAA compliance measures discussed above, we encrypt and back up data, maintain company-wide security awareness training, enter into business associate agreements with our partners, as well as ensure our partners have implemented physical security and safeguards at the data centers where our data is stored and conduct regular internal and external security audits. Since 2016, we have been audited for SOC 2 compliance by an independent public accounting firm with unqualified opinions. Service Organization Controls, or SOC, are standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for reporting on internal controls implemented within a service organization.
Other Healthcare Regulations
In addition to data privacy laws, our operations and arrangements with healthcare professionals, clients, and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including without limitation fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; civil and criminal false claims laws; physician transparency laws; and state laws regarding the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing operations, and our interactions with healthcare professionals. Although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these healthcare laws and regulations, failure to maintain compliance could result in significant penalties and require changes in our business operations.
Compliance and Certifications
Our blood glucose meter was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, by premarket notification per the requirements of Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, allowing us to market our blood glucose meter in the United States. We have received a national provider identifier from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
We voluntarily engage third-party security auditors to test our systems and controls at least annually against the most widely recognized security standards and regulations. The International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, has developed a series of standards for information security and related areas. We have received certification for ISO 13485:2016 (Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems).
In addition, we are accredited by the Diabetes Education Accreditation Program of the American Association of Diabetes Educators and by the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies Program of the Accreditation Commission for Health Care. We are also a validated member of Cerner Corporation’s CareAware program, which assesses the compatibility and reliability of medical devices with certain offerings from Cerner Corporation.
