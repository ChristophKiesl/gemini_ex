Business
 
The Company’s business is to provide products, services and solutions to the drone industry. We design, develop, market, and sell drone software and products. Our business emphasis focusses on drones piloted with wearable display devices. These are head mounted displays (“HMDs”) for pilots. HMDs give pilots “first person view” (“FPV”) perspective to control their drone in flight. This is a unique experience where the pilot is interacting with an aircraft through visual immersion. In this augmented virtual reality, the pilot sees only what the drone sees, as if sitting in the pilot seat. This experience is accomplished by live streaming footage from a camera mounted on the nose of the drone directly into specially-designed goggles worn by the pilot. The image is transmitted via radio (traditionally analog but increasingly digital) to the pilot. The drone remote control unit, the drone device, and the FPV goggles are all inter-connected via radio. This effect requires sophisticated electronics that transmits visual information with sufficient speed and reliability to allow pilot control over the drone in real-time. Pilots routinely achieve speeds of over 90 mph in racing and other mission critical applications. An FPV pilot must experience a near complete transfer of their visual consciousness into the body of their piloted device.
 
There are three common categories of FPV flight – freestyle flight, racing and aerial photography. In freestyle the pilot navigates around obstacles, focused on acrobatics and exploring the environment around the aircraft through the HMD. This type of flight includes remote utility and crop inspection with onboard navigation and special equipment, such as moisture or heat sensors, and package delivery. FPV racing describes a growing spectator sport where pilots fly their drones in competitions through a series of obstacles, flags, and gates in a racetrack. Aerial photography is the process of viewing and recording a subject matter from the air from the viewpoint of the pilot.
 
We sell FPV flight systems are sold through our Rotor Riot and Fat Shark subsidiaries. We sell flight design cameras, video transmitters, goggles, as well as the mounts, airframes and accessories to build or operate drone aircraft. We design, develop, assemble and sell each of these FPV components individually and in packages. We believe our products have become favorites in FPV racing and we sponsor several racing teams and pilots. We purchase and resell drones and components from leading manufacturers, including industry leader DJI and custom design and build our own line of branded products. Prior to our acquisition of Fat Shark, approximately 50% of our revenue had been generated as a reseller and the balance from the sale of our branded products.
 
We market through social media and attract buyers to our ecommerce platforms. We maintain a robust presence on Facebook and YouTube where we sponsor competitions and provide education. Sports networks, and sponsors such as NBC, Sky, Liberty Media, Fox Sports, MGM, Hearst, Twitter, ProSieben, Groupe AB and Weibo broadcast and sponsor global events where professional pilots and amateurs compete for prizes and sponsorships. Drone racing is a global sport with chapters, leagues, and pilots and established guidelines, rules and regulations for participation adopted by organizations such as MultiGP, Drone Racing League (“DRL”), IUDRO, DR1 Racing, Rotomatch League, FPVR, and Freespace Drone Racing. Pilots specially design their custom built aircraft, selecting and customizing frames, motors, propellors and controllers for speed and maneuverability from Rotor Riot. Rotor Riot sponsors a team of six of the leading pilots on the competitive FPV racing circuit, including the 2019 and 2018 Drone Racing League champion. Drone pilots and spectators alike experience real-time flight through their own HMD. In 2015 Fat Shark sponsored the first annual US National Drone Racing Championships held at the California State Fair with a prize of $25,000. Subsequent events featured prizes of up to $1 million.

On November 2, 2020 we acquired Fat Shark. The Company believes Fat Shark and its subsidiaries are leaders in the design, development, marketing and sale of HMDs for pilots.
 
The operations of Fat Shark are expected to constitute a significant majority of our revenue and results of operations and will position us to become a fully-integrated drone business with a strong supply chain while we continue to develop and promote industry standards through our blockchain-based distributed network that provides secure data storage, operational analytics, reporting, and SaaS solutions for the drone industry. We are also developing the means to accurately track, report and review flight data, which we believe will be the mainstay of future regulatory specifications and insurability. We maintain a commitment to deliver unparalleled innovation to make drones, pilots, and products accountable and the sky a safer place. 
 
In addition, we are developing a blockchain-based black box to enhance reliability and reporting of drone performance and operations as software as a service (“SaaS”). Red Cat’s Dronebox software and platform enable an easy-to-use flight log system that keeps clients compliant with regulators and helps track and collect critical drone data and feed the data to various applications. The software and platform use a patent-pending blockchain-based cloud architecture. To keep the data secure, we hash each log file on our private block chain, proving that the data is immutable and reliable. Reliable data is mandatory for regulators and insurance companies and is essential for analyzing drone flights and effective drone fleet management. Through our blockchain-based black box for drones, we can offer one easy to use system for analytics and services. By applying machine learning to the log files, we can prevent drone flight problems before they happen through artificial intelligence. We charge a monthly recurring fee for each drone in the customer’s drone fleet. We store all flight logs, photos, and videos from the black box service, which allows detailed flight replay.
 
Business Strategy
 
Prior to 2020, we were focused on research and development of software solutions that could provide secure cloud-based analytics, storage and services for the drone industry. In May 2020, we launched “Dronebox” for beta testing. Our current strategy involves expanding into product design, development and sales while continuing research and development into SaaS software opportunities. We principally focus on commercial and consumer (non-military) markets for drone products and services, although we are continually exploring opportunities to expand into governmental and military applications.
The Drone Industry
 
Drones are rapidly moving beyond their military origin to become a powerful business tool and recreational activity. We expect both of these markets to continue to grow.

According to Business Insider Intelligence, industry reports project that
commercial use of drones will reach 2.4 million by 2023, a 66% compounded annual growth rate. Drones will be employed by the agriculture,
construction and mining, insurance, and media and telecommunications industries. The drone services market is expected to grow to over
$60 billion by 2025, from $4.4 billion in 2018. Consumer drone shipments will reach 29 million by 2021.
Spending on drones is projected to reach more than $16 billion in 2020 and
experience a compounded annual growth rate of 33% through 2025 as reported by International Data Corporation.
The small drone market size is projected to increase to $40 billion by 2025
from $13.4 billion in 2018 according to Markets and Markets,
The FAA has forecasted a 300% increase in commercial drones from 2019 to
2023 as per businessinsider.com.

Customers
 
Our revenue is principally derived from online sales. We currently market our products and services to recreational and professional drone pilots and hobbyists. During 2019, sales to GetFPV, RCCarMax, and BangGood each represented more than 10% of Fat Shark’s revenue. Our SaaS software under development is expected to be marketed to a significantly larger marketplace, namely fleet operators, insurance, and government, including military, commercial and civil aviation. The FAA continues to issue new rules and regulations which are designed to build a traffic management ecosystem for drones which is separate from, but complementary to, existing air traffic control. For example, in December 2019, the FAA proposed a rule which would require drones to be capable of remote identification, similar to civilian and military aviation. We plan to market Dronebox in each sector of the drone industry, including military, commercial, civil, and consumer.

Competition
 
Rotor Riot competes with a number of significantly larger, better capitalized companies. SZ DJI Technology Company, Ltd., commonly known as DJI, is the dominant market leader in the civilian drone industry with a global market share estimated at more than 70%, according to many industry research firms. Other competitors include Parrotand Lumenier. Race Day Quads is a larger, direct competitor in the FPV sector. We compete against these financially stronger companies by leveraging our visibility on the internet through our Facebook page which has more than 33,000 members and our Rotor Riot channel which has more than 192,000 subscribers. The Rotor Riot brand has been at the center of the racing and freestyle culture of drones since registering its domain name in 2015. Rotor Riot sponsors a team of six of the leading FPV pilots on the competitive racing circuit, including the Drone Racing League champion pilot in 2019 and 2018.
 
Dronebox will compete against a smaller number of companies, most of which are also smaller in size. These competitors include Airdata, Kittyhawk, DroneLogbook and Skyward, which was acquired by Verizon in 2017. While these companies provide certain drone tracking capabilities, we believe that Dronebox will elevate the quality and quantity of features offered through the platform. For example, we plan to enhance the user interface experience and introduce new functionality including a ticketing system which will enable users to track the resolution of mechanical and other flight issues that need to be resolved.
 Suppliers
 
Rotor Riot purchases its inventory from over 60 suppliers. 35% of this inventory is purchased from three vendors. The two most critical components are electronics and frames. 41% of Rotor Riot's electronics and frames are purchased from two vendors. The United States has continuously increased tariffs on the inventory that Rotor Riot purchases from China. Since 2019, tariffs ranging from 2% to 25% have been imposed on 88% of Rotor Riot’s inventory. 68% of Rotor Riot's inventory is purchased directly from Chinese based vendors, all of these items are subject to tariffs. An additional 20% is purchased from vendors that are affected by the tariffs resulting in increase in costs to Rotor Riot. 28% of Rotor Riot’s inventory consists of DJI products which are subject to the highest 25% tariff rate. These tariffs increase the cost of goods which reduces the company’s profit margins. Rotor Riot has been unable to find comparable non-Chinese products and vendors.
Government Regulation and Federal Policy of Drones 
 
The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) of the United States Department of Transportation responsible is for the regulation and oversight of civil aviation within the U.S. Its primary mission is to ensure the safety of civil aviation. The FAA has adopted the name unmanned aircraft (“UA”) to describe aircraft systems without a flight crew on board. More common names include drone, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and remotely operated aircraft.
 
The FAA began issuing regulations governing drones in 2005 with their scope and frequency expanding in recent years with the significant increase in the number of drones sold. In December 2015, the FAA announced that all drones weighing more than 250 grams, or 0.55 pounds, must be registered with the FAA. As of March 2020, the FAA reported the registration of 1,563,263 drones, of which 441,709 were commercial and 1,117,900 were recreational, and the certification of 171,744 remote pilots. 
 
In December 2019, the FAA announced a proposed rule that would continue the safe integration of drones into the nation’s airspace by requiring them to be identifiable remotely. The FAA believes that remote ID technologies will enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA, law enforcement, and federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction. These efforts lay the foundation for more complex operations, such as those beyond visual line of sight at low altitudes, as the FAA and the drone industry move toward a traffic management ecosystem for Unmanned Aircraft System flights separate from, but complimentary to, the air traffic management system.
 
The Company believes that the oversight of the FAA is beneficial to the drone industry generally, and the Company specifically. Approximately 10 % of the drones sold by Rotor Riot are below the weight threshold required to register. The remaining 90% have more functionality, are more likely to be used for commercial purposes, and therefore, should be registered. The Company believes that the regulations issued by the FAA, such as the remote identification standard, will provide opportunities as such functionality could be offered through our Dronebox platform.
 
The FAA continues to issue new rules and regulations which are designed to build a traffic management ecosystem for drones. For example, in December 2019, the FAA proposed a rule which would require drones to be identified remotely. We plan to build this feature into Dronebox.

Environmental Considerations
 
While the operation of many businesses have some form of negative impact on the environment, drones have a unique ability to provide a positive contribution. Many of these relate to a drone’s ability to reach places in a more efficient manner, and include such activities as:
 
• aerial mapping and nature monitoring;
 • maintenance of renewal energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines;
 • disaster relief monitoring and relief delivery; and
 • agricultural sustainability solutions
 
Intellectual Property
 
The Company holds trademarks on the Rotor Riot brand name and logo.  The Company holds a provisional patent application for the tracking of unmanned aerial systems which expires in November 2020.Employees
 
As of July 28, 2021, the Company had 14 full-time employees.
 
Research and Development
 
During the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred research and development costs of $516,084 and $488,990, respectively, excluding $1,269,987 and $55,936 of stock-based compensation, respectively.
