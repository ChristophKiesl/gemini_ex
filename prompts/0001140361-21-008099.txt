Overview
 
Ocuphire is a clinical-stage ophthalmic biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of several eye disorders. Ocuphire’s pipeline currently includes two small molecule product candidates targeting front and back of the eye indications.
 
Its lead product candidate, Nyxol® Eye Drops (“Nyxol”), is a once-daily eye drop formulation of phentolamine mesylate designed to reduce pupil diameter and improve visual acuity. As a result, Nyxol can potentially be used for the treatment of multiple indications such as dim light or night vision disturbances (“NVD”), pharmacologically-induced mydriasis (which refers to the use of pharmacological agents to dilate the pupil for office-based eye exams) and presbyopia (a gradual, age-related loss of the eyes’ ability to focus on nearby objects). Ocuphire management believes this multiple indication potential represents a significant market opportunity. Nyxol has been studied across three Phase 1 and four Phase 2 trials totaling over 230 patients and has demonstrated promising clinical data for use in multiple ophthalmic indications. Ocuphire initiated a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of NVD in the fourth quarter of 2020, a Phase 3 trial for reversal of pharmacologically-induced mydriasis (“RM”) in the fourth quarter of 2020, and initiated a Phase 2 trial in combination with low dose pilocarpine for presbyopia, in the first quarter of 2021. Ocuphire expects top-line results to read out as early as the first quarter of 2021 and throughout the remainder of 2021, and, assuming successful and timely completion of further trials, anticipates submitting a new drug application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in early 2023 under the 505(b)(2) pathway.
 
Ocuphire’s second product candidate, APX3330, is a twice-a-day oral tablet designed to target multiple pathways relevant to retinal and choroidal (the vascular layer of the eye) vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (“DR”) and diabetic macular edema (“DME”) which, if left untreated, can result in permanent visual acuity loss and eventual blindness. DR is a disease resulting from diabetes in which chronically elevated blood sugar levels cause progressive damage to blood vessels in the retina. DME is a severe form of DR which involves leakage of protein and fluid into the macula, the central portion of the retina, causing swelling and damage. Prior to Ocuphire’s in-licensing of the product candidate, APX3330 had been studied by third parties in six Phase 1 and five Phase 2 trials totaling over 440 patients for inflammatory and oncology indications, and had demonstrated promising evidence of tolerability, pharmacokinetics, durability, and target engagement. Ocuphire plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for APX3330 in the first quarter of 2021 for the treatment of patients with DR, including moderately severe non-proliferative DR (“NPDR”) and mild proliferative DR (“PDR”), as well as patients with DME without loss of central vision. Ocuphire has also in-licensed APX2009 and APX2014, which are additional second-generation product candidates and analogs of APX3330.
 
As part of its strategy, Ocuphire will continue to explore opportunities to acquire additional ophthalmic assets and to seek strategic partners for late-stage development, regulatory preparation and commercialization of drugs in key global markets.
 
Merger
 
On November 5, 2020, Ocuphire (formerly known as Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and prior to the merger, referred to as “Rexahn”), completed its reverse merger with Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. (“Private Ocuphire”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 17, 2020, as amended, by and among Rexahn, Private Ocuphire, and Razor Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rexahn (“Merger Sub”) (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Ocuphire, with Private Ocuphire surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Rexahn (the “Merger”).

In connection with, and immediately prior to the completion of, the Merger, Rexahn effected a reverse stock split of the common stock, at a ratio of 1-for-4 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, after considering the Reverse Stock Split, Rexahn issued shares of its common stock to Private Ocuphire stockholders, based on a common stock exchange ratio of 1.0565 shares of common stock for each share of Private Ocuphire common stock. In connection with the Merger, Rexahn changed its name from “Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” to “Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.,” and the business conducted by Rexahn became the business conducted by Private Ocuphire.
 
Strategy
 
Ocuphire estimates that there are 16 million moderate-to-severe NVD patients in the United States, over 100 million eye exams conducted per year with pharmacologically-induced mydriasis, over 120 million presbyopia patients, over 7 million patients with DR, and 750,000 patients with DME. There are no currently approved pharmacological products on the market for NVD, RM, or presbyopia. In the case of presbyopia there are non-pharmacologic and potentially inconvenient treatments such as reading glasses or contact lenses, as well as invasive surgical interventions with associated risks such as creation or worsening of NVD. For DR and DME, intraocular injections targeting vascular endothelial growth factors (“VEGF”) (a family of proteins that promote angiogenesis – the formation of new blood vessels – and vascular permeability) are approved globally, but these chronic therapies require frequent biweekly or monthly office visits and are prone to side effects such as hemorrhage, intraocular infection, and increased risk of blood clots.
 
 Ocuphire is developing Nyxol and APX3330 for multiple indications. Ocuphire believes the two programs present similar potential advantages: (1) promising clinical data to date; (2) small molecules; (3) convenient dosing route and schedule; (4) potential for first-line or adjunct therapy; and (5) significant commercial potential. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Ocuphire initiated Phase 3 clinical trials for Nyxol in NVD and RM, with announcement of completion of enrollment in Phase 3 RM trial in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021,Ocuphire initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept trial in presbyopia for a kit combination of Nyxol and low-dose pilocarpine, a pupil constrictor with a different, but complementary mechanism to Nyxol. In preparation for at least one of the two Phase 3 registration trials for Nyxol, Ocuphire has launched a blow-fill-seal (“BFS”) manufacturing program for preservative-free single use Nyxol eye drops. Furthermore, Ocuphire initiated a 6-month rabbit toxicology study in the first quarter of 2021, completion of which is necessary prior to commencement of the Phase 3 safety exposure trial for chronic indications. Ocuphire also expects to launch a Phase 2 trial for APX3330 in DR and DME in the first quarter of 2021 with a concurrent Phase 2/3 oral tablet manufacturing program. TABLE 1 below summarizes Ocuphire’s current development pipeline of product candidates and their target indications:


TABLE 1. Ocuphire Pipeline Indications
 

Note: 0.75% Nyxol (Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution) is the same as 1% Nyxol (Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution).
 
Based on the safety and efficacy data generated to date, as well as expected data from the planned trials, Ocuphire anticipates submitting an NDA to the FDA for Nyxol in early 2023 utilizing the 505(b)(2) pathway of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), which the FDA indicated would be acceptable for the Nyxol application. In addition, Ocuphire anticipates advancing APX3330 towards an NDA in the future. Ocuphire further anticipates that in the long term, it will also submit marketing applications with regulators in other global markets, initially considering the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and potentially other markets such as China.

Nyxol
 
Nyxol is an ophthalmic solution containing phentolamine mesylate, a non-selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist that acts on the adrenergic nervous system and inhibits contraction of smooth muscle. Phentolamine mesylate, the drug substance and active component of Nyxol, is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in two FDA-approved drugs, REGITINE® and OraVerse®. REGITINE, an injectable approved in 1952, is used mainly to treat pre- or intra-operative hypertensive episodes in patients with pheochromocytoma. OraVerse, approved in 2007, is an intraoral submucosal injection used to reverse anesthesia after oral surgery. The FDA has stated that it would be acceptable for the Nyxol application to reference the FDA’s previous finding of safety and efficacy for Regitine® (Phentolamine Mesylate Injection, NDA 008278) and Oraverse® (Phentolamine Mesylate Injection, NDA 22159).
 
Phentolamine mesylate reformulated as Nyxol for topical ophthalmic use inhibits the iris dilator muscles, effectively decreasing the size of the pupil opening. With a smaller pupil diameter (PD), less light is scattered on the retina by imperfections in the periphery of the cornea and lens, resulting in better low contrast best-corrected distance visual acuity (“LCVA”) as well as distance and near high contrast visual acuity (“VA”). Ocuphire estimates that in the United States, there are 16 million moderate-to-severe NVD patients and over 120 million presbyopia patients. Additionally, more than 100 million eye exams are conducted per year, causing pharmacologically-induced mydriasis and impairing vision for a duration ranging from a few hours (typically six hours) up to 24 hours. Ocuphire believes that Nyxol possesses a differentiated product profile compared to other options on the market and in clinical development for its target indications.
 
Key attributes of Ocuphire’s product candidate Nyxol include the following:
 

• | Reduction in pupil diameter with durable effects. In multiple Phase 2 trials Nyxol reduced pupil diameter by approximately 20% (~1 – 1.5 mm) in both mesopic (dim) and photopic (bright) conditions, with such reductions sustained over 24 hours. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improvement in low contrast visual acuity. When studied in patients with NVD in multiple Phase 2 trials, Nyxol showed statistically significant improvement in low contrast mesopic best-corrected distance visual acuity at ≥1 and ≥2 lines, with a trend at ≥3 lines on a standard visual chart. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promising tolerability profile. To date, Nyxol has been observed to be well tolerated, with unchanged or decreased intraocular pressure in the 7 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials conducted. Nyxol produces a transient, mild hyperemia effect that disappears within 4 to 8 hours or immediately upon application of anti-redness eye drops. Nyxol is also observed to have no systemic effects such as changes in blood pressure or heart rate. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designed to be a convenient, once-daily eye drop. Nyxol is being evaluated for chronic use as a once-daily administration before bedtime. Nyxol has also been shown in multiple Phase 2 trials to have an over 24-hour durable effect, which could allow for better patient compliance. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 9
 
 

• | Stable, cost-effective ophthalmic formulation. Nyxol is a single-use, preservative-free, proprietary eye drop formulation with good stability for eventual commercialization. Its active pharmaceutical ingredient, phentolamine mesylate USP grade, is a small molecule with advantages of standardized, scalable, lower-cost manufacturing processes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ocuphire is initially pursuing Nyxol for the following 3 indications as a first-line therapy, and in the case of presbyopia, as a kit combination of Nyxol and low-dose pilocarpine:
 

• | NVD, a condition in which peripheral imperfections (aberrations) of the cornea scatter light when the pupil opens wide in dim light. Patients with NVD experience glare, halos, starbursts, and decreased contrast sensitivity. NVD is a new indication with no approved therapies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RM, a reversal of pharmacologically induced dilation of the pupils, where dilation leads to increased sensitivity to light and an inability to focus, making it difficult to read, work, and drive. RM is a single-use indication with no commercially available therapies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Presbyopia, a condition in which the eye’s lens loses elasticity, affecting its ability to focus on near objects. Presbyopia typically occurs after age 40 and most patients use reading glasses in order to read or see objects close to them. There are no currently approved pharmacological therapies for presbyopia, but those in development plan to create a small pupil to better focus images on the retina via the “pinhole effect”. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
APX3330
 
APX3330 (E3330), originally developed by Eisai Co., Ltd. and Apexian Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a small molecule that specifically targets Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1/Redox Factor-1 (APE-1/Ref-1, referred to as Ref-1), a dual function protein involved in the regulation of transcription factors critical to cell signaling. Ref-1 regulates inflammation, angiogenesis (blood vessel formation), and reduction-oxidation (redox) signaling, as well as DNA repair that is critical to normal function of neurons.
 
By inhibiting redox activity and not DNA repair, APX3330 has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce angiogenesis and inflammation via modulation of several important proangiogenic and proinflammatory transcription factors such as NF-κB and HIF-1a and its downstream target, VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor). These transcription factors are implicated in multiple pathways relevant to the pathophysiology of retinal and choroidal vascular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and wAMD. Moreover, data from these preclinical studies suggest that APX3330 is a promising candidate for clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety of an oral systemic therapy to treat these important diseases.
 
Ocuphire estimates that APX3330 has the potential to reach many patients. According to the National Eye Institute, there are over 7 million patients with DR and 750,000 patients with DME in the United States. In addition, over 1 million patients in the United States suffer from wAMD. These retinal and choroidal vascular diseases, which cause damage to the macula, are leading causes of severe, permanent vision loss.
 
Key attributes of Ocuphire’s product candidate APX3330 include the following:
 

• | Potential to be the first oral therapy. Compared to frequent intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, associated with ocular complications, twice a day oral administration of APX3330 could be a convenient alternative treatment for retinal disease, if approved. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Upstream target implicated in two validated pathways. APX3330 is designed to lead to inhibition of two validated cell signaling pathways (angiogenesis and inflammation) known to cause various retinal diseases. Moreover, the APX3330 mechanism of action is distinct by working upstream of the current anti-VEGF therapies, thus Ocuphire believes it could complement anti-VEGF therapies and potentially reduce frequency of doctor visits. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 10
 
 

• | Promising tolerability profile. In 11 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, APX3330 was well tolerated with no significant acute neurologic, cardiovascular, liver, or pulmonary events. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable, cost-effective oral tablet. APX3330 is formulated as an oral tablet with stability suitable for eventual commercialization, and its active pharmaceutical ingredient is a small molecule with the advantages of standardized, scalable, lower-cost manufacturing processes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ocuphire is initially pursuing APX3330 for the following indications as a first-line or adjunctive therapy:
 

• | DR, the leading cause of vision loss in adults aged 20–74 years, which results from chronic elevations of glucose in the blood that lead to cell damage in the retina.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DME, one of the most common complications of DR, in which vascular leakage causes damage to the macula, the part of the eye that is critical for central and color vision. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | wAMD, a chronic eye disorder that causes visual distortions in the central part of one’s vision, in which abnormal blood vessels leak fluid or blood into the macula, the part of the eye that is critical for central and color vision. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Ocuphire’s goal is to build a leading ophthalmic biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes best-in-class therapies for patients and provides attractive solutions for physicians and payers. The key elements of Ocuphire’s strategy to achieve its goal are the following:
 

• | Advance the clinical development of Nyxol and APX3330. Ocuphire is preparing to conduct registration studies of Nyxol and proof of concept studies of APX3330 with the objective of filing a U.S. NDA in early 2023 for Nyxol and advancing APX3330 towards an NDA in the future. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target Nyxol and APX3330 for large ophthalmic indications. Ocuphire believes Nyxol has therapeutic potential to improve vision performance in NVD, RM, and presbyopia. Ocuphire also believes AXP3330 has potential to improve the health of the retina in patients with diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and wAMD, while reducing the burden of intravitreal injections. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain and expand its intellectual property portfolio. Ocuphire owns all global patent rights to Nyxol with respect to its formulation, combinations, and use in multiple indications. Ocuphire also owns an exclusive worldwide sublicense for the Ref-1 Inhibitor program, including its lead product candidate APX3330, for all its ophthalmic and diabetic indications, and compositions and methods of use for Ref-1 pipeline candidates, including APX2009 and APX2014. Ocuphire continues to explore additional opportunities to expand and extend this intellectual property protection, both in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the global commercial value of Nyxol and APX3330. Ocuphire plans to seek commercial partners both in and outside of the United States. Alternatively, Ocuphire believes it could independently commercialize Nyxol and/or APX3330 in the United States with a targeted sales force. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities. Ocuphire’s team is well qualified to identify and in-license or acquire clinical-stage ophthalmological assets and is evaluating opportunities to expand and diversify its pipeline.

Overview of Eye Disease Market
 
The global ophthalmology drugs and devices market is expected to grow to $31.5 billion by 2025. While North America is the largest worldwide market for the treatment of eye disease, the Asian market is expected to experience the most significant growth as healthcare infrastructure improves in the region. This market spans at least 2.2 billion people worldwide who suffer from a vision impairment or blindness, and the prevalence of eye disease is only expected to grow both in the United States and internationally due to an aging population. Eye diseases associated with age include macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, presbyopia, and NVD. Current procedures such as LASIK and multifocal intraocular lens implants also contribute to temporary or permanent impairments in vision performance. As the prevalence and awareness of eye disease increases, Ocuphire believes there will be an accompanying increase in demand for eye disease treatments.
Anterior (Front) Eye Disease Market
 
Millions of Americans suffer from conditions in the front of the eye. Patients have either nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) that requires correction with contacts, glasses, and sunglasses. These types of refractive errors do not always have to be present at a young age. Patients over the age of 40 years old can develop presbyopia, a decreased ability to see objects at a near distance. This condition impacts over 100 million Americans and usually requires reading glasses and/or contact lenses for focusing on near objects. The myopia and presbyopia market is currently estimated at $17.8 billion (2020) and forecasted to increase to $28.0 billion in 2026. Further, approximately 4 million patients undergo surgical removal of cataracts, i.e., the clouding of the lens usually associated with age.
 
Glaucoma, another anterior eye disease, is characterized by degeneration of the optic nerve leading to irreversible vision loss and is usually associated with increased intraocular pressure. It comprises a large component of the anterior eye disease market as revenue from pharmacologic treatment for this disease is projected to reach $2.2 billion by 2023.
 
Retinal (Back of the Eye) Disease Market
 
Retinal damage is one of the leading causes of blindness and continues to grow with aging and larger diabetic populations around the world. Many retinal diseases are complications of diabetes such as DR and DME that can be treated with anti-VEGF agents to suppress VEGF signaling. Currently, there are several drugs on the market indicated for anti-VEGF therapy, including Lucentis® (ranibizumab), a monoclonal antibody marketed by Genentech, and EYLEA® (aflibercept), a recombinant fusion protein marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., that have become the standard of care for treating severe forms of DME and wAMD amongst other retinal conditions. Avastin® (bevacizumab), a monoclonal antibody marketed by Genentech, is also used off-label to treat these same indications as it is more cost-effective than the other branded drugs. These three injectable drugs are biologics with treatment administered in an ophthalmologist’s office. Annual worldwide sales of Lucentis and EYLEA for all indications totaled over $6 billion in 2019 ($2 billion for Lucentis and over $4 billion for EYLEA).
Ocuphire’s Target Indications
 
NVD (Nyxol)
 
NVD Overview
  Vision at night or in dim light conditions is different from daytime vision in several important ways. Most notably, at night, the pupils dilate to allow more light into the eye. Diminished night vison is a natural part of aging as well as a common side effect of several conditions and procedures. NVD is caused by peripheral imperfections (aberrations) of the cornea which scatter light when the pupil dilates in dim light conditions. These imperfections can be naturally occurring, especially with age, or surgically-induced from refractive procedures such as LASIK. As the pupil dilates in response to mesopic conditions, light passes through the periphery of the cornea and lens, unlike during photopic conditions. Any imperfections or aberrations present on the periphery cause light to reach the retina in a non-focused and scattered way, creating glare, halos, starbursts, ghosting, and a loss of contrast sensitivity (“CS”). These visual disturbances can be debilitating to a variety of everyday activities, especially driving. The light emitted by traffic lights and other cars scatters and obscures most of the visual field, making driving in dim light conditions hazardous. Glare, in particular, can be dangerous while driving. In one study of 297 drivers given vision tests that correlate with accidents, 45% of the drivers who reported difficulty driving at night were unable to perform any of the tests with glare.


 12
 
 
 The effects of NVD can be reduced or eliminated by reducing the pupil size to a smaller diameter that prevents the scattering effect without impeding the ability to see at night. NVD can occur naturally (night myopia) and is commonly caused by ocular surgery (“LASIK”). One significant cause of night myopia is keratoconus, an orphan disease that starts at a young age with progressive thinning of the cornea usually due to genetic and environmental causes. Ocuphire estimates there are about 38 million individuals in the US that suffer from NVD, with an estimated 16 million having moderate-to-severe NVD that may be directly addressable with a pupil management approach. Market research conducted by GlobalData of patients who self-report NVD showed 25% completely avoid driving at night. Furthermore, 67% who report moderate or severe NVD would be willing to try an eye drop treatment option. These patients can be segmented by the origins of their vision disturbance. Approximately 44% of NVD are the result of night myopia, followed by approximately 30% from cortical cataracts, 15% from post-intraocular lens (“IOL”) implants, and 10% following LASIK surgery. These conditions span an age range of late teenagers to those 80 years and older.
 
Limitations of Existing Treatments for NVD
 
The biggest challenge for the treatment of NVD is the lack of safe, tolerable, convenient, and effective treatments. Despite a large number of addressable patients with moderate-to-severe NVD, there is no FDA-approved treatment on the market for NVD. Some commonly used tools such as tinted glasses are not effective, and in fact, may worsen patients’ vision at night. Off-label use of approved miotic agents, such as regular-strength pilocarpine, are unsuitable for the treatment of NVD because they reduce pupil size to a degree that may impede safe night vision and may cause loss of accommodation.
 
Nyxol Opportunity in NVD
 
Ocuphire believes it may have a new NVD treatment option that could improve patients’ ability to see in dim lighting and significantly improve their quality of life. Nyxol is currently the only product candidate in development for NVD and could become the first pharmacological treatment option if approved. In addition to a potential first-mover advantage, Nyxol is being developed to be administered via convenient, once-daily dosing before bedtime and has been shown in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials to improve low contrast visual acuity in mesopic (dim) conditions on the standard visual chart. Nyxol has also been shown to be well-tolerated in these trials. Like some ocular eyedrops, mild, transient hyperemia has occurred in these trials following the application of Nyxol, but has generally faded within several hours.
 
RM (Nyxol)
 
Mydriasis Overview
 
Every year in the U.S., approximately 100 million eye exams are performed that require dilation of the pupil (mydriasis) to examine the back of the eye either for routine check-ups, disease monitoring or surgical procedures. The mydriasis is achieved either by stimulating the iris dilator muscle with the use of alpha agonists (e.g., phenylephrine), or by blocking the iris sphincter muscle with the use of muscarinic antagonists (e.g., tropicamide) or a combination of both mydriatic agents. Typically, pharmacologically induced mydriasis dilates the pupil to 7 mm to 8 mm, a size suitable for ophthalmic examination of the retina and other structures of the interior of the eye. Such pharmacologically induced mydriasis can last from a few hours (typically 6 hours) up to 24 hours, depending on the pigmentation of the iris, one’s age, and other factors. Side effects of mydriasis include sensitivity to light and blurred vision, which make it difficult to read, work, or drive. Many dilating drops also cause cycloplegia, the temporary paralysis of the muscle which allows the eye to focus on near objects. For this reason, many patients may request to avoid dilation, thus limiting the eye care provider’s ability to conduct a comprehensive exam.
Limitations of Existing Treatments for Reversal of Mydriasis
 
There are no currently approved products on the market for reversal of mydriasis and Ocuphire is not aware of any others in development. In 1990, the FDA approved the selective alpha-1 antagonist dapiprazole, marketed as Rev-Eyes®, to reverse mydriasis induced by adrenergic or anticholinergic agents. Rev-Eyes was eventually withdrawn from the market for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy, according to the FDA.
 
 13
 
 
Nyxol Opportunity in RM
 
Nyxol may potentially expedite the reversal of mydriasis prior to natural reversal. According to GlobalData market research, over 65% of patients report a moderate to severe negative impact of a dilated exam, underscoring the potential value of Nyxol’s role in improving comfort and daily function after pupil dilation. Additionally, an estimated 45% of patients responded that they would be very likely to request a dilation reversal drop, and more than 40% of eye care providers would be likely to use a reversal drop if such a treatment were commercially available. Ocuphire believes that many people who undergo pupil dilation would benefit from a reversal treatment that has the potential to get patients back to their normal routines faster and avoid the subjective “discomfort” of dilation. Ocuphire also believes that if providers can offer a reversal drop there could potentially be more compliance with annual dilated eye exams.
 
Presbyopia (Nyxol)
 
Presbyopia Overview
 
Presbyopia is an age-related condition with onset most common in people over 40 years old. As the eye ages, the lens becomes stiffer, which limits the eye’s ability to adjust its focus for reading or for other tasks that require clear vision at near distances. Presbyopia patients experience blurred near vision, difficulty seeing in dim light, and eye strain. In young healthy eyes, lenses are able to focus light from objects at different distances by a process called accommodation. During accommodation, muscles surrounding the lens contract, causing the lens to change shape and increasing the focusing power of the eye. This allows dynamic, clear vision at both near and far distances. With increasing age, the lens becomes stiffer as the structural crystallin proteins become misfolded. This increased lens stiffness limits the eye’s ability to adjust its focus for reading or for other tasks that require clear vision at near distances. Because of the ubiquity of the condition, presbyopia represents a large market both in the United States and abroad totaling over 2 billion presbyopia patients. It is estimated that 120 million Americans have presbyopia and this number is expected to grow as the population above the age of 45 increases.
Limitations of Existing Treatments for Presbyopia
 
There is currently no approved pharmacological treatment for presbyopia. The available treatments for presbyopia include reading glasses, bifocals, gradients, bifocal contact lenses, and multifocal intraocular lenses. Reading glasses can be inconvenient and must be taken off and put on frequently throughout the day to see objects at far and near distances, respectively. Many patients express frustration with losing or forgetting their glasses. Additionally, some patients find glasses unflattering. Contact lenses for presbyopia also have drawbacks. They can only be used monocularly, where one eye is fitted with a presbyopic lens while the other is used for distance vision, which often leads to eye strain and other negative side effects.
 
A small portion of patients elect surgical intervention, including laser treatment to achieve monovision and insertion of KAMRA Inlays, a plastic implant into the cornea of the non-dominant eye to increase its depth of field. The risks of such interventions are those associated with all ocular surgeries, such as a potential decrease in contrast sensitivity and the creation or worsening of NVD.
 
Nyxol Opportunity in Presbyopia
 
Pupil diameter management is a promising strategy for the pharmacological treatment of presbyopia. Nyxol alone has shown in multiple Phase 2 trials the ability to reduce pupil diameter size by 15-20% and improve near visual acuity by one to two lines for at least 24 hours after a single evening application. Research suggests that reducing pupil size to a diameter of 1.6 mm to 2 mm range (dosed in the daytime) will lead to significant improvement in presbyopia symptoms by increasing depth of focus. In order to enhance Nyxol pupil reduction to reach the 1.6mm daytime pupil target size, Ocuphire is evaluating the efficacy of a kit combination Nyxol (dosed in the evening) and low-dose pilocarpine (dosed in the daytime).

With respect to the treatment of presbyopia, Ocuphire believes that tolerability, convenience, and preservation of distance vision quality are of the utmost importance. Presbyopia is considered a “benign” condition, in that there is no risk of death or complete vision loss. Thus, any therapies without robust tolerability will not be suitable alternatives to reading glasses or contact lenses. Nyxol is being developed to be applied once daily before bed, with potential resolution of any mild hyperemia by morning. According to GlobalData market research, 40% of patients would request an alternative to reading glasses if available, and 69% of patients would consider an eye drop alternative. Ocuphire believes that many presbyopes who are unsatisfied with their reading glasses or monocular contact lenses, and who would prefer a less invasive alternative than surgical intervention, would find Nyxol eye drops a promising option, if approved.
 
Other Indications: Glaucoma (Nyxol)
 
 Glaucoma is a progressive, age-related disease and the leading cause of irreversible vision loss, affecting 60 million people worldwide, including 3 million people in the United States. Glaucoma is the result of increased intraocular pressure (“IOP”) due to a buildup of aqueous humor in the eye. Sustained elevated IOP damages the optic nerve, resulting in loss of vision and blindness. There are currently five classes of approved glaucoma medications, yet for many patients current medications are not sufficiently effective as monotherapy, and taking two or more medications leads to decreased patient adherence. Second-line treatments, especially for patients in normotensive range, are needed to decrease patients’ IOP levels. Potential mechanisms of action of IOP lowering for Nyxol are through episcleral venous pressure and increased aqueous flow. At this time, Ocuphire is only planning to evaluate Nyxol as a second-line add-on to standard of care in glaucoma with a partner.
Diabetic Retinopathy (APX3330)
 
Diabetic Retinopathy Overview
 
 Diabetic Retinopathy (“DR”) is an eye disease resulting from diabetes, affecting over 7 million patients in the U.S., in which chronically elevated blood sugar levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. It is the leading cause of vision loss in adults aged 20–74 years. There are two major types of DR:

• | Non-proliferative DR, or NPDR. NPDR is an earlier, more typical stage of DR and can progress into more severe forms of DR over time if untreated and if exposure to elevated blood sugar levels persists. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proliferative DR, or PDR. PDR is a more advanced stage of DR than NPDR. It is characterized by retinal neovascularization and, if left untreated, leads to permanent damage and blindness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Therapies for NPDR and PDR are distinct. For NPDR, treatment is usually directed at observation, lifestyle changes, and control of elevated blood sugars that led to progression of NPDR in the first place. On the other hand, PDR has historically been treated with laser therapy but, more recently, use of anti-VEGF therapies has emerged as a complementary first-line treatment for PDR. In the Protocol S trial by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, Lucentis was found to be noninferior to laser therapy in patients with PDR. Moreover, in 2018, from Regeneron’s PANORAMA trial, EYLEA® reversed disease progression in patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR.
 
Diabetic Macular Edema (APX3330)
 
Diabetic Macular Edema Overview
 
 Diabetic Macular Edema (“DME”) is a complication of DR where the macula swells with fluid leaked from damaged blood vessels as a result of worsening diabetic retinopathy. It is one of the most common reasons for blindness in diabetics, affecting approximately 750,000 patients. DME may cause blurriness in the center of vision, the appearance of straight lines as wavy, colors that look dull or washed out, or blind spots. The pathogenesis of DME involves vascular leakage, retinal ischemia, and release of vasoproliferative growth factors and inflammatory mediators.
 
 15
 
 
In DME, corticosteroids and anti-VEGF agents are used to treat vascular leakage, inflammation and hypoxia/angiogenesis. In patients whose disease has progressed to DR with DME, anti-VEGF agents are first line therapy followed by corticosteroids. Lucentis was approved for treatment of DME with a dosing regimen of a 0.3 mg injection approximately every four weeks. Similarly, EYLEA® was approved with a dosing regimen of a 2.0 mg injection approximately every four weeks.
 
Limitations of Existing Treatments for DR and DME
 
In DR (especially NPDR), despite the approvals of anti-VEGF therapeutics in recent years, the use of injectables is not adopted in practice as preferred treatment as the disease is asymptomatic and patients are reluctant to undergo injections or laser therapy.
 
In DME and late-stage DR, intravitreal VEGF inhibitors are approved globally, however these therapies rarely provide a complete solution to the underlying vascular problem associated with DR and DME. Although these therapeutic agents have been successful for some patients, significant proportions of patients are resistant and refractory. Moreover, serious side effects including hemorrhage and intraocular infections are possible with intravitreal injections. Both Lucentis and EYLEA are also associated with increased risks of blood clots in the arteries. In addition, intravitreal injections require frequent visits to the ophthalmologist, usually on the order of every 4 weeks with a few anti-VEGF therapies in development that are working on increasing the time between injections (8 – 12 weeks).
 
APX3330 Opportunity in DR and DME
 
 Anti-VEGF therapies block the activity of VEGF, but in chronic diseases such as DR and DME, an agent that prevents the production of VEGF poses a large opportunity to improve patient outcomes. Moreover, recent reports in scientific literature demonstrate that diabetic eye disease has an inflammatory component, unrelated to VEGF’s actions. Because inflammation and hypoxic signaling (VEGF production) play crucial roles in both vascular leakage and neovascularization of DR and DME, treatments that impinge upon both pro-inflammatory and hypoxic signaling offer a promising therapeutic strategy. APX3330’s target of Ref-1 may leverage this dual mechanism to reduce the production and hence the quantity of VEGF and prevent inflammatory damage. This potentially allows for improved response to treatment and may extend the duration between invasive treatments for late-stage retinal diseases (DME, wAMD). Moreover, as a potential first-in-class, orally administered product candidate twice a day, it has the potential to be a more convenient option at an earlier stage of disease especially for DR than intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, which are burdensome to patients and have a significant side effect profile including cataract formation, increased intraocular pressure, intraocular infections, and retinal detachments. In clinical trials, APX3330 has been demonstrated to be tolerable with no serious adverse effects (“SAEs”) and no significant acute neurologic, cardiovascular, liver or pulmonary events.
 
Other Indications: wAMD (APX3330)
 
Age-Related Macular Degeneration (“AMD”) is a common eye condition affecting 11 million individuals in the U.S. and 170 million globally, mostly over the age of 55 years. It is a progressive disease affecting the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, which is the region of the eye responsible for sharpness, central vision and color perception. wAMD is an advanced form of AMD characterized by neovascularization and fluid leakage under the retina. It is the leading cause of severe vision loss in patients over the age of 50 in the United States and EU. While wAMD represents only 10% of the number of cases of AMD overall, it is responsible for 90% of AMD-related severe vision loss. Untreated or undertreated wAMD results in further blood vessel leakage, fluid in the macula, and ultimately scar tissue formation, which can lead to permanent vision loss or even blindness as a result of the scarring and retinal deformation that occur during periods of non-treatment or undertreatment. Similar to severe DR and DME, current therapy for wAMD consists of intravitreal injections, mainly of Lucentis and EYLEA. The limitations of these therapies are described in the section above titled, “Limitations of Existing Treatment for DR and DME”. Based on APX3330 targeting Ref-1 and reduction of VEGF production, it has potential use in wAMD. Further, to enter the wAMD injectable market, Ocuphire is considering the utility of an intravitreal formulation of APX2009, a second-generation product candidate analog of APX3330. APX2009 data suggest improved efficacy against the Ref-1 target compared to APX3330 (as published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics).

Ocuphire’s Product Candidates
 
Nyxol
 
Ocuphire’s lead product candidate, Nyxol, is a once-daily, eye drop formulation of phentolamine mesylate designed to reduce pupil diameter and improve visual acuity. The active pharmaceutical ingredient of Nyxol, phentolamine mesylate, is a non-selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist that inhibits activation of the smooth muscle of the iris, reducing pupil diameter. Nyxol shares many of the attributes of existing ophthalmic eyedrops, including a convenient route of administration and cost-effective manufacturing process, with the potential advantage of once-daily dosing (FIGURE 1).
 
In multiple Phase 2 trials, 1% Nyxol was selected as the experimental dose given that in early Phase 2 trials, 1% Nyxol was shown to reduce pupil size, improve near and distance visual acuity in light and dark conditions, and improve low contrast visual acuity. Ocuphire is pursuing multiple indications for 1% Nyxol, including NVD, RM, and presbyopia. For treatment of presbyopia and subsequent improvement in visual acuity, Ocuphire is evaluating the efficacy of a kit combination consisting of 1% Nyxol and low-dose pilocarpine eye drops.
 
Ocuphire initiated three late-stage clinical trials for Nyxol, including a Phase 3 NVD trial and a phase 3 RM trial in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a Phase 2 trial evaluating the combination of 1% Nyxol and low dose pilocarpine for presbyopia in the first quarter of 2021. Ocuphire expects top-line results from the Nyxol trials to read out beginning in the first quarter of 2021 and continuing through the end of the third quarter of 2021.
 
FIGURE 1. Nyxol Product Candidate Profile
 

Mechanism of Action
 
Phentolamine is a nonselective alpha-1 & alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist. Dilation of the pupil is controlled by the radial iris dilator muscles surrounding the pupil which are activated by the alpha-1 receptors of the adrenergic nervous system. Alpha-1 antagonists bind to the receptors to inhibit the pupillary response and reduce dilation (FIGURE 2). Phentolamine mesylate is the active ingredient in two injectable FDA-approved drugs, REGITINE and OraVerse, as described above.
 
 17
 
 
Regarding NVD, it is proposed that a moderate miotic effect by application of Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution (Nyxol) might mitigate night vision complaints. A large portion of NVDs are caused by imperfections or aberrations present on the periphery of the cornea. Therefore, the effects can be reduced or eliminated by reducing the pupil size to a smaller diameter where the smaller pupil blocks unfocused, aberrant rays of light. For RM, pharmacologically induced mydriasis is achieved either by stimulating the iris dilator muscle with the use of alpha agonists (e.g., phenylephrine), or by blocking the iris sphincter muscle with the use of muscarinic antagonists (e.g., tropicamide). Nyxol, either by directly antagonizing the alpha-1 agonist or by indirectly antagonizing the pupil dilation effect of muscarinic blocking, may expedite the reversal of mydriasis prior to natural reversal. Lastly, for presbyopic patients, to overcome the lens’ inability to change shape (accommodation) and focus light from near objects, pupil diameter reduction to a small size will allow light to come in the eye only in a near straight direction and increase the depth of focus (the “pinhole effect”). Ocuphire believes that it is possible to reach a target 1.6 mm – 2.0 mm “pinhole” pupil diameter by relaxing the dilator iris muscle with Nyxol and contracting the iris sphincter muscle with a muscarinic agonist such as a low dose pilocarpine. This could result in an optimal depth of focus and near vision clarity without the assistance of lenticular accommodation.
 
FIGURE 2. Nyxol’s Proposed Mechanism of Action
 

Nyxol Clinical Experience Summary
 
Nyxol has been assessed in seven investigator-initiated and sponsored Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Across all trials, 168 of 232 adult patients were exposed to at least one dose of phentolamine mesylate ophthalmic solution. All Phase 2 trials have been accepted for poster or oral presentation at the annual American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), or American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) meetings.
 
Ocuphire believes that results from Nyxol’s Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials supports its current development plan focused on NVD, RM, and presbyopia patients. Specifically, patients treated with Nyxol were observed to have statistically significant decreases in pupil diameter and improved visual acuity. Results from the trials are summarized below:
 

• | In a double-masked, randomized, single dose, 3-arm controlled, parallel design Phase 1 trial (OP-NYX-001, IND 67-288), 45 healthy volunteers were administered a single dose of 0.2% Nyxol with or without tetrahydrozoline or tetrahydrozoline alone. Both Nyxol-treated groups showed a statistically significant reduction in pupil diameter (PD) compared to tetrahydrozoline alone. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a 12-day, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, incomplete block, 3-period crossover, dose escalation Phase 1 trial in 16 healthy volunteers (OP-NYX-002, IND 67-288), there was a dose-related response in improvement in LCVA relative to placebo. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 18
 
 

• | In a 2-week, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, incomplete block 3-period crossover, dose escalation Phase 1/2 trial in 16 patients with NVD (OP-NYX-004, IND 73-987), Nyxol was well-tolerated with no severe adverse events (SAEs). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a 1-day, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose Phase 2 trial in 24 patients with severe NVD (OP-NYX-SNV, IND 70-736), patients treated with Nyxol exhibited greater reductions in pupil diameter and greater improvements in low contrast visual acuity compared to those on placebo. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a 15-day, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 3-arm (0, 0.5%, and 1% Nyxol) Phase 2 trial in 60 patients with severe NVD (OP-NYX-01a2, IND 70499), improvements in contrast sensitivity frequencies and VA, as well as reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) and pupil diameter, were observed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a 14-day, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, multi-center Phase 2b trial in 39 patients with elevated intraocular pressure (ORION-1, IND 070499), patients treated with 1% Nyxol showed statistically significant reduction in PD and improvement in near visual acuity relative to placebo, with evening bedtime daily dosing regimen. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-dose, multi-center Phase 2b trial with 32 healthy patients (MIRA-1, IND 070499) to study reversal of pharmacologically induced mydriasis, healthy patients treated with 1% Nyxol had statistically significantly greater reductions in PD at multiple time points compared to placebo, and more patients in the study group returned to baseline PD at 2 hours compared to the placebo group.

A summary of Ocuphire’s completed clinical trials is shown below (TABLE 2). Note that Nyxol in its current proprietary formulation of phentolamine mesylate ophthalmic solution was first introduced in the NYX-01a2 trial, and prior to that, a formulation of phentolamine mesylate in artificial tears solution was used

Nyxol was observed to be well-tolerated at single doses up to and including 1.0% daily in each eye. This includes 59 patients who received multiple doses of up to 1% Nyxol for at least 14 days. Safety of the patients in these trials was evaluated by AE monitoring, physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, no healthy volunteers or patients reported a treatment-emergent SAE. No deaths occurred in any of the trials. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate. AEs reported were mild to moderate in intensity with the most common being transient conjunctival hyperemia and ocular irritation; however, Nyxol dosing at or near bedtime was observed to mitigate or minimize these side effects during the daytime.
 
Based on the results of these trials, Ocuphire believes Nyxol has the potential to have a differentiated profile as a convenient, well-tolerated first-line or adjunct therapy.
 
Nyxol Phase 2 Clinical Trials
 
Nyxol Phase 2b Trial in Elderly Patients with Elevated Intraocular Pressure (ORION-1)
 
ORION-1 (NYXG-201) was a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of 1% Nyxol compared with placebo ophthalmic solution for 14 days in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, many of whom were also presbyopic. After screening was performed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 39 elderly patients (median age of 63) were randomized into the trial (Nyxol arm, n = 19; placebo arm, n = 20). These patients were either treatment-naïve or were previously taking intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medication and were washed out for 30 days prior to dosing. Patients took their study medication (Nyxol or placebo) in both eyes between 8PM to 10PM every evening for 14 days. Assessments were made on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 16. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in mean diurnal IOP at Day 15 from baseline. Mean diurnal IOP is the mean of the IOP measurements at three timepoints (8AM, 10AM, 4PM). Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in pupil diameter (PD), change in distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), and change in best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), as well as additional IOP analyses. Safety assessments included measurements of conjunctival redness (using the Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit (CCLRU) grading 4-point scale (0-3)), adverse events (AE), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), concomitant medications, and pregnancy. Highlights of this trial were presented at the 2020 annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) by Dr. Jay Pepose via video recording. The findings of this trial were also recently published in January 2021 in Clinical Ophthalmology, an international, peer-reviewed, open access journal.
 
Efficacy
 
FDA’s evidentiary standards for drug approval for an IOP-lowering indication require the proposed drug product to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction of diurnal IOP compared to control. In the ORION-1 trial, the primary endpoint for change in diurnal IOP was not met with statistical significance. Rather, key prespecified secondary endpoints for other indications such as NVD and Presbyopia were successfully met with evening daily dosing of 1% Nyxol eye drops, including PD reduction and visual acuity performance. Based on the May 2020 FDA End of Phase 2 (“EOP2”) meeting, the primary endpoints to meet the evidentiary standards for the FDA for the first Phase 3 NVD registration trial and Phase 2 Presbyopia trial are described in the “Planned Nyxol Trials” section.
IOP
 
The primary endpoint of mean change in diurnal IOP from baseline in the study eye at Day 15 was not statistically significant between the Nyxol and placebo arms (-2.30 mmHg vs 2.18 mmHg, respectively, p=0.894). In a post-hoc analysis of all eyes of patients where either eye met the baseline IOP category of < 24 mmHg, the mean change in diurnal IOP from baseline at Day 8 was -2.46 mmHg in the Nyxol arm and 0.90 mmHg in the placebo arm, which was a statistically significant difference favoring the Nyxol arm (p=0.0489); the sample size in this analysis was n=9 in the Nyxol arm and n=8 in the placebo arm. This post-hoc analysis informs future trials targeted to patients with uncontrolled and lower IOP even with treatment or normotensive glaucoma patients. Ocuphire is considering working with a development partner to evaluate Nyxol as a second-line add-on to standard of care therapy in lowering IOP for patients with baseline IOP from 16 to 24 mmHg.

Pupil Diameter
 
Statistically significant mean ~20% (~1 mm) PD reduction from baseline in the Nyxol arm as compared to the placebo arm was observed at all timepoints tested for study eye in both photopic and mesopic conditions that was sustained over 24 hours with bedtime daily dosing (p≤0.0003), as measured for a prespecified secondary endpoint. Under photopic conditions, change from baseline was statistically significant favoring the Nyxol arm vs placebo at every time point, for example on Day 15 (-0.77 mm vs -0.01 mm, p<0.0001) (FIGURE 3). Similarly, under mesopic conditions, change from baseline was statistically significant favoring the Nyxol arm vs placebo at every time point, for example at Day 15 (-1.00mm vs -0.05 mm, p<0.0001) (TABLE 3). Further, on Day 15, a statistically significant number of patients favoring the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm achieved ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, ≥ 20%, and ≥ 30% reduction from baseline in study eye under both mesopic and photopic conditions, including one-third of patients in the Nyxol arm (vs none in the placebo arm) who achieved ≥ 30% PD reduction (FIGURE 4).

Distance-Corrected Near Visual Acuity
 
Visual acuity was measured using logMAR (Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution), a numerical method where 1 line on a standard visual chart = 0.1 logMAR and 1 letter = 0.02. A statistically significant percent of patients favoring the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm in the study eye under photopic and mesopic conditions achieved ≥ 1 line DCNVA improvement at one or more timepoints (photopic Day 15: 63% vs 20%, p=0.026; mesopic Day 15: 58% vs 15%, p=0.014), as measured for a prespecified secondary endpoint (FIGURE 5). In a post-hoc analysis of all eyes under mesopic and photopic conditions that were categorized as having severe presbyopia with DCNVA ≥ 0.3 logMAR at baseline, a statistically significant percent of patients favoring the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm achieved ≥ 2 lines DCNVA improvement under photopic conditions in the best eye at Day 16 (72.7% vs 15.4%; p=0.0049). In the study eye under photopic and mesopic conditions, a statistically significant difference in least-squares (LS) mean DCNVA improvement favoring the Nyxol arm vs. placebo of approximately 1 line (-0.1 logMAR) was also observed at all timepoints (i.e. Day 15 photopic: -0.09 logMAR, p=0.015; and Day 15 mesopic: -0.10 logMAR, p= 0.0016).
 
These secondary and post-hoc analyses inform future trials for Presbyopia, for which the approvable evidentiary FDA primary endpoint is percent of subjects with ≥3 lines of improvement in binocular distance-corrected near visual acuity without loss in distance vision. Ocuphire anticipates that the addition of low dose pilocarpine to 1% Nyxol in a kit may increase depth of field by further constricting pupil size to 1.6 – 2mm to achieve a “pinhole” effect, resulting in 3 lines near vision improvement as consistently demonstrated by others pharmacological and device approaches creating the ‘pinhole’ effect.

In all eyes under photopic conditions, a statistically significant percent of patients favoring the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm achieved ≥ 1 line improvement in BCDVA from baseline in the best eye compared with the placebo arm at Day 8 (63.2% vs 35.0%; p = 0.0310).
Safety
 
Nyxol 1% was well tolerated and there were no major ocular or systemic safety issues. An evening dose regimen minimized eye redness during the daytime while benefiting near visual acuity in an elderly population. The incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs was higher in the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm (31.6% vs 5.0%) but all TEAEs were mild in severity, with no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to withdrawal or study medication discontinuation (TABLE 4). Most TEAEs were considered related to study medication. Although conjunctival redness scores increased in the Nyxol arm at Day 8, Day 15, and Day 16, the scores in the Nyxol arm at any post-baseline timepoint did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from scores in the placebo arm. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs and HRs were relatively unchanged and remained within normal range throughout the duration of the trial and were similar between arms. Neither biomicroscopic nor ophthalmoscopic examination showed any clinically significant abnormalities at Screening or at Day 15. There was no worsening of distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, or IOP.

Nyxol Phase 2b Trial in Healthy Patients to Reverse Pharmacologically Induced Mydriasis (MIRA-1)
 
MIRA-1 (NYXRM-201) was a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, cross-over trial of Nyxol compared with vehicle (placebo) ophthalmic solution in normal healthy patients. Thirty-two patients (median age of 27) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (placebo at Visit 1 followed by 1% Nyxol at Visit 2 or 1% Nyxol at Visit 1 followed by placebo at Visit 2). Patients received the same mydriatic agent (either 2.5% phenylephrine or 1% tropicamide) in both Visit 1 and a week later at Visit 2, in both eyes. The study medication was administered 1 hour later (Time 0 minutes), and measurements were taken at 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours. The primary efficacy endpoint for this reversal of RM trial was a change in mean pupil diameter (PD) at 2 hours post-treatment. Ophthalmic secondary efficacy endpoints included percent of subjects returning to baseline pupil diameter, assessments included pupil diameter (PD), percent of subjects with unchanged accommodation, change in best-corrected distant visual acuity (BCDVA), and change in distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), and accommodation. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed by mydriatic agent at various timepoints. Safety assessments included heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and conjunctival redness. One week later, patients returned for Visit 2 and were crossed over. 31 out of 32 healthy patients completed the study. Highlights of this trial were presented at the 2020 annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) by Dr. Paul Karpecki via video submission. The findings of this trial were also recently published in February 2021 in Optometry and Visual Science, the international, peer-reviewed journal of the American Academy of Optometry.
 
 25
 
 
Efficacy
 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial, the change in mean pupil diameter at 2 hours post-treatment, was met with a statistically significant result. In addition, key prespecified secondary endpoints with Nyxol to treat mydriasis were successfully met, including percent of subjects returning to within 0.5 mm of baseline PD and percent of subjects returning to baseline accommodation. Based on the May 2020 FDA EOP2 meeting, the FDA clarified that to demonstrate efficacy for the RM indication, the agency expects a statistically significant difference in the number of patients who have a PD that returns to within 0.2 millimeters of baseline (vs. 0.5 mm). The FDA indicated that a 90-minute primary endpoint may be acceptable, and 60 minutes should also be evaluated. The proposed trial design for the first Phase 3 RM registration trial is described in the “Planned Nyxol Trials” section.
Pupil Diameter
 
Nyxol treatment demonstrated a statistically significant ability to expedite reversal of mydriasis in the study eye as measured by mean change in PD from baseline at 2 hours, compared with placebo treatment (-1.69 mm vs -0.69 mm, p<0.0001) (FIGURE 6). A statistically significant difference favoring Nyxol treatment was also observed at all time points tested from 1 hour through 6 hours in the study eye and non-study eye. These statistically significant differences were maintained when analyzed separately by the mydriatic agents, 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide.
 
FIGURE 6. Least-Squares Mean ± SE of Pupil Diameter in the Study Eye by Timepoint Overall (Left) and by Mydriatic Agent 2.5% Phenylephrine or 1% Tropicamide (Right) (MIRA-1)
 

In a post-hoc analysis of the agreed Phase 3 endpoint of a PD threshold of ≤ 0.2 mm above baseline, a statistically significant percent of patients favoring the Nyxol treatment compared with the placebo treatment had study eyes that showed reversal of mydriasis at 2 hours (29% vs. 13%, p=0.0262) and 4 hours (68% vs. 23%, p=0<0.0001), with a trend towards significance at 1 hour (16% vs. 7%, p=0.1094) (FIGURE 7). These significant effects were also seen when stratified by mydriatic agent. In the group treated with phenylephrine, a significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with Nyxol showed reversal of mydriasis at 2 hours (60% vs. 27%, p=0.015) and 4 hours (80% vs. 33%, p=0.0049). In the group treated with tropicamide, reversal of mydriasis takes longer as expected, but a significantly larger proportion of subjects treated with Nyxol showed reversal of mydriasis at 4 hours (56% vs. 13%, p<0.0001). The purpose of these post-hoc analyses were to confirm the FDA approvable endpoint for the timepoints measured in MIRA-1, which helped inform the Phase 3 trial design for the RM indication.
 
 26
 
 
FIGURE 7. Percent of Subjects Achieving Study Eye Pupil Diameter No More Than 0.2 mm Above Baseline by Timepoint Across Mydriatic Agents (MIRA-1)
 

In a post-hoc analysis to supplement Ocuphire’s commercial strategy, a statistically significant time savings of 2 hours was observed for patients to achieve reversal of mydriasis with Nyxol treatment vs. placebo treatment using a PD threshold of ≤ 0 mm above baseline (p < 0.001). The placebo outcomes demonstrate that natural reversal of mydriasis takes longer with tropicamide than with phenylephrine. Nyxol was effective at inducing reversal of mydriasis with both mydriatic agents.
Visual Accommodation
 
In this trial, a statistically significant worsening in accommodation within groups from baseline (-1 hour) to 0 minutes (max PD timepoint) was observed only in patients who were treated with tropicamide. This outcome is expected as tropicamide is a muscarinic antagonist that elicits cycloplegia, or paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye, resulting in a loss of accommodation. When patients treated with tropicamide were analyzed, a statistically significant percent of patients favoring the Nyxol treatment compared with the placebo treatment had unchanged accommodation from baseline in both eyes at 2 hours (63% vs 28%, p=.0084) (FIGURE 8). Unchanged accommodation from baseline (-1 hour) is defined as a change from baseline value ≥ -1 diopters, a measure of the eye’s ability to adjust incoming light and sharply focus it on the retina.
 
 27
 
 
FIGURE 8. Percent of Patients with Unchanged Accommodation from Baseline in Both Eyes Receiving 1% Tropicamide by Timepoint (MIRA-1)
 

Safety
 
When treated with Nyxol, 36% of patients experienced eye disorder TEAEs (all mild cases of conjunctival hyperemia), with no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to withdrawal or study medication discontinuation. No other TEAEs were observed with Nyxol treatment. Nyxol was associated with mild-to-moderate conjunctival hyperemia in the majority of eyes. This hyperemia peaked at 30 minutes and declined steadily thereafter from 4 to 6 hours. It should be noted that no patients requested to use LUMIFY (brimonidine) at 2 hours to reduce any signs or symptoms of redness. The majority of patients did not report ocular discomfort at the time of instillation of either Nyxol or placebo. Any discomfort that occurred was mild in intensity. There was no clinically meaningful change in IOP from baseline between eyes treated with Nyxol and eyes treated with placebo. No patients with either Nyxol treatment or placebo treatment had a ≥ 3-line worsening in BCDVA or DCNVA at any time point in either eye.
 
Nyxol Phase 2 Trial in Patients with Severe NVD – NYX-SNV
 
NYX-SNV was a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial assessing the tolerability and effect of a single topical drop of 1.0% solution of phentolamine mesylate in Tears Naturale II in each eye or Tears Naturale II (placebo) on pupil diameter (PD), contrast sensitivity (CS), visual acuity (VA), and wavefront aberrometry (WA). A total of 24 patients (median age of 39) with severe night vision complains were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment groups (active treatment, n = 16; placebo control, n = 8). Patients had to demonstrate at least a 2-line improvement in LCVA in dim light during illumination of the contralateral eye at screening. Each group was treated with one drop of test article in each eye. The primary endpoint was a statistically significant improvement in the mean change in monocular contrast sensitivity scores under mesopic conditions at each of five spatial frequencies. Key secondary endpoints included measurements of LCVA under mesopic and photopic conditions, change in PD, and percent of subjects with an improvement in CS (at multiple frequencies), and which were recorded at baseline (prior to treatment administration) and approximately 2 hours after administration. Safety assessments included measurements of patient heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), intraocular pressure (IOP), and eye redness. Highlights of this trial were presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (McDonald et al., 2010) and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (McDonald et al., 2011).
 
 28
 
 
Efficacy
 
The original exploratory primary endpoint for NVD was the mean change in contrast sensitivity under mesopic conditions at each of five spatial frequencies (continuous analysis). This endpoint was not met, although mean change was statistically significant at three out of five CS frequencies. Statistically significant changes were also found in key secondary endpoints including LCVA (mesopic and photopic), change in PD, reduction in aberration errors (errors that affect light transmission in specific pupil diameter sizes), and percent of subjects with an improvement in CS in three out of five frequencies. In a subsequent 2012 Type C meeting, a categorical analysis of percent of subjects with 50% improvement at three contiguous CS frequencies (e.g., 6 cpd, 12 cpd, 18 cpd) at two timepoints was under consideration as a potential primary endpoint for NVD. However, in the May 2020 FDA EOP2 meeting, the FDA acknowledged Ocuphire’s plan for a more standardized primary endpoint, LCVA, at a single timepoint of either 7 or 14 days.
 
Key secondary endpoints with 1% Nyxol demonstrated statistically significant reductions in PD and improvement in LCVA in photopic and mesopic lighting conditions, as well as individual CS frequency improvements. Treatment with 1% Nyxol further exhibited a statistically significant reduction in aberration errors (errors that affect light transmission in specific pupil diameter sizes). The proposed trial design for the first Phase 3 NVD registration trial is described in the “Planned Nyxol Trials” section. The results for this trial are shown in order of relevance for the planned NVD Phase 3 endpoints.
 
Low Contrast and High Contrast (Distance) Visual Acuity
 
For NVD, the planned FDA primary endpoint is percent of subjects with 3 lines of improvement in mesopic low contrast best-corrected distance visual acuity at a single timepoint. In this trial, even with small sample size, there was a positive trend of 3-line (15-letter or greater) improvement in mesopic low contrast distance visual acuity (MLCVA) (19% Nyxol versus 0% for placebo, p = 0.16) and photopic low contrast distance visual acuity (PLCVA) (19% Nyxol versus 0% for placebo, p = 0.16). Additionally, greater fractions of Nyxol-treated eyes registered a 1-line (5-letter or greater) improvement in MLCVA (69% versus 31% for placebo, p = 0.029) and PLCVA (63% versus 13% for placebo, p = 0.017), as well as a 2-line (10-letter or greater) improvement in MLCVA (34% versus 6% for placebo, p < 0.03) and PLCVA (28% versus 0% for placebo, p < 0.02); (FIGURE 9).
 
Other distance VA measurements were made including mesopic distance high contrast visual acuity (MDHCVA) and photopic distance high contrast visual acuity (PDHCVA). Greater fractions of Nyxol-treated eyes registered a 2-line (10-letter or greater) statistically significant improvement in MDHCVA (25% versus 0% for placebo, p < 0.03), with a notable but not statistically significant trend in PDHCVA (19% versus 0% for placebo, p = NS). Differences in mean change in VA between treatments were also seen. There were statistically significant improvements with 1% Nyxol from pre- treatment across all mean VA measurements (p < 0.0001). Further, mean MLCVA showed statistically significant improvement for both treatment groups 2−3 hours post treatment, with the mean magnitude of improvement for phentolamine mesylate patients being over twice that of placebo patients (8.0 versus 3.1 letters, respectively; p = 0.035).

FIGURE 9. Percent of Eyes with 1, 2, and 3 or More Lines of Improvement in Mesopic Low Contrast Visual Acuity (left) and Photopic Low Contrast Visual Acuity (right) (NYX-SNV)
 

Pupil Diameter
 
Mean PD decreased at a statistically significant amount of an average of 1.3 mm (p < 0.0001), or ~20%, for phentolamine mesylate treated patients, whereas mean PD of placebo patients did not significantly change between pre-treatment and post-treatment. The difference in mean change between treatment groups was also statistically significant (1.1 mm, p < 0.0001) (TABLE 3). In a post-hoc analysis that helped inform the Phase 3 trial design, there was an average of ~1.5 mm pupil diameter reduction in patients with baselines above 6mm, compared to ~1 mm reduction in patients with baselines below 6 mm. Measurements were taken 2−3 hours after dosing.
Wavefront Aberrations (WA)
 
Total wavefront RMS (root-mean square) error is the summation of all aberrations measured with a wavefront device (VISX-CustomVue Aberrometer), delineated in µm (microns), RMS error for short. Higher order RMS error is the summation of higher order aberrations including trefoil, coma, and spherical aberrations that because of their complex nature cannot be corrected with regular corrective lenses. Reduction in higher “errors” would be consistent with improvements in NVD vision. In a post-hoc analysis with the purposes to help inform future trials and commercial efforts, the difference in change between Nyxol and placebo treatment arms for both total RMS (0.42 µm, p=0.0004) and higher order RMS (0.17 μm, p<0.0001) were statistically significant, with Nyxol treated eyes showing improvement with a larger reduction in error (FIGURE 10).

Contrast Sensitivity (CS) Frequencies
 
Contrast sensitivity refers to a measure of how much contrast (shade of gray over white background) a person requires to see a target. The number of light-dark cycles of the grating that subtend 1 deg visual angle is a measure of the spatial frequency of the grating, expressed in cycles per degree (cpd). The primary endpoint, change in contrast sensitivity under mesopic conditions at each of five spatial frequencies (continuous analysis), was not achieved. The difference in mean changes in contrast sensitivity was statistically significant in favor of phentolamine mesylate treated subjects at 6 cycles per degree (1.3 patches; p =0.0196), 12 cycles per degree (1.3 patches; p = 0.0155), and 18 cycles per degree (1.0 patches; p= 0.0392). On a prespecified endpoint of CS improvement, the incidence of eyes experiencing a two-patch (equivalent to 50% or .3 log improvement) or greater improvement in CS with glare was greater in the phentolamine mesylate treatment group vs. placebo at two out of five frequencies, 12 cpd (50.0% versus 12.5%, p < 0.010), and 18 cpd (31.3% versus 6.3%, p < 0.046).
Safety
 
No serious adverse events or other adverse events were reported during the trial. Overall, study treatment appeared to be well-tolerated. No meaningful differences in mean HR or mean systolic and diastolic BP between treatment groups were observed. Treatment with phentolamine mesylate caused a statistically significant elevation in mean change from baseline in eye redness between the 2 treatment groups (+38.6 mm versus +12.1 mm for placebo; p < 0.0004; 0 mm = no redness, 100 mm = maximal redness). The mean change in IOP of phentolamine mesylate treated eyes from screening to 2−3 hours post-treatment (-1.8 mmHg) was statistically significant (p < 0.0004).
Nyxol Phase 2 Trial in Patients with Severe NVD – NYX-01a2
 
NYX-01a2 was a 15-day, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with severe NVD. Following the 15-day double masked period (Study Period 1), all patients were given 6 additional doses of 1% Nyxol to be taken as needed, with a follow-up study visit on Day 32 (Study Period 2). Sixty people (median age of 35.5) with subjective complaints of severe NVD were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups of 20 patients who each received placebo (vehicle control), 0.5% Nyxol, or 1% Nyxol one drop in each eye, once daily. All treatments were administered to both eyes. Patients had to demonstrate a 0.3 log (50%) improvement from baseline in CS at any 2 of 5 spatial frequencies (1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree) in at least 1 eye during illumination of the contralateral eye, under mesopic room illumination with glare. This contrast sensitivity (CS) measurement of 50% improvement from baseline in any 2 of 5 frequencies was the primary endpoint. Key secondary endpoints included measurements of pupil diameter (PD), LCVA. Safety measurements include eye redness, intraocular pressure (IOP), BP, and HR. Measurements were taken predose and postdose (2 hours after dosing) on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 32 and were compared to baseline. Highlights of this trial were presented as a podium oral presentation at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (Holladay et al, 2018).
Efficacy
 
As mentioned in the SNV trial, prior to the FDA EOP2 meeting, the percent of subjects with 50% improvement at three contiguous CS frequencies (e.g., 6 cpd, 12 cpd, 18 cpd) (categorical analysis) was under consideration as a potential primary endpoint for NVD. As stated above, a categorical analysis of the percent of patients with ≥ 3 lines of improvement in mesopic LCVA at 7 days is Ocuphire’s planned primary endpoint for the two registration NVD Phase 3 trials.
 
The NYX-01a2 trial did not meet the primary endpoint at Day 15. However, statistically significant results for CS improvements in 6-12-18 cpd were observed at Day 8. The trial did demonstrate a dose response favoring 1% Nyxol. Further, statistically significant reductions in pupil diameter, trends in improvement in low contrast visual acuity in bright and dim lighting conditions were shown. Durability of effect on PD was observed 24 hours later for Nyxol with daily morning doses. The proposed trial design for the Phase 3 NVD registration trial(s) is described in the “Planned Nyxol Trials” section.
 
 31
 
 
Pupil Diameter
 
Treatment with either 0.5% or 1% Nyxol resulted in a consistent and statistically significant reduction of PD from Day 1 predose at both Day 8 and Day 15 pre and postdose compared to placebo (p ≤ 0.0008). There was evidence of dose proportionality with eyes receiving 1% Nyxol having a lower mean PD than those receiving
 
0.5% Nyxol. In a post-hoc analysis, which informs future trial dosing regimen, the mean predose PD in the 1% Nyxol group sustained a statistically significant reduction from Day 1 predose (~15%) compared to placebo up to Day 15 (p < 0.001) (TABLE 3). Nyxol demonstrated 24-hour effects which suggested the potential to be a chronic use product.
 
Mesopic Low Contrast (Best-Corrected Distance) Visual Acuity (LCVA)
 
In a post-hoc analysis, a statistically significant gradual improvement was seen in mesopic LCVA in all treated eyes with 65% of eyes receiving 1% Nyxol showing at least 1 line of improvement compared to 35% of eyes receiving Placebo on Day 15 (p = 0.02). This post-hoc analysis informs future trials targeted to patients with at least 3 lines of mesopic LCVA deficit, and are supportive of the pre-specified LCVA results from SNV.
Contrast Sensitivity (CS) Frequencies
 
Contrast sensitivity measurements were taken before dosing on Days 1, 4, 8, and 15. By Day 8, the percent of eyes with a 50% CS improvement predose in the 1.0% treatment arm was statistically significantly higher than both predose on Day 1 (p = .0103 by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test of proportions) as well as Placebo on Day 8 (p = .0269). There was numerical evidence of dose proportionality, with more eyes receiving 1% Nyxol having a higher mean CS than those receiving 0.5% Nyxol.
Safety
 
Overall, multiple doses of up to 1% Nyxol appeared well tolerated in patients with severe night vision complaints, with no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs. There were no deaths or SAEs in this trial and no patients were discontinued due to AEs. Overall, 50 (83%) patients experienced a total of 179 TEAEs during the trial, of which 173 were mild in severity and 6 were moderate (including headaches, blurred vision, event of postural dizziness, eye irritation).
 
Following active treatments, the majority of postdose (2 to 3 hours after dose) eye redness through Day 15 was moderate, with a higher percentage following 1.0% than 0.5% Nyxol. Eye redness returned to predose baseline by the next study visit, suggesting that once daily dosing prior to bedtime may result in pupil effects with little or no redness during the waking hours of the day. Changes in lens opacity, cornea staining erosion, and palpebral edema were minimal following all treatments. There were no abnormal findings in bulbar edema, cornea edema erosion, anterior chamber cells, and anterior chamber flare. There was a trend towards a greater mean improvement in high contrast distance VA in eyes treated with Nyxol than in those treated with placebo.
 
Eye Redness
 
Eye redness was experienced by all subjects, including placebo subjects. Postdose, the majority of active treatment patients exhibited an increase in eye redness. For example, on Day 15 the 1% Nyxol mean eye redness was statistically different from placebo (1.98 (mild-moderate) vs 0.71 (none-mild); p<0.0001). Predose eye redness on Days 4, 8, and 15, returned to Day 1 predose baseline, less than 20 hours postdose from the previous day.
Intraocular Pressure
 
Both the mean absolute IOP and mean change in IOP post treatment showed a statistically significant decrease (2.5 mmHg placebo-adjusted) with 1% Nyxol in one or both eyes with IOP in the normal range (12-22 mmHg) (TABLE 5).

Nyxol Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 
Ocuphire evaluated efficacy and safety of Nyxol in 3 double-masked, randomized Phase 1 trials (NYX-001, 002, and 004) in a total of 77 healthy volunteers. Efficacy was observed in only 2 of these 3 trials given the lack of exclusion of patients that wear contact lenses in NYX-004. In the 2 trials that reported efficacy, Nyxol demonstrated statistically significant decreases in pupil diameter compared to placebo at various doses (0.2%, 0.4%, 0.8% phentolamine mesylate). From a safety perspective, no serious adverse events occurred in any of the 3 trials. There were no effects on heart rate, systolic BP, or diastolic BP that could be attributed to treatment, and these values were not clinically meaningful since all measures remained within normal range at all assessments. However, there was significantly more redness in the patients treated with Nyxol with the greatest differences in redness compared to placebo occurring at 2- and 4-hours post-treatment. Moreover, there was a dose-related response regarding eye redness.
 
Nyxol Non-Drug Trials: NVD Epidemiology (OP-EPI-001)
 
At present, there are no diagnostic codes for NVD. To gain further insight into this indication, Ocuphire conducted an epidemiological trial, OP-EPI-001, to describe the signs and symptoms of NVD and the effect of pupil constriction driven by contralateral illumination on low and high contrast visual acuity. A total of 102 patients completed all study measurements. All patients had a diagnosis that put them at increased risk of NVD, including post-surgery (n = 22), high myopia/astigmatism (n = 21), contact lenses (n = 21), night myopia (n = 20), and cataracts (n = 18). Some patients did not limit night driving but were concerned about their vision when driving at night. Refusal to drive at night was most common among individuals with cataracts, where 4/18 (22%) reported never driving at night. Post refractive surgery patients and patients with night myopia displayed a higher incidence and magnitude of improvement in low contrast visual acuity during pupil constriction when compared to other groups, showing an improvement of 10+ letters change in 48% of pupils and 58% of pupils, respectively. These patients were also the most likely to report that their vision was improved during pupil constriction. For each diagnostic group, a majority of patients reported that at least one of the visual disturbances (halos, glare sensitivity, and starbursts) applied to their night vision problems. In summary, Ocuphire identified 2 population subgroups (post refractive surgery patients and patients with night myopia) that can benefit the most by a reduction in pupil dilation in mesopic conditions. In order to further characterize the prevalence and severity of NVD and the pricing and marketing plans in the U.S. population, Ocuphire has initiated additional market research.

Nyxol Nonclinical Toxicology Studies
 
As part of a comprehensive nonclinical toxicity program, over 8 exploratory and definitive single and repeated-dose toxicity studies of Nyxol were conducted with rabbits and beagle dogs. Nyxol was well tolerated in these completed studies. In the repeated-dose (4 drops a day) 28-day rabbit study, the only findings were subtle, superficial corneal opacities observed in all rabbit study arms but most prominently in the 2% dose (vs 1%, 0.5%, and placebo). There were no Nyxol-related ocular pathology findings. Histopathologic changes at examination were not considered related to Nyxol administration and the animals appeared otherwise healthy.
 
These findings would seem to rule out a substantive toxicologic insult. Based on these results, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 1% Nyxol in animals. Phentolamine mesylate mean T1/2 ranged from 0.833 to 1.36 hours in both sexes. Phentolamine mesylate did not affect embryonic or fetal development in the rabbit at oral doses at least 20 times the recommended dose (based on a 60-kg human). No teratogenic or embryotoxic effects were observed in the rat, mouse, or rabbit studies. In several in vitro tests, phentolamine mesylate has been shown not to be genotoxic. For chronic administration of Nyxol, a 6-month repeated-dose toxicity study with Nyxol in Dutch belted rabbits has been initiated to support the long-term safety exposure trial. With completion of this study, Ocuphire believes it will meet the non-clinical/toxicology obligations for an NDA filing in any chronic indication for Nyxol.
 
APX3330
 
APX3330 (E3330) is a twice a day oral tablet designed to target multiple pathways relevant to retinal and choroidal vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), which if left untreated may result in permanent visual acuity loss and eventual blindness. Data suggest that APX3330 is a promising candidate for clinical evaluation of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of these diseases, beginning with DR. Ocuphire believes APX3330 shares desirable attributes for back of the eye therapies, including broad therapeutic applications, a convenient route of administration and cost-effective manufacturing process, without the need for uncomfortable intravitreal injections (FIGURE 11).
 
In preclinical studies, APX3330 has demonstrated the ability to decrease angiogenesis and inflammation in the retina whether delivered orally, systemically, or directly into the eye via intravitreal injections. In humans, APX3330 was shown to be clinically well-tolerated in multiple Phase 1 and 2 trials with fewer than 10% experiencing mild, self-limiting side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea. In addition, it was shown that significant amounts of oral APX3330 reach the bloodstream concentrations in humans higher than the levels in mice which showed effects in the retina.
 
Ocuphire is initially pursuing a moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR)/mild proliferative retinopathy (PDR) indication, as well as patients with DME without loss of central vision. Ocuphire may pursue other indications with APX3330 including broader DME population and wet AMD. Second-generation candidate, APX2009, may also be considered for intravitreal injections. Ocuphire plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for APX3330 for NPDR/PDR in the first quarter of 2021, with top-line results expected by early 2022.

Proposed Mechanism of Action
 
APX3330 is a highly selective small molecule that acts on the dual-functioning Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1/Redox Effector Factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) protein, referred to as Ref-1. This protein is implicated in both redox signaling and DNA repair. Because APX3330 selectively inhibits the redox function without affecting the molecule’s ability to carry out DNA repair, normal cell function is left intact. Moreover, interference of Ref-1 activity with APX3330 blocks angiogenesis and inflammation by simultaneously decreasing the activity of several important transcription factors such as HIF-1α and NF-κB (FIGURE 12). HIF-1α regulated the expression of VEGF, a protein that is paramount for angiogenesis, and NF-κB is an upstream regulator of proteins involved in inflammatory processes such as TNFα and chemokines.
 
The development of DR/DME involves leakage from retinal vessels, lack of blood flow to the retina, and release of angiogenic growth factors and inflammatory mediators. The downstream targets of HIF-1α and NF-κB serve as key mediators of these disease features and are targets of current therapy for diabetic eye disease and wAMD. Rather than inhibiting the action of VEGF protein, APX3330 has been shown in preclinical models to inhibit its formation; this is a key potential distinction of APX3330 from the drugs currently approved or under development for DR/DME such as Lucentis and EYLEA. APX3330’s potential ability to inhibit the activity of these two transcription factors may mitigate the need for frequent intravitreal anti-VEGF or steroid injections.
 
FIGURE 12: APX3330 Dual Mechanism of Action in Validated Disease Pathways
 

APX3330 has a dual mechanism that decreases both abnormal angiogenesis and inflammation. APX3330 blocks pathways downstream of Ref-1. Blocking HIF-1α reduces VEGF signaling, and blocking NF-kB modulates VEGF, TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokine production. In contrast, anti-VEGF agents solely inhibit the actions of VEGF.
APX3330 Clinical Experience Summary
 
APX3330 has been studied in 346 out of 441 patients participating in multiple Phase 1 and 2 non-ocular clinical trials to explore its safety, effect upon the Ref-1 molecular target, and pharmacodynamic characteristics. Under the sponsorship of Eisai Co., Ltd., 10 clinical trials were conducted involving healthy volunteers in Japan as well as patients with chronic hepatitis diseases (i.e., Type C, B, alcohol-induced) with the intent of developing a TNF-α blocking agent. At the time of their clinical trials, the molecular target of APX3330 had not been confirmed and was not known to be the Ref-1 protein.

Across these 10 trials, it was found that APX3330 exhibits predictable pharmacokinetics that were consistent with the pharmacokinetic data obtained in non-clinical studies. In addition, there was a lack of significant acute toxicity at doses up to 600 mg/day. Moreover, in two studies it was found that meals have no impact on the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics. In these trials, only a single patient reported mild orbital-region discomfort (60 mg/day). In addition, there was a slightly higher incidence (< 10%) of mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and mild to moderate symptoms related to skin rash or irritation in patients given APX3330 compared to placebo.

Clinical development of APX3330 by Eisai Co., Ltd. in Japan was suspended with the in-licensing of anti-viral and biological agents for hepatitis C and rheumatoid arthritis. Later, while doing research on the Ref-1 protein, Dr. Mark Kelley from Indiana University and others identified that the molecular target of APX3330 was the Ref-1 protein. The elucidation of the mechanism of action with which APX3330 modulated the Ref-1 protein, and the concurrent advancement in understanding the role played by Ref-1 as a critical “gate-keeper” for controlling a variety of pro-inflammatory transcription factors led to the establishment of Apexian in order to determine the utility of using APX3330 as a modulator of the Ref-1 protein in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The clinical trial, APX_CLN_0011 under IND 125360 with the FDA Division of Oncology, was initiated by Apexian in order to identify the highest dose of APX3330 that could be safely administered in a chronic manner and to confirm molecular engagement of APX3330 with the Ref-1 protein by obtaining tumor biopsy samples and circulating tumor cell samples. Details of this trial are as follows:
 

• | APX_CLN_0011 was a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 oncology trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received daily oral doses of APX3330 each day of repeated 21-day cycles until disease progression or trial withdrawal. Nineteen patients received APX3330 in escalating doses from 240 mg/d dose to 720 mg/d in increments of 120mg/d. The top dose tested (720 mg/d) produced a self-limiting, diffuse macular rash and was confirmed as the dose-limiting toxicity. The dose of 600 mg/d was then confirmed as a dose tolerable for chronic administration and for further clinical development as a modulator of Ref-1 activity in inflammatory diseases. Biopsy analyses of patients participating in the trial confirmed that APX3330 directly targets the Ref-1 protein and that the targeting produces subsequent regulation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and HIF-1α, regulators of VEGF and other inflammatory molecules. This mechanism of action provides significant rationale for testing APX3330 in diseases in which inflammation and neo-vascular development play a critical pathogenic role.

APX3330 Clinical Safety
 
In administration to 346 healthy volunteers or patients, over 220 of whom were given the product candidate for an average of 75 days or more, APX3330 has been demonstrated to be well-tolerated. Ten percent of patients experienced a self-limiting rash, nausea, or diarrhea. Additionally, there was a lack of significant acute neurologic, cardiovascular, liver, or pulmonary toxicity. APX3330 systemically given up to 600 mg/day as oral therapy had few adverse effects in the eye, with only one patient at 60 mg/day (in CLN_0006) reporting an eye-related adverse event mild in nature (orbital region discomfort).
 
Safety data were collected for the five Phase 1 and five Phase 2 trials run by Eisai as well as the Phase 1 trial run by Apexian. In the 75 patients receiving either placebo or treatment in the five Phase 1 trials (CLN_0001, 2, 3, 4, and 8), five patients in the treatment arms experienced adverse events (mild diarrhea at doses of 120 mg, 180 mg, or 240 mg per day). In the five Phase 2 trials, of the 279 patients given APX3330, 40 (14%) had adverse events, the majority of which were mild. The specific adverse events for the five Phase 2 trials are listed in the TABLE 7. Lastly, in the Phase 1 trial, APX_CLN_0011, patients received higher doses of APX3330, up to 720 mg/day. Two patients who received 720 mg/day had a diffuse, macular rash that was spontaneously reversible. Of note, patients who had been taking doses up to 600 mg/day did not have any signs of acute toxicity. Moreover, of the 19 patients in the APX_CLN_0011 Phase 1 trial described above, four patients had over 6 months of exposure, and three patients (at a dose of 600 mg/day) had over 300 days of exposure without an adverse event. TABLE 7 shows a summary of adverse events for Phase 2 APX3330 trials.
 
Given the AE profile of APX3330 in patients with advanced stage cancers, Ocuphire expects that administration of APX3330 to patients with retinal diseases will not result in any significant toxicity or safety issues that would interfere with chronic oral administration.

APX3330 and Analogs Preclinical Efficacy Studies
 
Ref-1 is highly expressed within many cells in the diseased retina. Studies have demonstrated that it is upregulated in the retina and choroid of human wAMD patient eyes compared with age-matched controls (FIGURE 13). Furthermore, in an in vitro study of adult human retinal pigment epithelium cells treated with oxLDL, an agent that upregulates factors involved in inflammation and angiogenesis, APX3330 reduced transcriptional activity of many of these key factors, namely HIF-1α and NF-κB. This reduces the activity of their downstream targets, VEGF, and that of inflammatory mediators.
 
In animal studies, APX3330 delivered orally, intraperitoneally or intravitreally (directly into the eye), and APX2009 and APX2014 delivered intraperitoneally via injections reduced neovascularization in mouse models that recapitulate features of retinal neovascularization (seen in PDR and wAMD) called the L-CNV model. Although intravitreal injection is the delivery route of the standard-of-care anti-VEGF biologics and ensures that the drug gets to the affected area, in humans it is labor-intensive, causes patient discomfort, and incurs a risk of potentially vision-threatening intraocular infections. As a result, systemic administration (intraperitoneal injections) of Ref-1 inhibitors were explored for similar effects as that seen by anti-VEGF biologics in mouse models. Treatment of APX3330 (10 mg/kg) via oral gavage in rats with type 1 diabetes and induced stroke (conditions that promote neovascularization) shows a significant decrease (~55%) of VEGF signaling (or lesion volume) as shown in FIGURE 14 below. Intraperitoneal injections of APX2009 showed comparable results in the same mouse model (see JPET 2018).

While numerous published studies using APX3330 through intravitreal or systemic intraperitoneal administration have shown successful neovascularization reduction, additional studies with oral administration of 2 doses of APX3330 (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg per day) resulted in a more robust correction of the lesion volume in the L-CNV mouse model. As shown in FIGURE 15 below, animals treated with APX3330 displayed a significant reduction (~55%) in the volume of the neovascular lesion (red staining).

L-CNV mice treated with APX3330 at either 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg resulted in a decreased volume of neovascularization (lesion volume).
 
Human pharmacokinetics of APX3330 demonstrated plasma levels much greater than those seen in animals. Pharmacological studies with APX3330 in preclinical models demonstrated that, at a dose of 25 mg/kg, (equivalent to a 120 mg daily dose in humans), there was an APX3330 concentration (expressed as blood quinone) of 0.15-2 μg/ml, which resulted in an ocular effect in preclinical models. This plasma concentration was adequate to reach detectable levels in the retina and provide efficacy in reducing neovascularization. In support of these findings, APX3330 was detected in the eyes of mice using a lesser dose of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, in clinical trials, a daily dose of 120 mg resulted in a peak blood concentrations of 40 μg/ml, which is 20x times higher than those in mouse models (FIGURE 16). Doses of 120 mg per day and higher in humans were tolerable, as studied in the Phase 1 clinical trial, APX_CLN_011, where the maximally tolerated dose was 600 mg per day. Thus, the planned dose of 600 mg per day is five times above the 120 mg human equivalent dose shown to achieve retinal efficacy in animals.

APX3330 Nonclinical Toxicology Studies
 
Pharmacokinetics/Metabolism
 
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats and dogs to understand the absorption, distribution, and elimination of APX3330. APX3330 is well absorbed orally with a bioavailability of ≥ 60%. In the bloodstream, ≥ 99% of the product candidate is bound to protein. Half-life after intravenous administration of APX3330 was 8 hours in rats, 7.8 to 8.7 hours in dogs, and 25.5 hours in monkeys. Excretion occurred mainly in bile, as a conjugate. In rats and beagles, APX3330 is excreted in stool as the unchanged compound.
Toxicology
 
Over 15 single- and repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs up to 3 months duration have been conducted. Also, developmental, genotoxicity, and antigenicity studies have been completed. The key toxicology findings that inform the design and conduct of Ocuphire’s clinical trials include that APX3330 was weakly toxic producing mortality only at the highest dose of 2000 mg/kg. Soft and muddy stool (diarrhea) was the most remarkable finding in dogs treated with doses up to 100 mg/kg for 3 months. Shorter-term repeat-dose studies at 100 or 200 mg/kg induced increased leakage of liver enzymes and evidence of inflammatory infiltration, but evidence of necrosis was absent. APX3330 was not genotoxic and had no toxicologically significant effects in developmental studies. The FDA has agreed to a 24-week clinical trial without the need for further toxicology studies.

Ocuphire Clinical Development Plan
 
For Nyxol, the investigational new drug (IND) application was submitted to the FDA Division of Ophthalmology in July 2011 and is in effect (IND 70499). Nyxol has completed three Phase 1 trials and four Phase 2 trials, mostly in young and older healthy volunteers as well as NVD and glaucoma patients. In May 2020, Ocuphire completed an EOP2 meeting with the FDA, which included a discussion and agreement around the design and scope of future registration trials for Nyxol. Ocuphire anticipates engaging in similar discussions with other foreign regulatory authorities in the future.
 
For APX3330, the IND application for APX3330 to pursue retinal choroidal vascular diseases was submitted to the FDA Division of Ophthalmology in December 2018 and is in effect (IND 142152). APX3330 also has an IND with the FDA Division of Oncology for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (IND 125360). APX3330 has completed five Phase 1 and five Phase 2 trials, mostly related to liver disease and patients with solid tumors.
 
Ocuphire initiated three mid and late-stage clinical trials in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 for Nyxol (two Phase 3 trials and one Phase 2 trial) and plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for APX3330 in the first quarter of 2021. The development programs for Ocuphire’s targeted indications are described below.
 
Ongoing and Planned Nyxol Trials:
 
NVD: LYNX-1 Phase 3 Trial
 
Ocuphire initiated LYNX-1, a Phase 3 double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, multi-dose trial in patients with severe NVD in the fourth quarter of 2020 as planned in the United States. The LYNX-1 trial is expected to enroll approximately 160 patients for the treatment of NVD. The trial is expected to enroll severe self-reported NVD and among other criteria include patients showing improvement potential in mesopic LCVA during illumination of the contralateral eye with a flashlight. Eligible participants are expected to be administered a single drop of Nyxol or placebo in each eye daily before bedtime for 14 days. The primary endpoint is a statistically significant improvement of 3 lines or greater in mesopic low contrast best-corrected distance visual acuity at 7 days. Key secondary endpoints are pupil diameter, wavefront aberrometry (measured on OPD-Scan III analyzer), distance and near high contrast visual acuity, and psychometric questionnaire. Patient safety is assessed by AE monitoring, conjunctival redness monitoring, IOP monitoring, and assessments of heart rate and blood pressure. Ocuphire expects to report top-line data for this chronic indication Phase 3 registration trial in the third quarter of 2021.
RM: MIRA-2 Phase 3 Trial
 
Ocuphire initiated MIRA-2, a Phase 3, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial in normal healthy patients in the fourth quarter of 2021 as planned in the United States. The MIRA-2 trial is expected to evaluate the effect of Nyxol to reverse pharmacologically induced mydriasis. The trial was expected to enroll approximately 168 healthy patients, and ultimately enrolled 185. Eligible patients were administered a mydriatic (phenylephrine, tropicamide, and a combination thereof) and then given 1 or 2 drops of Nyxol approximately 1 hour later after max pupil diameter, and then measured at multiple time points from 30 min to 6 hours and 24 hours. The primary endpoint is a statistically significant improvement in the percent of patients who return to within 0.2 mm of their pupil diameter baseline at 90 minutes, with 60 minutes also being evaluated. Key secondary endpoints are pupil diameter at all other timepoints, accommodation, and time savings. Patient safety is assessed by AE monitoring, conjunctival redness monitoring, visual acuity, IOP, and vital sign assessments (heart rate and blood pressure). Ocuphire expects to report top-line data for this acute indication Phase 3 registration trial in the first quarter of 2021.
Presbyopia: VEGA-1 Phase 2 Trial
 
Ocuphire initiated VEGA-1, a Phase 2 proof of concept, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial in patients with presbyopia in the first quarter of 2021 as planned in the United States. The VEGA-1 trial is designed to evaluate the effect of a kit combination with Nyxol and low dose pilocarpine for temporary treatment of presbyopia. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 152patients with a clinical diagnosis of presbyopia (20/50 or worse near vision). The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with at least 3 lines (15 letters or more) of binocular distance corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) improvement on a standard near vision eye chart. Key secondary endpoints at multiple timepoints are 3 lines DCNVA without loss in distance vision, pupil diameter, and percent of patients with improvements in DCNVA at 1 and 2 lines of the combination compared to placebo and each component. Patient safety is assessed by AE monitoring, conjunctival redness monitoring, distance visual acuity, IOP and vital sign assessments (heart rate and blood pressure). Ocuphire expects to report top-line data for the Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2021.
 
 45
 
 
Planned APX3330 Trial:
 
DR / DME: ZETA-1 Phase 2 Trial
 
Ocuphire expects to initiate ZETA-1, a Phase 2 double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial in patients with DR and DME in the first quarter of 2021. The ZETA-1 trial is expected to enroll 100 patients to evaluate the effect of 600 mg daily dose of APX3330 (3 120 mg tablets in AM, and 2 120 mg tablets in PM) in treating patients with DR, including moderately severe NPDR to mild PDR, as well as patients with DME without loss of central vision. The primary endpoint is percent of patients with a ≥2 step improvement on the Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Score (DRSS) at week 24. Key secondary endpoints at multiple timepoints are central subfield thickness and low luminance high contrast distance visual acuity. Patient safety is assessed by AE monitoring, clinical laboratory evaluations, IOP, and vital sign assessments. Ocuphire expects to report top-line data for the Phase 2 trial by early 2022.
Future Clinical Plans for Nyxol and APX3330:
 
Upon completion of the planned Nyxol trials, Ocuphire would expect to complete the additional registration trials for Nyxol in RM and NVD indications and conduct both a chronic safety and acute safety exposure trial as well as any required pediatric trials prior to submitting the NDA. For chronic administration of Nyxol, Ocuphire has initiated a 6-month repeated-dose toxicity study with Nyxol in Dutch belted rabbits to support the long-term safety exposure trial. The planned chronic safety exposure is 500 healthy volunteers with daily dosing of Nyxol for 14 days (treatment period), then 300 volunteers for 6 months, followed by 100 volunteers for 12 months. The planned acute safety exposure is 300 healthy volunteers followed for 24 hours. Also, as either a standalone or part of one of the trials, short term pharmacokinetics (PK) and long-term endothelial cell count (ECC) clinical data will be collected as well as a 6-month toxicological rabbit study to support the chronic indications. Pending the results and timing of additional trials, Ocuphire intends to file a new drug application (NDA) for one or more indications in early 2023. Further, based on the Phase 2 safety, tolerability and efficacy results of Nyxol and low dose pilocarpine in patients with presbyopia, Ocuphire expects that a Phase 3 trial will be appropriately designed to support registration.
 
Based on the Phase 2 safety, tolerability and efficacy results of APX3330 in patients with DR/DME, Ocuphire expects to request an EOP2 meeting with the FDA to finalize the design of the Phase 3 registration trials for APX3330 in addition to defining the chronic safety exposure trial and any further animal toxicology studies necessary prior to an NDA submission.
 
Future In-Licensing and Acquisition Opportunities
 
Ocuphire’s team and advisors are screening additional product candidates for potential in-license or acquisition in order to expand and diversify its pipeline. Ocuphire continually evaluates product candidates based on scientific merit, patent protection, regulatory pathways, and commercial opportunity. Its focus is on small molecule product candidates in the ophthalmology space and Ocuphire is at various stages of discussions to acquire such candidates.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
If any of Ocuphire’s product candidates are approved in the United States or globally, Ocuphire has the option to either build out a commercial infrastructure directly or collaborate with established pharmaceutical partners. The company maintains discussions with a range of ophthalmic drug companies regarding development and commercialization of Nyxol and/or APX3330, including co-development, distribution, license, or mergers and acquisitions. There are several global pharmaceuticals with major ophthalmic drug businesses as well as numerous other smaller global or regional companies that could provide significant reach in specific markets such as Europe or Asia. In addition, there are several ophthalmic drug sales and distribution companies in the U.S. with established specialty salesforces that could market Nyxol or APX3330. The ophthalmic market is concentrated and therefore Ocuphire believes it is feasible to reach eye care providers (~18,000 Ophthalmologists, ~40,000 Optometrists, ~3,000 Retinal Specialists) via direct sales force (e.g. 30-100 reps) or by multiple ophthalmic distributors and partners.

Manufacturing
 
For Nyxol, APX3330, and for other product candidates that will be developed in the future, Ocuphire’s contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce, its bulk drug substances and drug products for use in Ocuphire’s preclinical studies and clinical trials, utilizing reliable and reproducible synthetic processes and common manufacturing techniques. Ocuphire does not have any long-term arrangements but intends to secure such arrangements for drug substances or drug products as appropriate, and currently uses purchase orders with multiple manufacturers. Ocuphire expects to enter into one or more Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) agreements in the near term. Ocuphire further intends to qualify its selected manufacturers to provide bulk drug substances and drug products in preparation for the NDA regulatory submission to the FDA. Ocuphire plans to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of its drug substances and drug products, if approved, for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities. Ocuphire does not own or operate, and currently has no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities.
Nyxol
 
 The protected formulation of Nyxol is a sterile, preservative-free, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution containing phentolamine mesylate (1.0%), mannitol, and sodium acetate. The drug substance phentolamine mesylate USP is a small molecule that can be manufactured by reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. Ocuphire obtains the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Nyxol from a single supplier in Italy and is presently taking steps to develop a second source. All lots of drug substance phentolamine mesylate and Nyxol drug product used in clinical trials are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), a quality-system regulating manufacturing. Ocuphire is in the process of transitioning the container closure system to an industry standard single use preservative-free blow-fill-seal (“BFS”) container which should further enhance the current stability of Nyxol. Other BFS marketed products have successfully scaled commercial batches at 500 liters. Nyxol has demonstrated stability at 5°C refrigerated for a minimum of two years. Ocuphire is also planning additional stability studies for future lots of both the drug substance and drug product of Nyxol in order to establish expiry and to support regulatory approval and commercial stage.
 
APX3330
 
APX3330 is an oral formulation of a small molecule drug substance that is synthesized as a crystalline single polymorph from readily available raw materials and using conventional chemical processes. The active pharmaceutical ingredient for APX3330 is currently obtained from a single supplier in India, although alternative manufacturing sources are available. Process and analytical development of APX3330 drug product have been completed, and its production has been scaled-up under cGMP regulatory requirements. Previously the APX3330 drug product manufacturer has performed pharmaceutical development to support the cGMP manufacturing campaign for tablets of 60 mg and 120 mg dose strengths to be used in future clinical trials. Under this tablet size, long-term ICH-stability studies of various strengths (60 and 120 mg tablet) have been conducted and have demonstrated a 3-year shelf life when stored at 25°C/60% relative humidity. Ocuphire is evaluating 150 mg or 300 mg tablets for even more convenient twice a day dosing. Ocuphire is also planning additional stability studies for future lots of both the drug substance and drug product of APX3330 in order to establish expiry and to support regulatory approval and commercial stage.
 
Apexian Sublicense Agreement
 
On January 21, 2020, Ocuphire entered into the Apexian Sublicense Agreement, pursuant to which it obtained exclusive worldwide patent and other intellectual property rights that constitute a Ref-1 Inhibitor program relating to therapeutic applications to treat disorders related to ophthalmic and diabetes mellitus conditions. The lead compound in the Ref-1 Inhibitor program is APX3330, which Ocuphire intends to develop as an oral tablet therapeutic to treat DR and DME, and potentially wAMD. See “Ocuphire Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations and Commitments—Apexian Sublicense Agreement” for more details regarding the Apexian Sublicense Agreement.

A counterpart patent application directed to aqueous phentolamine mesylate is pending in Canada, where a patent, if granted, based on this pending patent application would expire in year 2034. In the same patent family, Ocuphire also has 1 pending U.S. patent application with additional claims to aqueous phentolamine mesylate formulations, whereby such patents, if granted, would expire in year 2034. The patents and patent applications cover the current clinical formulation for the Nyxol product.
 
Ocuphire’s U.S. Patent Nos. 9,089,560 and 9,789,088 contain claims directed to methods of improving visual performance using, for example, phentolamine mesylate and are scheduled to expire in year 2034. Counterpart patents have issued in Australia, Europe, and Japan, which are scheduled to expire in year 2034. A counterpart patent application is pending in Canada, along with a further patent application pending in the U.S. Patents, if granted, based on these pending applications would expire in year 2034. The patents and patent applications cover uses of the current clinical formulation for the Nyxol product.
 
Ocuphire’s pending international patent application PCT/US2019/056324 is directed to treating glaucoma and other medical disorders using phentolamine mesylate. Patents, if granted, based on this pending international application would expire in year 2039. Ocuphire’s pending international patent application PCT/US2019/058182 is directed to methods of treating presbyopia, mydriasis, and other medical disorders; such patents, if granted, based on this pending international application would expire in year 2039. Currently, two U.S. patent applications are pending based on international patent application PCT/US2019/058182, one with claims to treating presbyopia and the other U.S. application with claims to treating mydriasis. Our international patent application PCT/US2019/058182 and related U.S. patent application with claims to treating presbyopia include methods of treating presbyopia using phentolamine mesylate in combination with pilocarpine. 
 
 Ocuphire also owns an issued patent in Mexico that is scheduled to expire in year 2025 and has claims to ophthalmic formulations.
 
Ocuphire has registered trademark protection in the United States for the mark NYXOL®.
 
APX3330
 
The patent estate that Ocuphire has in-licensed for APX3330 and related compounds contains five U.S. patents and five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, as well as issued patents in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, and pending patent applications in Europe, Japan, Canada, China, South Korea and Australia. The license is for the use and commercialization of APX3330 and related composition of matter compounds covered by the subject patents and patent applications in the field of human health uses for ophthalmic and diabetes mellitus indications.
 
 48
 
 
In-licensed U.S. patent 9,040,505 has claims to methods of treating diabetic retinopathy and other diseases using, for example, APX3330 and is scheduled to expire in year 2030. Counterpart patents have issued in Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada, which are scheduled to expire in year 2028, and there is a related pending U.S. patent application with method of treatment claims that, if issued as a patent, would expire in year 2028. Pending US application 16,968,009 and pending applications in Europe, Japan, Canada, China, South Korea and Australia have claims to methods of treating wAMD and other diseases using, for example, APX3330, along with other formulations such as APX2009 and APX2014. These patents, if granted, would expire in year 2039. The U.S. and certain foreign countries permit extension of patent term for up to five years to compensate for patent term lost during the government regulatory review process for a new medicine. If U.S. patent 9,040,505 qualifies for the full five years of patent term extension, the expiration of U.S. patent 9,040,505 would be in year 2035. Whether U.S. patent 9,040,505 qualifies for the full five years of patent term extension depends in part on the date of FDA approval for the new medicine, because a U.S. patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval.
 
In-licensed patent applications directed to a combination therapy composition comprising an APE1/REF-1 inhibitor, such as APX3330, and a second therapeutic agent, and methods of using such combination therapy to treat retinal diseases and/or treat other indications are pending in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Canada. Patents, if granted, would expire in year 2038. In-licensed patent applications directed to use of an APE1/REF-1 inhibitor, such as APX3330, in monotherapy or combination therapy to reduce neuronal sensitivity and/or treat other indications are pending in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Canada, whereby patents, if granted based on these applications, would expire in year 2038.
 
Patents that Ocuphire has in-licensed to derivatives of APX3330 include U.S. patents 9,089,605; 9,193,700; 9,877,936; and 10,154,973 and counterpart patents in Europe, Japan, China, and Canada that are scheduled to expire between the years 2028 to 2032. In-licensed patent applications to derivatives of APX3330 include a pending U.S. patent application as well as a patent application in Europe and other countries that, if a patent were issued, would expire from year 2028 to 2032.
 
Additional Background
 
As background, the patent term is typically 20 years from the date of filing a non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened several ways. First, patent term adjustment (PTA) compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. Second, in certain instances, a patent term extension (PTE) can be granted to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, as provided under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. This restoration period cannot be longer than 5 years for approval of a drug compound, and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only patent(s) applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the PTE and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days from market approval. Independent of patent protection, in the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a 5-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity (NCE). Under this provision, APX3330 may be eligible for up to 5 years of data and market exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act, because it is considered an NCE as the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the active ingredient of APX3330.
 
In Europe, under the Data Exclusivity Directive, pharmaceutical companies may receive up to 11 years to market their product without risk of competition. In Japan, under the Pharmaceuticals Act of Japan, the market authorization holder, based on the length of a required study period reexamination, may have up to 10 years before a generic can enter the market. Further, the expiration date of certain patents may be extended for up to a maximum of 5 additional years to accommodate for time spent seeking government approval to market a new medicine, in those countries that permit extension of patent term to accommodate for time spent seeking government approval to market a new medicine.
 
Ocuphire also protects its proprietary information through written agreements. Ocuphire’s employees, consultants, contractors, partners and other advisors are required to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of employment or engagement. In addition, Ocuphire protects its proprietary information through written confidentiality agreements with outside parties who may come into possession of Ocuphire’s confidential information.

Competition
 
There is intense competition within the pharmaceutical industry. While Ocuphire believes that its product candidates, Nyxol and APX3330, are well positioned for development in each indication, Ocuphire will face competition from both branded and generic pharmaceutical companies as well as products that are currently in development. Many of these companies have significantly greater financial and human resources and experience in drug development, R&D, and commercialization. These competitors compete with Ocuphire in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials as well as acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies complementary to Ocuphire program. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors if they choose to partner with large, established companies.
Nyxol
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of Nyxol, assuming Nyxol is approved, are likely to be the combination of durability, tolerability, convenience, price (private pay), and stable, preservative-free formulation that will potentially allow it to compete effectively in these markets.
 
Competition in NVD
 
NVD is a new indication in which Nyxol would be the first approved moderate ‘miotic’ drug. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for NVD nor is Ocuphire aware of any in development. Existing miotic agents are rarely used off-label given their limitations of tachyphylaxis (Alphagan P® (brimonidine), marketed by Allergan plc) and warnings in the labels of difficulties while driving at night or performing hazardous activities in poor illuminations (attributable to pilocarpine, a generic molecule marketed by various pharmaceutical companies at common doses of 1%, 2%, and 3%).
 
Competition in RM
 
There are currently no approved and available drug treatments for RM, and Ocuphire is not aware of any in development. Rev-Eyes® (dapiprazole), an alpha-1 antagonist, was approved by the FDA in 1990 to reverse mydriasis induced by adrenergic or anticholinergic agents. Rev-Eyes was withdrawn in the past from the market for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy, according to the FDA.
 
Competition in Presbyopia
 
There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for presbyopia, though several drug treatments are in development. Currently, the competition includes reading glasses, multifocal contact lenses, and monovision contact lenses (e.g., where one eye wears a near vision lens and the other eye wears a distance vision lens). Ocuphire will also compete against several pharmacological therapies in development for the temporary treatment of presbyopia, many of which are pilocarpine-based pupil management therapies, including:
 
Presbysol® (AGN-190584), with 1.25% pilocarpine, developed by Allergan plc (NDA application submitted February 2021).
 
Presbidrops® (CSF-1), with low dose pilocarpine and a secondary agent (lubricant), developed by Orasis Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
 

• | Liquid Vision®, with aceclidine (another miotic agent), developed by Presbyopia Therapies, LLC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MicroLine®, which is a microdose formulation of pilocarpine, developed by Eyenovia, Inc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | KT-101, which uses pilocarpine in the AcuStream delivery system, developed by Kedalion Therapeutics, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BrimocholTM, with brimonidine and carbachol (both are miotic agents), developed by Visus Therapeutics, Inc.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | UNR844, which uses a mechanism that involves softening the lens to increase near visual acuity, developed by Novartis AG (originally Encore Vision, Inc.).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are a few approved devices for presbyopia. One of these is the KAMRA Inlay, developed by AcuFocus, Inc. and marketed by SightLife Surgical, Inc. Another is the Eyelike NoanPinhole, developed by Koryo Eyetech, the first commercially available pinhole soft contact lens. Nyxol would not directly compete against these devices, but rather would be a non-invasive alternative for presbyopes who are averse to surgical intervention.
 
APX3330
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of APX3330, assuming APX3330 is approved, are likely to be its oral form, tolerability, durability, price, and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Competition in Diabetic Retinopathy / Diabetic Macular Edema / wAMD
 
Ocuphire believes that APX3330, if approved, could have a competitive advantage in the DR/DME/wAMD markets because it is an oral tablet with a dual mechanism and potential to address multiple indications. However, Ocuphire may face potential competition from both existing therapies and those in development. Current therapies for these retinal diseases rely on suppressing the activity of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) via intravitreal injection or by mitigating the inflammation via intravitreal corticosteroid-releasing implants including:

• | Lucentis® (ranibizumab) and Avastin® (bevacizumab), which are anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody intravitreal injections, developed by Genentech, Inc.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | EYLEA® (aflibercept), a VEGF inhibitor intravitreal injection, developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beovu® Brolucizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody intravitreal injection, developed by Novartis AG.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MACUGEN® (pegaptanib sodium injection), a selective inhibitor of VEGF-165, developed by Bausch + Lomb.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ozurdex® (dexamethasone), a corticosteroid IVT implant, developed by Allergan plc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Iluvien (fluocinolone acetonide), a corticosteroid IVT implant, developed by Alimera Sciences, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are also several pharmacological therapies in development, including:
 

• | Abicipar, an anti-VEGF intravitreal injection with a long duration of action, developed by Allergan plc and Molecular Partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Farcimab, a bispecific antibody intravitreal injection that suppresses both VEGF and Angiopoietin-2, developed by Genentech, Inc. and Roche AG.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | KSI-301, an anti-VEGF antibody intravitreal injection coupled with a biopolymer that is intended to increase the time between injections, developed by Kodiak Sciences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | OPT-302, an intravitreal injection which binds to multiple types of VEGF receptors that could be used with other anti-VEGF agents, developed by Opthea Limited.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ALG-1001, an integrin peptide therapy intravitreal injection that is being evaluated as a sequential or in-combination therapy with bevacizumab in patients with DME, developed by Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
The EMA is a decentralized agency governed by an independent management board responsible for the evaluation, supervision, and safety monitoring of medicines in the EU. The Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency serves a similar function to the FDA in the United States and is an independent administrative institution. The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is the Chinese agency for regulating drugs and medical devices (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration or CFDA).
 
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance, as applicable, with the Animal Welfare Act and FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 52
 
 

• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as 6-month toxicology studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as 6-month toxicology studies, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the candidate product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the candidate product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
The IND and IRB Processes
 
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND goes into effect 30-days after its filing, unless during this 30-day period the FDA raises concerns or questions and imposes a clinical hold.
 
A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. The FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial after a clinical trial has begun.
 
 53
 
 
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval, including that such trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and obtaining informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human patients enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 
In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must exercise continuing supervision over the trial. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by Ocuphire based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in 3 sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.
 

• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human patients or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 54
 
 
Reports detailing activities under and the status of an IND must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2020 is $2,942,965 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2020 is $325,424. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. The goal for review of most standard applications is within 10 months from the date of filing, and for “priority review” products the review goal is within 6 months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for 3 additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS at the time of approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
 55
 
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Priority Review Designations
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation.
 
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Third, the FDA may designate a product for Priority Review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 months to 6 months.
 
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in 2 or 6 months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
 56
 
 
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
 57
 
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug sample distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 
NDAs for most new drug products are based on 2 adequate and well-controlled clinical trials which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to an NDA for a drug for which the investigations to show whether the drug is safe and effective and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
 
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based in part on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA generally must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. The FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
 
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred to as the Orange Book. Clinicians and pharmacists often consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing clinicians or patient.
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 
 58
 
 
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period applies to the condition(s) of use for which the new clinical investigation was conducted, and often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product.
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed, (2) the listed patent has expired, (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 
 59
 
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trial or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional 6 months to the term of any patent or regulatory exclusivity, including orphan exclusivity. This 6-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, the latest statutory or regulatory period of exclusivity or patent covering the product is extended by 6 months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for 7 years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to 5 years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. Ocuphire cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension, in connection with any of its product candidates.

The 21st Century Cures Act
 
On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early-stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 
With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; and provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections.
 
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, Ocuphire would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
 61
 
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one-member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Within this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a generic medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the reference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC.
 
Hybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was authorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid application may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at the community level.
 
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
 
Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the E.U. member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each E.U. member state in which a trial is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.
 
 62
 
 
 In April 2014, the E.U. passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014. The new Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the E.U., including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation has been delayed. The Clinical Trials Directive may be replaced with the new  Clinical Trials Regulation in late 2022.
 
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided into two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned, and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned); strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 
In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 
 63
 
 
Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the European Union. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinically relevant superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.
 
Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
 
As in the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, including compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the European Union.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 
 64
 
 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for its product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require Ocuphire to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of its product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in Ocuphire’s commercialization efforts.
 
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of Ocuphire placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
Healthcare Law and Regulation
 
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain Ocuphire’s business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 65
 
 

• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report specially to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to clinicians and teaching hospitals and clinician ownership and investment interests; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been several federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 
In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government healthcare programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to Ocuphire’s potential drug candidates are:
 

• | a special, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 66
 
 

• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
There may be additional legislative changes, including potentially repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the ACA. It remains to be seen, however, whether new legislation will be enacted and, if so, precisely what any new legislation will provide and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. It is possible that any repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. While the timing and scope of any potential future legislation to repeal and replace ACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, it is also possible that some of the ACA provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with ACA coverage expansion provisions.
 
Employees
 
As of  December 31, 2020, Ocuphire had five employees. All were full-time, one of whom holds a Ph.D. degree and was engaged in research and development activities, two of whom were engaged in research and development activities and also engaged in business development, finance, human resources, or administrative support and two of whom were engaged in finance, human resources, or administrative support. Ocuphire is evaluating candidates for several senior full-time positions but plans to continue to utilize expert consultants and contract organizations to execute the day-to-day operations. None of Ocuphire’s employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. Ocuphire believes that it maintains good relations with its employees.
